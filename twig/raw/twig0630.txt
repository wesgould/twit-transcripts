[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   It's time for Twig this week and Google's Stacey Higginbotham is here and Pruitt's here
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.400]   filling in for Jeff Jarvis, the great Jason Howell, Microsoft's got a new Android phone.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.920]   We'll talk about that.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.040]   Facebook's got a new portal.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.040]   Amazon has a new Kindle Paperwhite, a little postage-stapsized solar panel, and why Lithuania
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.760]   says throw away those Chinese phones.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.840]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.520]   This week in Google, episode 630, recorded Wednesday, September 22, 2021.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.120]   Did you plug it in for TOEFL?

[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.040]   How does decentralized finance work?
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.440]   Modern Finance podcast hosted by Kevin Rose looks to answer these questions and many more
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.600]   about the investment marketplace.

[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.520]   This week in Google, the show we talk about the latest from the Google verse and the world's
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.640]   there on with us.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.200]   Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com, the IOT podcast.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   Hello Stacey.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   Hello, y'all.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   Oh, here.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   Let me know.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   No, no.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   Why?
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   Why?
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.400]   Well, because I don't need them for doing this.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.680]   Glasses make you look smart.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   Er.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.280]   You know I'm smart.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280]   I know.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   That's true.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   You don't need the glasses.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   It's overkill.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   It's over.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.080]   Now you're too smart.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   True.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.200]   That's Aunt Pruitt making sure Leo stays in line.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   Twit.tv/hop.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.120]   That's right.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.920]   And community manager over at the club Twit.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.240]   How you be, sir?
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.160]   You ought to wait because you had to get up bright and early.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.120]   I've been here in my third fourth show of the day.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   He's running on fumes.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   He's ranking it out.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.280]   I'm expecting some punchiness.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.240]   I don't know why, but I'm always punchy on this show.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.200]   The punchiest show I do.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   It's my Friday.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   It's my Friday.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.920]   That's the last Friday afternoon show.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.320]   I usually have a six pack right before the show.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.400]   I've seen the beer bomb in your office.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   I know.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.560]   Okay, so Jeff's not here, but Jason Hell is sitting in for Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.120]   Jason Hell from all about Android and Tech News Weekly.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.640]   Our producer, as a matter of fact, because--
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.120]   Yeah, so I'm going to be doing double duty.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.920]   I'm going to be talking some times.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.640]   And then I'm going to be taking notes.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   He warned me earlier.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.560]   He said there's nothing to talk about.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.480]   I said, welcome to Twit.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.720]   We don't need anything to talk about.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.920]   That's part of the fun of it.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.320]   Actually, I was up early 8 AM, my time, 11 AM Eastern
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.960]   for the Surface event, Microsoft's new Surface event.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   And they announced new laptops.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.600]   But one of the things they did announce
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.160]   that I thought was interesting, they came back
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.840]   and did the second version of their folding phone, which
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.120]   to all reports was not a huge success first time around.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.920]   But Microsoft's decided they're going to try again.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.600]   I bought the original duo a year ago
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.280]   and returned it within a couple of weeks.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.560]   I think they have a 30 day return policy, which is good,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.040]   because there was $1,500, got my money back.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.440]   But this one answers a lot of the concerns, the complaints
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.680]   we had originally.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.480]   For one thing, it has a decent camera system this time.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.600]   Three lenses, telephoto, medium and wide.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.520]   They look like a decent camera.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.040]   It's not going to be--
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.520]   nobody's trying to keep up with the iPhone.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.920]   Well, everybody's trying to keep up with the iPhone,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.400]   but nobody's succeeding.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.000]   But I think it'll be OK.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.640]   They're also answering another qualm people had,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.760]   which is when it was closed--
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.800]   it's a two screen device with a hinge.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.400]   So it's like a little book.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.960]   And when it was closed, you had no indication
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960]   about what was going on inside.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.120]   So you've solved that by adding a little bit of a screen
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.560]   on the edge there to let you know what time it is,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.640]   how much battery is left.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.160]   If you've got notifications, it'll
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.880]   even signal as if the phone is ringing.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.120]   They've added NFC, which it didn't have before.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.720]   It's a fast processor, 8 gigs of RAM, 888 Snapdragon.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.080]   So in every case, they've upgraded it significantly.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.720]   And it's running Android 11.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.000]   Comes out October 21st.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.360]   Oh, 12 will be out by then, right, Jason?
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.040]   12 will just be out by then.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.720]   I mean, the guess is that 12 is going to be out sometime
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.320]   early October.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.640]   But that's like the initial launch.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.080]   I kind of understand when a hardware company releases
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.600]   a device within the first month of a brand new OS.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.400]   Although it is pretty amazing when a new device actually
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.160]   launches with the brand new OS.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   That seems like a missed opportunity sometimes.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.320]   I think the big deal here and realizing
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.560]   that I'm merely a third person observer of the original device
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   of this, I think I pod at it a little bit.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.320]   But I really didn't get a whole lot of firsthand experience
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.760]   with it is the processor.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.040]   Because my understanding of that first device--
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.400]   It was 855.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.120]   It was terrible.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.200]   And I think why this is good is because we're
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.840]   starting to see these foldables actually come out
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.040]   with the top of the line processor, which I think
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.840]   is really important.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.880]   Before they had to kind of ramp things down,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.840]   maybe it's a cost thing because these things were going
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.480]   to be expensive no matter what.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.240]   And so to kind of bring that cost down
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.840]   to a more palatable place, they ended up ramping it down
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.960]   with processors saying, people aren't getting this
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.880]   because of the processor.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.240]   They're getting this because it folds.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.320]   And that's pretty cool.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.040]   Now they're finally saying, well, wait a minute.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.280]   These are freaking expensive devices.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.440]   We should make them be able to stand up
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.880]   to the best devices out there.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.720]   So I think that's really good that they're doing that here.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.600]   As you saw when she holds it to her head, it's a little bit--
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.360]   I was going to say she did that wrong because nobody that age
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.320]   holds the phone that way.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.840]   They hold it like this.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.040]   They're talking into it.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.080]   They're talking to their ears.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.640]   Well, actually, I meant to ask you--
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.760]   I meant to ask you because you're the only person I know
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.600]   who's under 80 is--
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.120]   Jason and--
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.040]   I know I'm teasing.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.960]   I'm teasing.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.240]   It's a joke under 60.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.840]   I was watching billions on Sunday night on Showtime, which
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.640]   is back.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.360]   And it's one of my favorite shows.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.200]   They all have surfaces everywhere.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.960]   But what's interesting is nobody would ever
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.520]   make a phone call on this show.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.120]   Well, there are a few people, old people,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.760]   were holding the phone to the ear.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.100]   In every other respect, they were doing video calls,
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.680]   FaceTime or duo or something like that.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.320]   A lot of that is that just a TV show
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.960]   trying to show off Microsoft hardware?
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.320]   Or do people actually do that?
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.760]   Young person?
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.360]   I don't see any-- if you hang out with young people,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.400]   and they're actually forced to talk about that.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.680]   And this is a forced.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.520]   This is not something they do voluntarily.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.920]   They do this if they're talking in this video.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   Oh my god.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.840]   They're talking into the bottom of it.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.000]   Oh, yeah, my daughter.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.960]   She sits there and I'm like, OK, talk to grandma.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.440]   What?
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.680]   Why do they do that?
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   Hey, grandma.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.520]   Why are they doing that?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.240]   Is that from watching the Kardashians too much?
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.120]   Why are they doing that?
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.040]   That's a way to wear them.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.560]   I've never seen the Kardashians.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.040]   It's just--
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.000]   I hate to bring it to you.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.120]   Oh, folks do that too.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.640]   They hold it the same way.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.520]   It's true.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.640]   OK, can I explain folks--
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   My parents do.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.880]   Why people hold the phone that way?
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.080]   On TV, on reality shows, they hold the phone this way
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.880]   so that the camera operator, they put it on speaker phone
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.560]   so the camera operator could see their face
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.960]   and hear the call.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   It's completely an artificial thing
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.440]   that was started a few years ago for reality television.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.880]   But apparently, people have decided
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.640]   this is the new way to talk to the phone.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.960]   But everybody hears your dog call.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.240]   No, no, no, no.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.840]   You're on your headset.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   Oh.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.960]   So you're talking about what happens
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.680]   is you're on your headset.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.160]   You'll talk to them if you have to, like this.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.360]   But you're also looking stuff up on your phone
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.440]   because they're usually texting you pictures
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.480]   or something that's happening.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.160]   So that's different.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.360]   So they're talking to the microphone
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.480]   because they have headphones in.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.600]   Do we need to be able to be listening to the show?
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.360]   What we're doing?
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.520]   We're talking to the butt of the phone.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.680]   Sideways.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.920]   My parents are talking to the butt of the phone.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.080]   That's how they talk.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.760]   When I'm on the phone, 90% of the time, I've got an earbud in
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   and that's how I'm doing it.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.760]   You're not even--
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.760]   Yeah, because if you have earbuds in, I don't want to do that.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.120]   You've got a microphone.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.560]   You don't even-- you could put the phone down.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.800]   Full mobility confused.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.080]   But we're old-ish, sir.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.920]   We're not old.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.480]   Yeah, and like, yeah, my daughter, if she--
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.360]   again, she doesn't--
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.800]   the only people she talks on the phone to are my parents.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.240]   Like, her friends, they can never--
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.120]   Yeah, nobody else calls.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.680]   Yeah, yeah, we text.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.120]   Right.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.960]   We text.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.080]   I, for some reason, my 29-year-old daughter
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.480]   is old for her age because she said, I don't like to text.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.920]   Can I call you?
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.680]   And I was like, no, I want to text.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.560]   I don't want to call.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.720]   It's hard to call.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.320]   I don't like you.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.920]   So a dad gum cools her.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   I got a tea.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.200]   She's pretty dad gum.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.960]   She's very cool.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.000]   She actually-- she duo'd me this today, and that was OK.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.080]   So I'm thinking--
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.320]   I'm thinking--
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.160]   So by the way, I ordered the duo.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.000]   I'm embarrassed to admit on Windows Weekly.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   But I did it last year and returned it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.640]   You have a fairly flexible return policy.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.320]   I think it's 30 days, don't quote me.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.800]   But--
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.520]   I got to tell you, when you returned it last year,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.720]   it hurt my heart because I thought that thing had so much
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.360]   potential.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:00.920]   It hurt my heart.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.360]   It was--
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.340]   But when you returned it and told us about how clunky and bad
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.020]   it was, it really hurt my heart.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.980]   It wasn't a hard thing.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.380]   It was a nice device.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.620]   It was a software problem.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.780]   They didn't-- they didn't--
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.660]   they had all this promise with the two screens.
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.020]   And very few apps used it.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.100]   Some, like the Kindle app, you could turn it--
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.020]   like you were reading a book.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.780]   But it didn't-- and it didn't work well dragging things
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.660]   between-- and for instance, when you open Google Maps,
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.740]   where the hinge was, Maps thought was a screen.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.460]   It thought it was on a big screen.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.580]   So there's a portion of the map obscured by the hinge
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.260]   instead of just using two screens.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.460]   But that's things that can be fixed.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.340]   And my hope is this time.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.660]   So I wanted to give them another chance.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.180]   That's why.
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.100]   And it's going to have a good camera system this time.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.340]   It's so pricey, but it's a nice looking piece of hardware.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.420]   Well, I'm 1,500 bucks.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:51.940]   Well, what is--
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.580]   isn't as expensive as it used to be.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.540]   I mean, the iPhone was 12.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.580]   What was the-- what was the--
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.980]   oh, the Samsung Galaxy Fold?
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.980]   How much was that?
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.860]   That's the same price.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.860]   Actually, it's 2000.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.500]   OK.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.180]   No, the Fold is 1800 for the Z Fold.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.660]   For the introductory-- yeah, for the baseline.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.380]   I have too many phones at this point.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.020]   But I feel like, well, I should probably check them.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.460]   And I'm not going to get the new iPhone,
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.060]   because I don't think I need to.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   But I got the Z Flip.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.020]   Remember the Foldable.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.660]   And I like that a lot.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.260]   I'm sure I'll get the Pixel 6.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:24.780]   You don't--
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.340]   You're not going to start shooting in ProRes.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.020]   No, I don't-- no, no one's going to shoot in ProRes.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.340]   That's one of those things that they put in there,
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.420]   and everybody gets excited about, and then nobody uses.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.780]   I never used Dolby Vision the whole year that I had it on that 12.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.980]   So I'm not too worried about that.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.940]   You have to be a TikTok.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.060]   Permere or DaVinci Resolve and try to--
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.340]   No, I don't want to do that.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.540]   If I shoot video, it's just little clips of things
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.500]   that were happening.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.940]   And it's more for memories.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.580]   So I'd like to see what our wonderful editor, Mr. Nielsen,
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.620]   would do with the iPhone.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.060]   But he has a real camera, right?
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:00.540]   He does.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.700]   So he's going to shoot with a real camera most of the time.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.300]   So I'm going to argue right now that phone cameras can
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.620]   be real cameras.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.220]   I do too.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.620]   Not simply because I bought into the shot on the iPhone
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.980]   commercials, but I just think, again, the camera you have
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.100]   is the camera that is going to work.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.540]   And you can do a lot of really cool things
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.620]   with editing software and the existing cameras.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.300]   You agree, Mr. Photographer?
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.900]   I am a Resident in the US.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.420]   There are things that are phone, and I'm
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.780]   not just saying iPhone.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.940]   A phone just not going to be able to do that a regular, even
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.180]   APS-C camera can do.
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.060]   But that's not to say that the phones are just total crap
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.700]   and not useful for photography, but they're quite capable,
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.580]   especially with computational AI built into them.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.980]   So it's just going to make things a lot easier,
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.260]   and they'll still look pretty good.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.420]   You didn't like the white balance of the picture I
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.500]   took with the flip.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.620]   You didn't like the white balance.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.940]   You said it was blue.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.020]   Hey, well, that was user error.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.780]   That wasn't--
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.780]   That wasn't the camera ever.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.780]   You were right.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.780]   You were right.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.540]   You were just doing that white balance.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.940]   Oh, burn.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.900]   That's what I was going to be leading to next is Apple, Google,
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.900]   and Samsung, they do all these amazing ads,
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.660]   and they look great.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.740]   But they never really specify that the people operating
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.420]   those phone cameras are pros.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.980]   They understand that they need to have a certain type of light
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.220]   here or some back there.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.900]   And understand focus pool and stuff like that.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.420]   So that's why I said Mr. Nielsen,
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.460]   him holding that iPhone would be pretty dad-gum awesome,
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.860]   because he gets it.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.780]   He knows the crap.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.820]   Right.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.980]   Well, and I think a lot of times, as you say,
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.940]   they bring lights along with them if they're shooting the crap.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.300]   And so it's not really a real--
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.020]   I mean, it's not even just lights.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.460]   It's like stabilizing equipment, although now they
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.300]   have the stabilization on a lot of these devices.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.700]   I think it's rigs.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.340]   It's rigs that you have this tiny little phone that's
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.100]   like the center point and this huge rig behind it.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.820]   Like, that's a lot of production.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.100]   I think it was the Pixel 4, but with Miss Annie Leibovitz,
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.180]   when she was the spokesperson for it,
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.420]   and they did the little B roll of her shooting,
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.500]   this beautiful fashion.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.500]   That's right.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.100]   And what night?
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.540]   And if you paused it, you would see
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.300]   that she had a case around her phone for her handles
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.940]   on the side, because it can stabilize better that way.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.260]   You know?
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.500]   And if you're more stable, you're not
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.620]   going to get a bunch of motion blur and crispy shots and stuff.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.660]   But that's just a lot of things that most people don't
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.460]   tend to think about.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.340]   It's figure, oh, it's an iPhone.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.020]   It's the Pixel.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.860]   That's going to look good.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.820]   As soon as I click the shutter, I don't always--
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.940]   There's one thing I like about folding phones.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.980]   I liked about the Galaxy Fold.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.620]   And I think I will like about the Duo
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.460]   is that bigger viewfinder.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.740]   So when you open it up and you're taking a picture,
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.980]   you do see more of the picture.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.740]   Maybe I would notice that the white balance was off and fixed.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.140]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.780]   I mean, you look at that viewfinder.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.940]   You should have seen that the wonderful, beautiful,
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.140]   mistleast of a port had bluish skin tones.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.940]   Come on, man.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.540]   I thought you looked good, but all right.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.980]   It just shows what I know.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.500]   Anyway, I ordered one of these--
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.020]   Love is blind.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.260]   Yeah, love is blind.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.260]   My wife is blue.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:12.660]   Love is blind.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.820]   What are you talking about?
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.220]   Oh, she's not blue.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.140]   She's not blue.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.140]   Next time Quinn Perrou comes up asking me
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.900]   how something looks, I'm going to say I'm blind.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.540]   I love you.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:22.740]   Good.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.060]   All right.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.500]   I'm going to show you the picture.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500]   It's a little blue.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.220]   I admit it now that you told me.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.380]   See?
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.860]   But I wanted to see the red of the tongue.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.500]   I was going for the red.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.140]   It's beautiful saturation, but white balance is like--
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.100]   I could have fixed the white balance.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.500]   You are of discriminating taste, though,
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.900]   and you recognize this.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.020]   Me looking at this photo, like I see it when you mention it.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.740]   Yeah, I see it now, unfortunately.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.340]   Yeah, without being told about it, I probably--
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.980]   I would probably be so focused on the sharp red
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.540]   that the blue--
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.500]   You have the tongue pops.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.500]   --I wouldn't even notice.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.540]   Yeah, that saturation is beautiful.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.140]   Well, that's what I was really kind of showing.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.940]   This is the galaxy Flip Z, and I Flip 3,
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.500]   and I didn't really pay any attention to the white balance.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:07.940]   That's OK.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.660]   I know you're subscribed to Twit.tv/op.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.820]   I do, and I'm learning.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.300]   I'm getting better.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.620]   Just real quick before we move on,
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.220]   and one thing that you mentioned is
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.540]   that there are certain things that real cameras can't do--
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.420]   or sorry, can do that smartphones can't do.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.660]   The reality, though, is that for like 95% of people
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.060]   who are buying these phones, what the smartphone camera can do
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.500]   is way better than what real cameras--
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.420]   what they could even get out of a real camera
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.940]   if they had a real camera, because they're just not
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.900]   used to using a real camera or even knowing
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.260]   that it could do these things.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.660]   So--
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.420]   Yeah, I agree 100%.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.340]   I agree 100%.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.340]   Computation of photography makes stuff so much simpler.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.820]   It's literally just tap the shutter,
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.100]   but again, there's going to be some nuance on certain shots
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.260]   that for sure is just not going to cut it.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.300]   Well, and that's why I think we're all everybody,
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.540]   even Apple phone users and Google--
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.540]   I mean, Pixel--
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:09.980]   I'm sorry, Microsoft Duo is both a Google app and a--
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.780]   Yeah, but when's the trademark battle over that?
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.820]   Anyway, Microsoft Duo owners all are still thinking,
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.860]   well, let's see-- in fact, Mary Jo Foley even said that.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.740]   I think my phone's going to be the Pixel 6.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.580]   We're all waiting to see what Google does with the Pixel 6.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.260]   For the first time, we saw an image of the Pixel 6
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.260]   in somebody else's hands, not in Google's hands.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.020]   And it looks like it's got a shiny back on it, right?
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.380]   Yeah, it's a pretty glossy back.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.900]   It also got a possible launch date, right?
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.260]   Jason, what's the launch date?
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.740]   Do we know, October 19th?
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.780]   There was something-- yeah, I think I saw something
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.300]   along those lines from an Australian ad or something
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:52.800]   like that.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.300]   I can't remember.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.620]   I didn't look into that exactly.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.860]   Someone in the chat is going to probably link us to it.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.860]   But I mean, my understanding is that this
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.620]   is going to come late October, like mid-delayed October
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.340]   is about the time.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.980]   So we're about a month out from seeing the Pixel 6
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.300]   based on what my understanding is.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.900]   This is going to be a very expensive October,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.620]   because I'm looking for an about to upgrade.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.940]   And I need to get a new MacBook.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.580]   And so I'm like, oh, I know.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.020]   This fall is always a--
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.620]   so this is the-- we don't know the provenance of this,
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.940]   but this is the leaked video of what
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.420]   is not a release version of the phone, right?
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.340]   This is a manufacturing prototype
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.980]   to show a test, I think.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.020]   But yeah, shiny back.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.100]   There's that big-- I mean, talk about camera bump.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.860]   Google's embracing the camera bump.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.360]   So--
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.340]   I was about to say, at least they made it interesting.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.180]   Yeah, and I think it's also saying--
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.980]   because they didn't do anything with the camera last year.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.740]   That's why I stuck with the Pixel 4.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.060]   I didn't get a 5.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.060]   They're saying, I think, not so subliminally,
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.900]   pay attention to the camera because we're
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.140]   going to update this one.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.260]   So that's what I mean when I say people are even Apple fans
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.500]   are waiting to see what Google does with the Pixel 6.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.540]   Because they're the kings of computational photography,
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.260]   I would say.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:14.980]   Really?
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.460]   Really even Apple fans?
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.100]   I think even Apple fans-- you know,
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.380]   Mary Joe Foley was saying-- well, she's no Apple fan,
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.860]   but she said fans, not sheeple.
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.620]   I think everybody--
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.980]   even Andy and Naco even on Mac Break Weekly, Renee Ritchie
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.540]   said he's going to get a Pixel 6.
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.260]   I think people understand that when Google flexes, not
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.580]   when they're taking the year off like they did last year,
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.860]   but when they're really pushing the envelope,
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.100]   there is nobody better.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.980]   Now, Mark LeVoy, who was the king of all of that--
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.380]   remember when Mark LeVoy did get his amazing talk to Google
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:48.380]   I/O--
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.980]   He was the goby, I believe.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.580]   Yeah, he left and went to Adobe to work on their software.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.460]   But he was the king of computational.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.740]   He was the only good thing in that Google I/O keynote
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.900]   two years ago.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.180]   But he was great.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.860]   And I think Google really has a lot of scientists working
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.100]   on getting better images.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.140]   And so I think we all want to see what Google does
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.700]   with the Pixel 6, don't you?
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.220]   I do.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.860]   Yes, I've got my money ready.
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.420]   Yeah, I think a lot of us are standing there.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.380]   Take my money.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.140]   The Pixel 6--
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.140]   I've got sales money ready.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.180]   Jason, I like your strategy.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.940]   If you go to the Chelsea, New York Chelsea store,
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:37.660]   you can see apparently, see a Pixel 6 in the window.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.860]   Yeah, the window.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.340]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.180]   So there it is.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:40.580]   You know what?
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.540]   That's a nice back of that shiny, creamy,
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.820]   looks like ivory almost back.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.180]   Is it tri-color?
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.580]   Yeah, it's not a pink color.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.700]   Yeah, it's a little kind of peach top.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.380]   The black bar where the camera bump is,
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.860]   goes all the way across.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.540]   They're so proud of the camera bump.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.340]   They've lined it in metal so you don't miss it.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.300]   And then that creamy body.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.700]   I think this is a signature.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.940]   Yeah, it's a total signature of this device.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.420]   And I really like what Google's doing and continues
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.180]   to do as far as their marketing.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.020]   They had said earlier this year, I mean, even a couple
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.220]   of months ago, that the push for Pixel 6
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.140]   was going to be their biggest hardware marketing
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.940]   effort for one of their phones.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.740]   So we expect that Google's going to go big and go all out
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.380]   for this.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.180]   But we're seeing all this push, billboards, promo videos,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.620]   this thing in New York City.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.860]   And it's coming out like a snowball, it's building.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.620]   We're seeing all this before they've even officially
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.420]   announced that the release date or anything like that.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.780]   I don't know, I like this approach that Google's taking
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.500]   because it really does put the power into their hands.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.860]   It doesn't stop any of the leaks as you just showed.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.140]   There's somebody who has the hands on video of it.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.980]   But at least gives them a little bit more control over it
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.300]   instead of letting just the fan base go wild with it
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.380]   and make all sorts of assumptions.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.380]   It's kind of just--
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.900]   There was a suspicious DHL delivery from Mountain View,
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.580]   California that led to that leaks, sir.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.340]   That's all I'll say about that.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.540]   Oh, well, say more.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.460]   That may be all you're going to say about that,
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.220]   but I really want to know more.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.900]   I still think Google's behind these leaks.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.900]   Ah.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.300]   Well, they might as well lean into it
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.340]   because it's going to happen anyway.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.700]   So who leaked it? Was that a reputable place?
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.380]   Mountain View is where Google is.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.380]   Is what it is.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.540]   No, I'm in--
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.740]   So who posts of the video?
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.020]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.980]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   I don't know who the source of the hands-on video is.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.940]   These last few years have been these random YouTube
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.380]   resorts content creators.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.500]   Yeah, because those people--
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.220]   I mean, you would go on and-- sorry.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.060]   I think that there's some help from Google itself,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.940]   especially when they're--
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.620]   I want to say the last two were channels that were in Asia
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.860]   somewhere or based in Asia.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.140]   So they have access.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:03.740]   OK.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.100]   Well, the video that I showed on Twitter,
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.020]   the symbol on the back is not the G. That's a test symbol.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.260]   So that was a manufacturing test.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.620]   These are pictures from the Google store in New York.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.700]   These are real.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.220]   Oh, and you can hear that.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.860]   So there's one with two cameras,
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.580]   and there's one with three, as you can see.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.580]   That's kind of the new thing.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.340]   Apple's got three of its pros.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.900]   And what they tend to be is an ultra-wide, wide,
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.340]   and normal, or long.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:34.860]   Like a toner.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.700]   Yeah, in fact, one of the reasons-- the only reason
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.780]   I would consider getting the new iPhone is it's a 77 millimeter
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.220]   effective for the phone.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.140]   For the perfect photo.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.340]   That's just right for portrait.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.780]   Yep.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.580]   Also, let's talk about colors, because they are two-tone.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.860]   The one on the bottom has an orange top.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.140]   And I guess pink on the bottom.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.820]   Then there's cream and buff.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.620]   So they are kind of subtly two-toned.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.060]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:01.980]   I couldn't work those.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.780]   Yeah, I think they're pretty.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.100]   So these are close-ups of the phone floating in space
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.140]   in the store.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.460]   I like that orange.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.460]   What do you think?
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.020]   I like it.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.340]   I like the orange, too.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.220]   The problem is the orange is only on the 6,
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.580]   and not the 6 Pro from my understanding.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.580]   Oh, I want the Pro.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.980]   So you're getting the 6 Pro.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.580]   The 6 Pro seems to have more muted color choices than the 6,
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.980]   and I think that's too bad, because I
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.420]   like the boldness of some of these colors.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.740]   So the Google styling reminds me,
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.620]   and I'm going to bring this back to fashion for a hot second,
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.980]   what Catherine Han wore at the Emmys.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.460]   What did Catherine Han wore at the Emmys?
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.260]   So you got to check out--
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.380]   Was she the one in the bathing cap in the rubber gloves?
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.820]   No, she wore Lave.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.220]   I can't ever say it.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.820]   But it's a giant-- it's a black thing
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.180]   with this giant fat belt.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.140]   The second I saw that, I was like, oh my god,
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.420]   she's like the Pixel 6.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.620]   My husband was like, you are such a nerd.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.020]   Well, wait a minute now.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.340]   We've got to take a look.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.540]   Oh, it is a big belt.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.940]   Oh my god.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.420]   The enormous, chunky belt.
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.380]   Here we are.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.460]   Look at the size of that thing.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.180]   I don't know what that reminds me of.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.100]   You're never going to be able to see that and the Pixel
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.260]   6 together again.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.140]   Oh, I love Catherine Han.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.420]   I know who you mean now.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.580]   Yeah, she was--
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.460]   It's hilarious.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.460]   Agatha.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.460]   She was Agatha in the WandaVision show.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.020]   I guess that's what she was nominated for.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.620]   But she also did a wonderful miniseries on HBO,
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.820]   where she played-- well, I can't remember the name of it,
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.500]   so I guess I'll stop.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.260]   But nice.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.260]   I like the big buckles.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.740]   I like the big buckles.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.820]   She looks like she's a tiny, tiny person
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.180]   with a watch band around her.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.180]   Exactly.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.900]   That's what this makes me--
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.300]   I know that's silly, but we talked about fashion.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.220]   I'm going to start making it a regular thing in there.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.220]   OK.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.780]   Stacy is fashion update.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.820]   And then people are going to say--
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.900]   Fashion moment of the day.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.540]   Leo, you're so sexist.
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.740]   Why do you make the woman do the fashion update?
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.540]   You know.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.700]   Because that's going to happen.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.300]   Yeah, and then you're just telling me,
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.100]   because Aunt couldn't do it.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.100]   Aunt wanted to.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.260]   We did them, clearly.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.100]   I wanted Aunt to do it.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.860]   So the other rumor that is very interesting--
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.300]   we talked about this last week.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.420]   The jumbo check was jumbo--
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.420]   What a name.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.580]   Oh, the code name for a folding phone
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.980]   that apparently Google plans to announce next month.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.140]   What do you think, Jason?
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.940]   What's the all about Android take on that?
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.380]   I mean, I don't know that it's necessarily next month.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.380]   I don't know that we have that definitively,
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.900]   but the sources or the people who are coming out and saying,
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.180]   yeah, this is happening or saying by the end of the year,
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.060]   we will have this.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.540]   So I mean, on one hand, it makes sense
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.460]   that it would be next month.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.660]   On the other hand, we've seen absolutely no leaks
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.660]   outside of like little bits of information.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.780]   I just don't trust that Google is that good at keeping
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.500]   a secret like this.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.020]   Keeping--
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.580]   Why would you announce Pixel 6 in October?
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.740]   And then two months later, announce a jumbo jack.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.180]   You're right.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.300]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.380]   It would absolutely not make sense for them
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.740]   to have an announcement slash release in December,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.940]   because they're going to want to capitalize on the Christmas--
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.380]   the Christmas shopping season.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.860]   So I don't know.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.060]   Apple does the thing where they do the phone right now,
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.100]   and then a few weeks later, they do another hardware
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:28.820]   announcement, right?
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.540]   Maybe Google didn't take--
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.620]   Microsoft did the same thing.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.540]   A page out of Apple.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.900]   So I'm going to go on record saying,
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.580]   this is one of those rumors where somebody's got it wrong
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.500]   or somebody saw something in the lab,
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.580]   but Google has no intention of releasing it.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.980]   Here's Eve Leakes.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.260]   Evan Blass' tweet heard from somebody.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.100]   I trust that the foldable Pixel code name
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.540]   passport retail branding unknown will indeed
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.660]   launch before the end of the year.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.540]   Apparently, they've been working on this device for over two
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.580]   years.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.980]   And if the P6 is any indication, it'll be worth a look.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.460]   You know what?
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.940]   I would say, OK, let me just devil's advocate here,
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.060]   not in the jerky way, but in the just throwing--
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.180]   Me in the way I do it.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.180]   Go ahead.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.060]   Do it in Stacy style.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.620]   I hate when people say that you're
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.660]   going to say something really offensive.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.060]   Let me play devil's advocate.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.820]   But you smell like a ripe orange.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.820]   Now go ahead.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.980]   I don't know what that means.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.420]   But people who spend crazy money on these folding phones,
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.500]   I feel like they're early adopters, they're tech nerds.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.900]   Google will probably have a replacement, not a replay--
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.620]   a trade-in type of program.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.340]   And they're people like you, Leo, who are like, hey,
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.060]   I'm going to buy six different phones this year,
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.140]   because I want to see what's happening everywhere.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.260]   So I don't think they're releasing this
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.180]   with the expectation that it's going to be their number one
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.700]   selling phone.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.140]   I think they're releasing it as a launch
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.820]   that we're in the folding space.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.220]   Here's our vision.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.780]   And then next year, you'll see something probably more mainstream.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.460]   Does that make sense?
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.700]   I think that's totally plausible.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.420]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:01.820]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.380]   Could be.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.180]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.220]   According to Tom's Guide, the date is October 19.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.460]   So we'll find out not too far from now, three weeks.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.380]   I cannot wait.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.300]   That's the thing.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:18.060]   I mean, I'm honestly thinking even Apple fans are saying, well,
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.820]   yeah, I'm going to have to get an iPhone,
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.980]   because I'm in the iPhone universe.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.100]   But I really am curious what the Pixel 6 is capable of.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.220]   Apple certainly said a high bar.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.220]   The low light photography in the new iPhone 13s
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.620]   are from all the images I've seen.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.860]   The reviews came out yesterday.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.100]   And the images are spectacular in low light.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.820]   Just amazing.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.460]   So we'll see.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.300]   We'll see.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.260]   Hey, all I could say, it's a good time to be buying a phone.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:44.980]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.540]   It's a bad time to be a phone reviewer,
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.260]   because you've got a lot of phones to buy.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.820]   It's hardware season right now.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.980]   See, it's hard out here for hardware review.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.660]   It's hard out here.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.420]   That's what from your brown, Mr. Howell.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.700]   It's OK.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.500]   I'm doing my best to keep up with you.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.580]   Hang in there, sir.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.700]   My thumbs have RSI injuries.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.540]   Hey, let's take a little break.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.740]   We've got lots more to talk about.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.460]   Thank you, Jason House, filling in for Jeff Jarvis, who is--
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.940]   is he traveling--
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.020]   Jason, what's the word?
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.020]   He's easy.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.020]   That's a good question.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.020]   I can't remember.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.180]   He's totally used out.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.380]   And Stacy, you're going to be out next week.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.260]   It's actually the third team.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:24.780]   Oh, OK.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:25.340]   Am I out next week?
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.020]   Jason, did I say I was out next week?
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.620]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.020]   You're not out next week.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.580]   Jason knows all.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.820]   I will step in here and say, no, it's not next week.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.500]   It's the week after the sixth of October.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.060]   No, no, no, no.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.540]   Did I say the sixth?
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.140]   That's what you said in the email.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.500]   Oh, it's the 13th.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.940]   No.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.380]   It's the 13th.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.740]   OK.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:47.940]   I'll fix it.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.940]   I'll fix it.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.440]   Jason.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.780]   So I'm already putting it in the dark.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.780]   It's not a big deal.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.220]   Not a big deal.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.020]   My parents are coming in town.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.860]   And so y'all are fun and all, but I've got to hang with my folks.
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:59.860]   Got to do it.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.540]   So anyway, Jason's here for Jeff Jarvis.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.780]   And for it's also here's Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.020]   She's not sure if she's here, but she might be here.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.060]   She thinks she's here.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.900]   It's probably next week.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.380]   She's not here.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.900]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.900]   It's the 13th.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.060]   So it's good to have all three of you.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:19.220]   Our show today brought to you by a brand new podcast from Red Hat
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.060]   called Compiler.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.940]   Actually, Red Hat's some really good podcasts.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.420]   I was thinking of their other show,
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.260]   but I want you to listen to this new one.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.020]   Red Hat does the Command Line Hero Show, which is now in its new season.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.660]   This is the first season for Compiler.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.740]   Angela Andrews, Brent Seminole, hosted.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.340]   They're great, by the way.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.020]   And I love what they're doing, which is taking the questions
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.540]   from the internal messaging at Red Hat.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.380]   Things people are talking about on--
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.220]   I don't want to say--
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.340]   I don't know if it's Slack or Mattermost or whatever they're using.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.500]   But the things people are talking about and then turning them into podcasts,
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.500]   it's really, really good.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.140]   They're short, sweet, interesting.
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.660]   I just listened to the first episode.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.580]   They're all about 20 minutes long.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.700]   Should managers code?
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.620]   Should managers code?
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.700]   So this was a hot topic on their internal message board.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.100]   So they decided, let's do an episode where we ask people at Red Hat
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.860]   what they think.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.340]   They talked to the CFO.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.900]   She said, no, absolutely.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.700]   Not once you're a manager, you've got to avoid getting sucked in
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.540]   by your coders and your direct reports
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.620]   and writing the code yourself, just like a parent should never
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.140]   do the chores for their kids.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.140]   You've got to manage.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:37.260]   And then we heard from another manager who loves coding so much
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.180]   that he's been doing the advent of code because he misses it.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.700]   He's doing coding problems.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.820]   And then another manager said, no, no, no.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.060]   You've got to keep your chops up.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.260]   You've got to code.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.500]   It's an interesting debate.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.980]   Should managers code?
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.820]   That was just episode one.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.740]   They have many, many--
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.580]   I've stepped up four now, I think.
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.820]   The most recent, do we want a world without technical debt?
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.740]   That's a very interesting topic.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   They go deep.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:06.020]   You'd be amazed how much you can get into 20 minutes, which
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.780]   makes me wonder why we go so long.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:13.540]   This is when everybody's going to want to listen to who's
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.580]   in the tech industry.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.940]   How do you interview for a technical position,
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.780]   red hatters who got through those technical interviews,
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.940]   often say the whiteboard interview is a terrible idea.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.580]   But on the other hand, there's some value to it.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.900]   If you're looking to get into tech,
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.940]   you'll be interested in episode three.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.940]   What are tech hiring managers looking for?
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.660]   Episode two, what can video games
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.020]   teach us about edge computing?
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:44.020]   Big topics, little topics, fascinating stuff.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.580]   Episodes are out now.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.420]   Just definitely subscribe.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.660]   The show is called Compiler.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.500]   C-O-M-P-I-L-E-R. You can listen to Compiler on Apple
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.940]   podcasts or anywhere you listen to podcasts.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.340]   We'll also include a link on the show page for this show.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.860]   So you can just go to twit.tv/twig and find that link there
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.500]   and go right to it.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.620]   I think it's a great show.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.060]   And I think Angela and Brent deserve a lot of credit
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.740]   for having put together a unique and interesting way
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.340]   of thinking about some of the big issues in tech.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:21.260]   Compiler podcasts learn more at red.ht/twit.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.820]   We thank Red Hat so much for their continuing support
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.420]   of our podcasts.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.380]   We're really glad to share the wealth
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.860]   and tell you about Compiler.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.580]   Let's see.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.300]   This is a product I will not buy.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.260]   You don't hear me say that very often.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.660]   I've heard you say that before.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:40.780]   It's totally false.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.220]   And then buy it.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.460]   This one I don't think I'd have any use for.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.980]   It's the new Facebook portal, which they're kind of turning
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:54.180]   into like an Echo Show or a Nest Hub.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.140]   The portal Go is $199.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:02.020]   There's also a portal plus for $349.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.740]   These are-- the Go actually has a charging dock.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.660]   So it's got battery.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.660]   You can carry it around a 10-inch screen, 1,200 by 800.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.580]   It can be used as a portable speaker.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.220]   But of course, the main point of these portal devices
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.980]   is for video conversations.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.100]   So and what's interesting-- and I didn't realize this.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.340]   I had the original portal.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.820]   It's out in the-- I keep trying to give it away.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.980]   I can't-- nobody wants it.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.420]   I don't notice it keeps getting closer and closer
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.380]   to the studio.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.940]   I put it at the front door, somebody put it away.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.860]   That's not-- I don't want Facebook in my house.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.500]   You know, I don't mind Amazon in my house.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.860]   I don't mind Google in my house.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.020]   Facebook has a road bridge too far.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.180]   The new portals do have built-in lens covers.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.820]   And there are buttons at the top that
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.300]   disconnect the camera and the microphone.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.740]   One of the things they did do very well in the original portal
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.780]   and they still do well-- it's a very high-res camera.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.900]   12 megapixels, but it's got an ultra-wide lens on it.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.500]   So what they can do is zoom in.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.740]   Everybody's starting to do this now.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.660]   Apple's starting to do it.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.100]   I know it works in my nest when I do a duo call.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.020]   They zoom in.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.580]   It's called Smart Camera Technology
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.460]   and it follows you around the room.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.540]   It pans and zooms to keep you in frame.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.940]   Apparently, the microphone and the speakers in this
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.860]   also do something similar.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.820]   So as you move around, your callers can still hear you
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.220]   clearly.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.060]   And more importantly, maybe, because this is obviously
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.660]   designed for Facebook Messenger and Messenger video,
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.500]   they're also adding support for other video conferencing
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.420]   technologies, which makes this a little bit more desirable,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.940]   including Zoom.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.700]   Let me see if they do Google Meet.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.620]   It's not for you, but it's shaping out to be a nice product.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.540]   Yeah, go to meeting, blue jeans, WebEx, and Zoom.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.780]   It looks like they're trying to get this into small businesses
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.380]   more than people.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.980]   Because they have the pro version that's
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.820]   a little more expensive and fancier.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.260]   So I wonder--
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:00.900]   That's a true sign.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.940]   Again, if I were a business, but I don't know.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.540]   $349 for that.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.660]   That's for the pro.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.540]   Yes.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.780]   And so this is--
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.900]   I haven't had any firsthand experience with these devices.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.540]   It is primarily video conferencing,
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.700]   because I'm used to seeing these kinds of devices
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.860]   in Google's Nest Hub.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.300]   Yeah, you can video conference on it.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.900]   But it's also an assistant portal--
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.300]   a portal, no reference in the card.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.300]   But yeah, I mean, it does all these other things.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.780]   Is this primarily just like--
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.580]   --it's a clock on your home screen and then--
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.060]   It's got a calendar.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:34.540]   OK.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.740]   Yeah, it's mostly for video calling.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.860]   I mean, it's an interface to Facebook.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.620]   If you're in a Facebook group, you can use it for that.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.620]   Messenger rooms.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.820]   There's Spotify.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.820]   So you can play music on it.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.860]   But yeah, I completely agree with you.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.620]   I don't know why you would prefer--
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.940]   unless you're all in the Facebook ecosystem,
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.620]   seems like a Nest Hub would be much better.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.700]   Or an Eko show would be much better.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.340]   So the Eko show--
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.700]   they have the Eko Show 10, which is the one that actually
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.260]   has the rotating body that the original portal has.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.740]   That's so weird.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.940]   That's $250.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.260]   The original portal did not do the same thing.
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.180]   It did not move.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.140]   The Eko Show has a servo that moves the camera around.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.460]   Yeah, the portal--
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.740]   It was that same thing.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.820]   It was super wide and it would without following you.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.060]   Oh, I don't care about that.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.260]   OK.
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.940]   So I think there's actually a really interesting thing
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.460]   happening.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:31.660]   So if you look at iOS 15, 15, one of the things that's now out,
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.060]   I believe, is you can send me web links to your FaceTime
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.180]   calls, and I can get them on my Pixel, which is something
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.020]   that they promised and never delivered.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.740]   So I think there's a big rush right now,
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.220]   for obvious reasons, to get into accessible video calling
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.020]   for everyone, and to have a dog in that hunt.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.140]   And so I think it makes sense that Facebook's adding more
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.620]   to this, even if it doesn't really make sense
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.140]   that Facebook would want to have this device.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.820]   So--
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.460]   Well, if you're a business--
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:03.940]   OK.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.580]   And you use WebEx or Zoom, which most businesses do, right?
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.620]   Or go to meeting.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.980]   Your calendar's on the screen.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.140]   You tap it.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.420]   The portal plus has a 14-inch screen.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.940]   It's a very big screen.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.580]   So you could even have it in a conference room, I think,
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.260]   and tap it.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.860]   And now you're in a video conference.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.460]   I could see why you might add that.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.340]   But again, if I'm a business, just the name Facebook on the front
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.780]   is going to turn me off, I think.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.660]   Well, I don't know.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.420]   Some businesses may feel that way.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.260]   But a lot of people, that's how they drive their businesses,
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.260]   the Facebook platform.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.860]   A lot of normal mom and pop shops.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.500]   I mean, I can't tell you how many times I go to a local store
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.700]   and I go to their website.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.380]   And it's basically--
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.020]   Right, in a space book.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.300]   --like this on Facebook.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.940]   And you're like, [GRUNTS]
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.940]   [GRUNTS]
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.940]   OK, well.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.380]   Sorry, that was a little excessive there.
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.380]   [GRUNTS]
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.180]   I'm not a fan of it, but that's the reality.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.180]   They must sell them because they get work items.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:07.860]   It's funny.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.020]   That's my good friend.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.500]   That's my curiosity.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.860]   He's now retired.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.700]   But his bulk of business came from Facebook referrals.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.460]   He was doing computer repair stuff.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.340]   And he did it for several years.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.220]   And yeah, he had a website.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.980]   He understood the value of the website
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.780]   and proper SEO and things of that nature.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.100]   But Facebook was his jam.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.180]   And he tried to get me on it years ago
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.340]   and did nothing for me.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.060]   But it works for him, so I've had it, brother.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.980]   Amazon has announced a new Kindle lineup.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.420]   Just, you know, you could thank me
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.380]   because I just bought a Kobo.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.940]   And of course, Amazon immediately
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.900]   announced the new Paperwhites 6.8 inch screen.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.740]   That's nice, although I got the Kobo with the 8 inch screen,
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.380]   so I want a little bit bigger screen.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.260]   USB-C, I'm very jealous because that is a much better way
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.820]   to charge.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.300]   They've had-- to now it's been that horrible micro USB.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.940]   That's the only thing I charge on a micro USB now.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.900]   I know.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.700]   So it's time--
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.540]   I've got one charger.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.660]   Time they did that.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.780]   Two-year worry-free guarantee warranty.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.820]   You could pre-order today ships on October 27.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:26.660]   I guess that's the whole thing.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.540]   The Paperwhite has a really good screen.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.660]   I have one of those.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.940]   I also have an Oasis.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.020]   So I'm kind of a Kindle fan.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:37.420]   That's why I thought I'd try it with a Kobo.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.980]   Add supported version, $139.99.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.780]   You just get an add on the start screen.
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.100]   It's not pretty green.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.860]   I kind of love the ads on my Amazon.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.340]   I don't mind it.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.220]   My husband.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.380]   Like, I thought I would hate it.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.420]   They're the cheesiest freaking books.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.580]   I love it.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.260]   She's a Navy Seal.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.620]   She's a Scottish heiress together.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.900]   They're forced to work and they hate each other.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.180]   Meet in another international foreign mystery romance.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.980]   They're going to fall in love.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.220]   Exactly.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.460]   It's waterproof, which I think is a nice feature.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.260]   That's why I got the Kobo because I could take a bath with it.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.740]   And you get four months of Kindle Unlimited for free
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.100]   when you purchase it.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.420]   With ads, $160.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.340]   The Signature Edition has more storage.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.260]   Kindle Paperwhite 8GB, Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.100]   has 32GB.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.260]   And that, by the way, is a massive amount of storage for eBooks.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:32.860]   For eBooks.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.580]   I mean, unless you're doing graphic novels?
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.660]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.220]   I think I have like 2,000 books on my Kindle.
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.500]   I am nowhere near the storage cap.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.780]   I just-- the only reason I wanted to try the Kobo, which
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.420]   is, by the way, owned by Rakuten now.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:49.940]   That's right.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:56.020]   Which is a little odd, is because I was very interested in the fact
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:03.020]   that it supports Overdrive, which is the library software
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.860]   that a lot of public libraries use.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.980]   I was able to sign up with the Sonoma County Library online.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.260]   And you have to go into the library.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.220]   I'll never see a library.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.780]   And I can get books and audio books free.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.820]   They're just like library books.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.500]   So you have to send them back.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.300]   They return automatically after a period of time.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   And you have to wait a while.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.140]   You can manage that all through the Kobo itself,
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.580]   because I use an app called Libby.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.100]   Right.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.620]   Yeah, it was going to say kind of thing.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.020]   But then I have to send it through and sending it
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.180]   through to my Kindle.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.540]   Sometimes it involves me then logging into my Amazon account
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.860]   on my phone.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.060]   It's by no means like a single button device
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.780]   on the Kindle itself.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   So that would actually be pretty cool to have it
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.660]   integrated like that.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.180]   I'll give you a little review.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:53.420]   When it comes out, because that's what interested me on it.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.940]   Also the waterproof, although now the Kindle immediately
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.220]   after I ordered this came out with a waterproof version.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.180]   And it also does portrait as well as--
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.180]   I mean, landscape as well as portrait, which I think might
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:05.180]   be nice.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.980]   I'll always be interesting for novels and how--
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.940]   like I have a couple books that are terrible on the Kindle.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.300]   Right.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.260]   Like cookbooks?
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.780]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.860]   Anything with illustrations?
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.220]   I have some chess books.
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.700]   You know, when you're looking--
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.420]   studying chess in a book, there you
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.460]   have diagrams of the board.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.060]   And on some of them, the production
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.260]   is so screwed up that the diagram is just tiny.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.660]   And you can't zoom it.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.660]   It's not like you zoom.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.100]   So you're like, I eat this useless.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.860]   I can't even read it.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.100]   So we'll see.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.500]   Cobo-- you have to buy through the Cobo store
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.060]   if you want to buy books.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.540]   But it supports the library and it supports ePub.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.100]   And it supports Dropbox.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.780]   I put all my-- I have a lot of books
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:51.380]   that I bought from various publishers in ePub format,
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.420]   not the Kindle proprietary Kindle format.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.820]   So I could put those on here.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.420]   So that'll work out pretty well.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.540]   It's a little more expensive than the Amazon.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.020]   I think the Amazon is somewhat subsidized by Amazon itself.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:02.780]   Just a little bit.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.260]   Just a little bit.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.100]   Just a corner of the market on those eBooks.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:11.820]   I will say, if you want to feel angry at Amazon,
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.340]   look at what they're doing with libraries
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.980]   and Libby and the kerfuffle that's--
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.780]   What's going on?
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.140]   --the content that has Libby.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.420]   Well, as Libby has made it much easier for people
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.180]   to borrow eBooks from their library,
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.100]   Amazon is actually starting to make it--
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.060]   so some of the books that are published under their imprint,
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.180]   their eBooks published under their eBooks publishing
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.460]   imprint, don't go to libraries.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.380]   They're just like screw it.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.140]   We're not giving it to you.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   It's pretty--
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.860]   Oh, I don't mean what.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.700]   --I mean, the major publishers are already doing windowing
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:47.340]   and they're making shorter-- oh, there you go.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.380]   Yeah, this is a story from March.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.620]   Yeah, that's too bad.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.580]   You know, that's--
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.420]   it's kind of funny because we just
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.300]   have this long tradition of libraries
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.420]   buying a few copies of a book, keeping it in the library
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.580]   for people to get for free.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.140]   And I think the notion of free public library
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:11.060]   is definitely a societal good--
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.420]   --essential to the democracy.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.220]   I think so, because not everybody can't afford to buy a book.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.500]   When digital came along, it became a little bit more
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.100]   complicated.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.660]   So I'm looking on Overdrive, which
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.700]   is the software that Sonoma County Library uses.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.020]   And I wanted to read Isaac Asimov's Foundation.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.060]   I don't happen to have a copy.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.860]   I read it when I was in high school
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.140]   and it's coming out on Apple TV plus this month.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:36.820]   So I looked and I said, well, we have three copies
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.940]   and they're all out and it's a six month wait.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.500]   It's just exactly like the--
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   --the library.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.420]   They have a limited number, even though they're digital
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.100]   and they could in theory have infinite copies.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.860]   But that's how they've handled it,
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.060]   is to make it just like it's a real book.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.100]   I think that seems fair.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.100]   Well, fair.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.100]   So it does.
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.100]   OK, so the other part-- the other governing thing
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.340]   is they can only-- when they do this,
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.500]   there's two types of windowing.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.660]   When you buy a digital copy, you can only
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.060]   lend it out X number of times.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.500]   So then they have to buy a new copy.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   Because a real book would wear out out of--
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.220]   --because a real book would wear out after a book.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.460]   I'm just saying that that's part of the deal.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.660]   And then the other part is there's
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.300]   a time constraint on some of them now, too.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.220]   So this is a problem if you want it--
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.980]   like foundation, maybe not because it's super popular, right?
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.820]   People are always going to want to borrow that.
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.900]   But some books that are maybe less popular,
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.700]   they'll go out of the time limit for lending those books out,
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.940]   even if they haven't been--
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.420]   --a number limit.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:39.900]   And so I encounter this when I find--
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.860]   if you're looking for a new sci-fi trilogy, as I want to do,
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.140]   sometimes you'll be like, oh, there's a third, the second
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.660]   and third.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.580]   So where's the first?
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.340]   And then it'll be out of when it happens.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.260]   Oh, for us, too.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.060]   I mean, and then you can go to Amazon and buy it.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:48:00.220]   But I have to think that it doesn't really cost authors
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.060]   or publishers much to support libraries.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.340]   And there's such a benefit in society.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.820]   I would hope Amazon would rethink its stance.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.700]   I mean, it probably does cost some.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.100]   There's a loss of sales.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.820]   I read probably two to three books a week.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.300]   And so I wouldn't--
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:25.020]   I obviously would not buy that many books in my life.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.740]   But in I buy books by authors I like.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.420]   I buy books like new authors, especially diverse authors.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.300]   I'm trying really hard to spend actual money
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.060]   on buying their books.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:40.580]   But I do read more than if--
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.660]   because I have access-- very easy access to those books.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.820]   I still would go to the library and pick them up otherwise.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:49.580]   But I do think there's probably a overall loss in sales.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.820]   But I also do it because ebooks are really expensive
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.420]   for what I feel like I'm getting, right?
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.900]   Like, paying $12 for a digital copy of a book
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.500]   feels kind of like highway robbery sometimes.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:05.860]   Libraries also offer movies, digital for download,
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:06.940]   audio books for free.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.140]   You should check your local library
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.300]   and see what software they support.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.940]   I think it's Libby and Overdrive are the two biggest, right?
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.220]   You could read newspapers.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:16.380]   And it's free.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.340]   And I've seen snooze papers.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.380]   And if you go into the physical library,
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.580]   a lot of libraries are doing like CNC.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.740]   They have like little electronics making stations.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.580]   Some libraries have like sewing machines.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.740]   It's actually libraries are--
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.740]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.740]   That's so smart.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.740]   And it's not free.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.060]   We pay for it with our taxes.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.660]   I mean, you should use them because you're paying for them
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.900]   and you should value them.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:39.900]   Sorry.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.900]   I--
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.420]   Excellent.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.420]   My first job was in a library.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.380]   I was an intern at the library when I was 13 and 14.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.180]   I worked in a library in college.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.900]   It was one of my college jobs.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.900]   I did too.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.900]   And college?
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:51.900]   Aw.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:52.900]   I did--
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.900]   Library nerds.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.380]   I worked in a movie theater, OK?
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.060]   Well, you're more modern than the rest of us.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.060]   That's all.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.060]   Ooh, kid.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.060]   That's all.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.060]   Let's see.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:09.540]   It's too bad Jeff's not here because there's so many good
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.540]   Facebook stories.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.540]   Let's not talk about these Facebook stories.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.380]   Yes, let's just ignore them.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:16.940]   Let's just ignore them.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.780]   I'm happy to ignore them.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.500]   I feel like the last couple of weeks, especially, it's just been
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.740]   yeah, what other bad thing did Facebook supposedly do?
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.020]   And it's exhausting at a certain point.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.260]   And it doesn't impact me personally because I'm not on
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.300]   Facebook anymore.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.500]   But that's why I'm not interested.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.500]   I'm not interested.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.500]   Or WhatsApp?
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.500]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.780]   Because people are like, are you on WhatsApp or Instagram?
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.220]   Yes.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.420]   So you are on Facebook, eh?
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.620]   I feel like a lot of people are self-righteously like, I
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.300]   ditched my Facebook account five years ago because they're
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.300]   evil.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.300]   It's so true.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.300]   It's so true.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.180]   It's so really hypocritical that it plays to be.
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.780]   Why is there a difference then?
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.820]   Because I feel like there's a difference for me, there is.
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:02.820]   There is.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.620]   Because when I stepped away from Facebook, I did it for a
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.580]   very particular reason, which was that when I used Facebook,
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.180]   I didn't feel good.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:15.220]   Like I would read through my feed.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:19.300]   And this person that I know and love would suddenly get into a
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.260]   conversation with this person that I know and love that they
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.500]   didn't know and love each other.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.580]   And now suddenly they're yelling at each other about something
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.220]   that I'm just like, why?
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.460]   I don't want to be the reason that this happens.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:31.220]   And I don't want to read it because it makes me feel like
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:31.860]   crap.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:34.540]   And that's the main reason that I stepped away from Facebook.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.860]   And then all this other data privacy and all that other
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.860]   aspects came to light as well.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.220]   That added on to it.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.660]   But that was my primary reason.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.100]   OK.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.140]   Well, the big crisis--
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.980]   crisis, that is not the word.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.100]   The big issue from a governmental standpoint is
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.140]   Facebook, when they bought these companies, said they would
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.860]   not combine their back ends.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.180]   So for a while, actually cutting out Facebook and still
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.780]   being part of these was fine because they weren't sharing
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.100]   data, et cetera.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.340]   But Facebook then integrated those things.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:08.260]   And now they are basically the same company doing the same
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.220]   evil that Facebook is doing in some ways.
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.900]   And last week's story, we talked about Instagram does make
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.100]   people feel bad sometimes.
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.900]   So I know--
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.620]   I don't even-- as soon as I killed Facebook, it was like a
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.860]   burden lifted from my shoulders.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.980]   And I don't even care about Facebook news.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:31.820]   And obviously, I should because I am a minority that's left
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.460]   Facebook.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.940]   But to answer your question, I agree 100% with you, Jason.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.740]   The reason I left is because it didn't make me feel good.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.260]   I do have an Instagram account, but that's mostly just so
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.900]   that I can show Instagram here.
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.940]   Because if you don't have an account, Instagram really limits
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.460]   what you can do.
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.700]   You can't zoom in on the picture.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.220]   You can't do too many pictures.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.460]   So a lot of our hosts post stuff--
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.620]   I just posted a picture on Instagram.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.500]   And I just showed you.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.180]   But mostly, I don't.
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:00.180]   And I've never had a WhatsApp account.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.340]   So I kind of like not being in that Facebook universe.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:07.820]   Nevertheless, there is Facebook news.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.420]   The latest is the markup, which is publication at the
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.900]   markup.org nonprofit.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.740]   Has found evidence that Facebook is changing the news feed,
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.580]   actually changing the website code, to foil automated data
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.940]   collection of news feed posts.
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:29.540]   Groups like NYU's ad observatory scrape Facebook to keep an
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.820]   eye on what's happening at scale.
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.740]   You have to do this in an automated fashion.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.340]   So Facebook is doing this thing.
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.820]   It's really--
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.180]   it's blatant.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:47.980]   They're attaching junk code to accessibility features, which
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:51.740]   it breaks both browser-based ad blocking services, which
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.180]   may be the real reason they're doing it.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:57.780]   But also, it harms people who are visually impaired because
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:02.340]   the alt tags that they're looking to use are now full of
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.700]   crap.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.820]   And by adding these tags--
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.820]   they're actually in ARIA.
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.980]   They're in the ARIA tags.
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.060]   So you don't see it in the browser, but screen reader
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.340]   software uses--
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.140]   not the alt tags, it's the ARIA tags--
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.540]   screen reader software uses it.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:20.900]   But organizations like NYU's ad observatory also use it to
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.340]   identify sponsored posts.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:27.860]   So Facebook says, well, we constantly make code changes
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:31.180]   across our services, but we did not make any code changes to
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:34.620]   block these research projects, to which I'll add.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.300]   That was just a happy side effect.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:44.500]   Laura Edelson, who's a PhD candidate in computer science
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:48.300]   at NYU and the founder of the ad observatory project,
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:53.700]   said, express dismay at Facebook's move because it
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.380]   caused a sharp drop in the amount of data collected.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.580]   A fix was found that allowed the team to collect data at
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:54:59.540]   normal levels.
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.820]   She said, I think it's unfortunate that Facebook has
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.660]   continued to fight with researchers rather than work
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:04.940]   with them.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.580]   And that's kind of a constant drum beat in the last few
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:07.860]   weeks.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.660]   We've talked about that last week, which is that Facebook
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:14.580]   doesn't really want researchers to pay attention to see into
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.020]   what Facebook's doing.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.220]   And I think we agreed last week that something Facebook
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:24.220]   has to allow, because we can't trust them to a self-report.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.820]   They need to have-- allow researchers to keep an eye on
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:29.900]   things, not to bust Facebook, but to see what's going on.
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:36.980]   But again, it still turns into, hey, are you trying to
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.700]   regulate me with Facebook?
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:39.700]   Don't regulate us.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:40.540]   And it's their platform.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:44.980]   It's their platform.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.700]   What can you say?
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:56.140]   Six takeaways from Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.100]   From this week's Work with Event.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:02.100]   What was the works with event, Stacey?
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.820]   Oh, that's surprising.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.900]   OK.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.700]   That was a--
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.180]   I was like, hi, I know that's like.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.940]   IoT conference hosted last week by Silicon Labs.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.900]   And they're a chip company that makes all the underlying
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:17.300]   radios.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.660]   I put you to sleep with a Facebook story, didn't I?
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.780]   You totally did.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:21.500]   No, I just--
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.300]   What?
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.620]   I was just like, what?
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:25.820]   I changed the subject.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.020]   I was so bored.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:27.620]   I changed the subject.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.700]   I was expecting something totally different.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.700]   I thought we were going to talk about Google.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.260]   Oh, we will.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.860]   I'm saving the best for last.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.140]   OK.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:37.140]   Hey.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.500]   No, no, I'm saving the best for first.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:45.740]   Let me bring you a shovel there, Leo.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:48.580]   I cannot help doing this with you, Stacey.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.700]   I don't know why.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.460]   Wow.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:51.980]   OK.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.340]   Must be brilliant.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.140]   OK, go ahead.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.500]   It's all good.
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.340]   OK, so the six takeaways.
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.340]   The ones you almost care about.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.100]   There was actually-- this is so nerdy,
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.700]   but I'm going to do it because security is so important.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:08.060]   Silicon Labs announced their custom parts manufacturing
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:08.580]   something.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.900]   I don't have the story in front of me.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:10.620]   Oh, I do.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:10.980]   I can read it to you.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.020]   Like a second bullet point.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:12.340]   What does it--
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:15.020]   Custom part manufacturing service.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.580]   CPMF, S.
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.060]   So this is a big deal.
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.860]   What they're doing is if you are a client of their chips,
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.820]   you can log in through a web portal
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:26.780]   and they attach individual device
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:31.020]   IDs to your individual chips at manufacturer.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:32.220]   This is going to help with things
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.980]   like preventing counterfeiting.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.700]   This is going to help with--
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.500]   you can actually occlude who makes your chips.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.980]   So you could actually, if you're doing components for Apple,
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.500]   normally your chip says your name on it,
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.620]   but you could actually have--
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:47.100]   or Silicon Labs name on it, but you could actually
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:51.380]   have it say something else to help hide who made that part.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.660]   And from a security standpoint, it's awesome
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.980]   because it is going to ensure the supply chain
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.860]   from the very beginning of the supply chain.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.020]   No one else is going to be able to tamper with that chip.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.340]   All the certificates, all the IDs,
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.740]   all of that's going to be implanted individually
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.140]   on the chip, not at a batch level,
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:11.060]   but on each individual chip at manufacturer.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.260]   It's freaking awesome.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.020]   And no one else is doing this.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.340]   And it's something I've actually talked with.
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.180]   The California has a law.
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.980]   And for a while, the chip manufacturers
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.660]   were worried that they were going to have to do this.
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:24.820]   Like, oh, god, it's going to be so expensive.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.580]   And it turns out that they kind of punt it and we're like,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.420]   yeah, we don't need to secure everything
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.780]   at the individual device level.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.140]   But it is a best practice.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.580]   And Silicon Labs is pushing this forward.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.220]   Their people have to pay for it.
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.500]   Their customers have to pay for it.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.500]   But they should because it's going to be a big deal.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.980]   I think we're going to see more of that happening.
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.860]   Do they make a lot of the chips in IoT devices?
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:47.260]   They do.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.140]   They make a lot of--
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.740]   so they're the only people right now who make ZIG-B chips--
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:52.620]   sorry, Z-Wave chips.
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.540]   Oh, OK.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:57.700]   They are only-- they divested themselves
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.220]   to their automotive industry business earlier this year.
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.380]   They sold it for like $3 billion to go all in on IoT.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.060]   So they make Wi-Fi chips--
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.340]   ZIG-B, Z-Wave.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.380]   They're big behind the matter standard.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.540]   They make thread radios.
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:14.420]   They make a lot of sub-gigher-hertz chips.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:17.540]   So for like, Wysun, Laura, Amazon Sidewalk,
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.020]   they make the chips there.
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.020]   So there's tons.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:20.540]   Oh, god.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:23.140]   They're big in a lot of the maker space,
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.700]   a lot of the little gadgets and things
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.220]   that the maker community puts together,
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.420]   just for hobby robots and things like that.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.340]   Maybe-- I mean, I always associate that with--
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.340]   Zoos, I've seen you.
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.740]   --because there's a Broadcom chip in the pie.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:36.660]   But sure.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.100]   I mean, they make radio-- they're big businesses radios.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.220]   They have microcontrollers and stuff
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:44.660]   that help control the radios, and they do some modules.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.060]   But their big thing is just radios.
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:47.660]   Gotcha.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:48.460]   Bluetooth radios.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.460]   I forgot Bluetooth.
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.780]   But they make those too.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:54.540]   Anyway, so I love them because they're great for IoT.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.380]   You can see all sorts of cool things happening.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.740]   So in one of those is like sub-gigher-hertz radios
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.700]   being a big deal.
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.140]   I don't know what the other takeaways are.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.580]   I cannot remember.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:07.660]   See, it's so fascinating because probably most of our listeners
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.620]   have never heard of silicon labs.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.780]   And yet, probably all of our listeners
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.980]   have devices with silicon labs chips in them.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.460]   Oh, you 100% do.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.820]   They're inside phones.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.620]   They're inside like--
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.620]   Everything.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.460]   They're messed up.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.780]   Yeah, they're everywhere.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:25.180]   And so-- and many of these devices
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.500]   are insecure or potentially insecure.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:32.780]   So this isn't actually much more important than we realize.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.860]   So you see a lot of the Bluetooth attacks.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.940]   Some of them rely--
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:43.180]   there are a few supply chain attacks on radios that matter.
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.900]   But ultimately, I think this is a good example
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.780]   of someone in the industry stepping up in offering
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.260]   a service that is needed, not just on radios,
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.580]   but for everything.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.100]   And I think other companies will follow through with it
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.380]   or follow on with this and offer the same thing
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.580]   once they see it's possible and people buy it.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:09.220]   You hosted a panel on medical IoT?
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:10.500]   Yeah, medical devices.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.380]   Devices.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:16.060]   Yeah, for like how IoT is changing the medical industry.
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.060]   Interesting.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.060]   Which is COVID world.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.380]   Are they going to put one in my chest?
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.940]   Is that a IoT place for IoT?
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:26.420]   I wouldn't do that just yet, to be honest.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.260]   And if I did, I would make sure the radio was manufactured
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.500]   with the custom parts manufacturing service.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.500]   From Sherlock and Labs, yeah.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.500]   Just because--
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.020]   I just did something-- Lisa, I just
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.860]   did something on Monday that I'm--
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:41.700]   Kevin Rose told me about and recommended.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.180]   And now I have some--
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.940]   a little bit of misgiving, speaking of medical procedures.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.420]   We did a-- we both did a full body MRI scan.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.180]   Scan.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:50.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.780]   This is the company's pre-newvo.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:57.660]   And doctors think this is a terrible idea.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.660]   I'm sure.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.260]   I was going to say, do you know that's the joke every doctor
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:01.620]   makes?
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.300]   They're like, oh, yeah, put them through an MRI scan
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.900]   and see everything wrong with it.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.620]   Like 98% of the stuff is totally--
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.100]   It's nothing.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.260]   That's the problem is-- and if you see a spot on somebody's
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.300]   lung, you can't ignore it.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.300]   Even though most of the time it's meaningless.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.260]   So I'm now-- I have some misgivings.
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:22.620]   I haven't yet seen this result of the scans.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.820]   But I listened to Kevin.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:25.860]   We did it for a good reason.
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.220]   Lisa's had a chronic issue that's been bugging the hell out
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:28.860]   of her.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.900]   It's not life-threatening.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.460]   But she wants to get it solved.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.300]   And so I did it kind of as a supportive spouse.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.860]   I said, well, let's do it together.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.660]   But also because I'm of an age where
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.220]   if they can spot cancer at an early stage,
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.180]   it'd probably be a good thing.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.180]   But then I read up on it and doctors say, no, no, you should
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.340]   never do this because you're going to see stuff that's not
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.460]   consequential, but you can't ignore now that you know it.
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.460]   That's what--
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.580]   What is that liver spot, that mass you have in your liver
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:58.940]   there?
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.380]   Is that anything to be concerned about?
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.140]   Oh, probably not.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.460]   Let's just ignore it.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.860]   No, that was just that rib eye.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:07.300]   Probably.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.860]   Anyway, you made me think of it when--
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.140]   have you ever done an MRI?
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.780]   Holy cow.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.660]   I love them.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.100]   Do you love them?
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:15.780]   You love them?
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.700]   Best sleep I've ever had in my life was the two times I've
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.220]   had MRIs.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.180]   So interesting.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.140]   Did they do your whole body?
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.100]   So a whole body, it's an hour.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.580]   You're in there for a long time.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.020]   No, it was maybe half an hour for me from my--
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.700]   If they're looking at a bone injury or something,
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.580]   they'll just do that region.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.180]   The thing is noisy as hell.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:35.780]   I asked them.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.180]   They said, that's just a side effect.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:37.700]   That was a great white noise.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.460]   Pumping so much energy through your body
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.900]   that the metal and everything creaks and molds.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.460]   It's-- really?
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:46.860]   Really?
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.980]   So that's the metal responding to the energy
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.300]   that's coming through my body.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.620]   Wow.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.420]   It got--
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.940]   We were at the magnet rotated.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.700]   Well, some of it's positioning.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:02.020]   But there's also quite a bit of a metal stress noise.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.580]   There's clanking and clonking--
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.420]   [SINGING]
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.220]   It was like the best white noise for me.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.540]   And then they swatted you up like a newborn baby.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.420]   Oh, you're in a tube.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.820]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.100]   I look forward to it.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.500]   It was out of here.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.140]   You are so funny.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.420]   Well, I didn't-- I mean, I know people who freak.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.220]   They ask you, are you claustrophobic?
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.940]   Because I mean, you're in a pretty small tube.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:32.180]   But I was pleased that it didn't scare me.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.980]   And I did kind of nap towards the end.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.140]   But--
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:35.980]   Because it's boring.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:37.860]   They do VR headsets for them.
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:41.380]   There's a whole study of people doing VR to help with the--
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:42.860]   I thought it was so close.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.500]   It felt--
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.380]   I felt like I was in a science fiction movie.
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:51.780]   It's just brightly lit white room with technicians.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.540]   They're all hooded up and stuff.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:56.060]   And you get in this machine, and it's going--
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.660]   [SINGING]
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.980]   It felt very cold.
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:04:59.620]   It's cold.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.940]   There's wind blowing on you.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.140]   It's very science-- you feel like you're in a sci-fi movie.
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:04.660]   Anyway.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.660]   It's like Bailey and probing machine.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.020]   I don't know how you sleep through that.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.460]   It's not like that's a constant noise.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.380]   No, it's not--
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:18.060]   It's like random lips or bleeps of all the frequency--
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.060]   I don't know.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   I know.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.060]   I know.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.460]   It turns out to be asleep through that.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.540]   But again, you're talking about the guy that
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.780]   has the weird sleep habits anyway.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.780]   He was so tired.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.220]   He just went right now.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.220]   All you need is an MRI machine at home.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.060]   Every time an has trouble sleeping,
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.420]   would you skip an MRI?
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.100]   It goes right out.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.900]   Every night, get an MRI.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:40.260]   They did.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.340]   They put headphones on me.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.860]   I would have liked a VR headset.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.900]   That would have been kind of cool.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.660]   I agree.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.580]   I was a little disappointed.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.580]   The quality of the headphones was terrible.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.620]   Because I had heard that Audis, who
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.740]   makes the best very, very high-end headphones--
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:55.460]   Audis-y.
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.300]   Audis-y.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.940]   A-U-D-E-Z-E, Audis-y.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.860]   I had heard that they made also made headphones for MRI
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.380]   machines.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.620]   I thought, oh, I'm going to get some nice sound.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.700]   Apparently, they don't make the best headphones
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.620]   from the MRI machines.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.060]   And then I made the mistake of asking for country music.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.100]   So that was probably a problem.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.860]   Why did you do that?
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.700]   Oh, here's--
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.860]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:27.860]   It's not fun.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.500]   I did not sleep.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.900]   Anyway.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.340]   Anything else from the IoT event?
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.620]   Batteries are still a problem.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.260]   We know that.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.380]   Oh, I was excited.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.380]   Oh, y'all, check out Dracula Technologies.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:46.780]   Not only are they making a slightly more dense PV sensor--
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.580]   sorry, a PV energy harvester.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:54.300]   So a photo vac to take cell for a sensor that you can pop a
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.700]   sensor, put the sticker on top of it, and run without a
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.700]   battery for 10 years.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.200]   But--
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.740]   So it's like a little mini solar panel.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.260]   Solar panel.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:05.340]   It's a tiny--
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.140]   It's a solar panel sticker.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.580]   But they're making it of a material that can be recycled.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:13.100]   And before, I was like, that's pretty cool.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.180]   And then I was like, oh, I must talk to them.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.020]   So I'm really excited.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.220]   Also, they have a cool name, Dracula Technologies.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.660]   Because they're sucking the sun's energy.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.180]   Energy out of the sun.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.700]   Can they make them bigger?
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.020]   Could they generate enough power to--
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:26.540]   No.
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:26.980]   No.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.460]   No.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.860]   That's magic.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.340]   You know, I love the logo, too.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.580]   It's like a little bat.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.140]   That's cool.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:33.660]   I know.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:34.620]   Look at that.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.740]   That's hysterical.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.100]   You know, this is why we love having you on Stacey.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.380]   Because you have--
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:46.060]   this is stuff that is so infrastructure.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.420]   We don't pay attention to it.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.820]   And yet it is so influential in everything we do.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:51.940]   This is cool.
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.820]   Yeah, you should look up Cilla.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.340]   You're too--
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.420]   Did you see the new Woop Band?
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.460]   And with the new battery that's extra dense and--
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.580]   No, I did.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.380]   Smaller?
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.380]   Oh, my god.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:03.860]   Hold on.
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.100]   This is really exciting for tech infrastructure
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:06.660]   and all stuff.
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:07.500]   Whoop.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.020]   Whoop, which has the best name ever, is a fitness band, right?
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:12.740]   Whoops.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.020]   Whoop 4.0.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.980]   Whoop.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.780]   Yes.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.700]   And it's smaller and thinner because it
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.780]   has a new battery technology.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:25.540]   And that battery technology is basically more energy dense.
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.300]   So you can do more with less.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.660]   And it's from a company that was started in 2011
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.420]   from Georgia Tech called Cilla.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:39.660]   And this is going to be the hotness in wearables.
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.780]   Because basically, you could either make your devices smaller
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:45.620]   or keep them the same size and have them run for longer
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.060]   or do more.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.340]   And that's-- when I said batteries are still a problem,
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.900]   that's what I'm talking about.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:52.300]   So this is really cool because we
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.180]   don't have a lot of new material science.
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:55.900]   Those things don't come along very often.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:56.300]   So--
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:56.800]   No.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.140]   Yay.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:57.660]   OK.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.460]   I Googled Whoop and Cilla.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.260]   And I came out with the wrong-- how do you spell Cilla?
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.780]   It's S-I-L-A.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.020]   Oh, I was spelling it like Cilla and Chiribdis.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:07.020]   Cilla?
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.020]   Chiribdis.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:08.980]   Chiribdis.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:11.500]   Cilla and nanotechnologies.
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.020]   Mm.
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.380]   See, this is a perfect example.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.620]   So are we making breakthroughs in battery chemistry?
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:20.220]   Because that's been one of the things that's
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.300]   brought back everything.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:21.780]   Everything.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   Totally.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.860]   This isn't a change in battery chemistry.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.740]   It's a change in how much energy they can store.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.300]   There are breakthroughs happening.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.100]   But the hard thing is-- I mean, think about this.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.540]   This was 10 years ago that they discovered this.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.700]   So commercialization from material science--
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.060]   It takes a long time.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.220]   This actually, I feel like, actually happened really fast.
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:39.900]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.060]   But yeah, it takes a long time.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.060]   So the battery--
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:46.900]   Cilla battery is 17% higher energy density, which sounds like not
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.340]   a lot, but that can make a huge difference.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.860]   But it took them 10 years to get to market.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:56.620]   So I don't-- I mean, these are--
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:59.420]   it's incremental, but it's--
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.340]   the cool thing is, when you don't--
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.980]   the IoT has so many different types of devices
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.140]   that require different levels of power.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.420]   So when you're talking about a computer,
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.380]   a 17% increase may not matter that much.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.860]   But when you're talking about a wearable,
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:19.020]   it can actually give you a whole extra days battery life,
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.300]   which is a lot.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.940]   Or smaller devices.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.940]   Did they talk about the chip shortage at all?
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.500]   They did talk it.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500]   They had a whole panel on the chip shortage.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.060]   You read my article.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.220]   You're just helping me out here.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.060]   I love you, Leo.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:32.820]   Thank you.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.660]   0.6.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:37.900]   Well, no, I haven't--
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.580]   I wrote this up.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.060]   --we're all--
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:39.700]   A week ago.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:40.300]   We're all in here.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.660]   Yeah, you don't understand.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.980]   We're all interested in, though, because it's still
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.300]   impacting everything.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.100]   Absolutely.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.380]   Cars to laptops and phones.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.780]   Yeah, so it's still going on.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.140]   Nothing really new to report.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.340]   They're saying what?
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.940]   Did I say 2023 in there?
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.820]   I'm looking at-- yeah.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.420]   So we're still on that time frame.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.460]   They talked about--
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.060]   there's just a fundamental breaking point
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.180]   in the industry that is pretty subtle.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:11.820]   But you know how we talk about all the new fabs,
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:14.340]   and we get all excited about Samsung building fabs
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   and Intel's?
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:19.060]   Those are all on really big 300 millimeter wafers.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.500]   This is my 300 millimeter wafer.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.980]   And all the automotive chips have been made
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.460]   on these smaller 200 millimeter wafers.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:33.860]   So there's been this whole industry designed around--
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.820]   Do you have a mill--
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.860]   We're all a vanilla wafer?
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.540]   Because that's about--
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.580]   I'm not eating on the next one.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:38.580]   That's big.
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:42.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:46.700]   But the issue is a lot of the automotive companies,
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.860]   they've been stuck on this 200 millimeter technology.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.700]   A lot of the MEMS sensors that we depend on for IOT
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.260]   and even manufacturing, all of that stuff
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.540]   that translates the analog world into digital
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.780]   is on this older technology.
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.180]   But no one's really investing in it.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.860]   And all of a sudden, we're like, hey,
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.100]   let's do the internet of things.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.860]   Let's build electric cars.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.660]   And then suddenly, we all want that.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.020]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.420]   Oh, so that's a big--
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.860]   That took them by surprise.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:13.900]   They didn't expect that.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.740]   Right.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.620]   And no one wants to build those factories anymore
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.140]   because there's no economies of scale there?
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.940]   There's legacy nodes.
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:21.860]   Yeah, there are legacy.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:26.420]   So the car manufacturers need to step up and be like, all right,
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.220]   we need to get in on 300 millimeters,
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.380]   which means their chips are going to be more expensive,
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.100]   not necessarily--
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.580]   And they don't need to be that big.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:39.300]   They're wasting precious silicon.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.820]   But not anymore.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.180]   Because now there's a sufficient demand for them.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.860]   So the reason you would--
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.100]   Oh, my internet connection just went unstable.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.740]   Yes, you froze momentarily.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:49.940]   But you're all right now.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:50.540]   You're good now.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.020]   Are you on the fiber still?
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.340]   I didn't plug it in today.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:54.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.740]   What do you don't like us that much, do you?
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.540]   Do you plug it in for TOEFL?
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.040]   I know.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.460]   I didn't plug it in this--
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.260]   Hold on.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.380]   No, no, no, no.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:03.900]   I'm teasing.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.100]   I don't care.
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.580]   Oh, now she's going to go--
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.540]   When I do the next break, if you want to plug it in,
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:09.300]   you can.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.220]   I'll plug it in then.
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.340]   OK.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.620]   She plugs it in for TOEFL.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.020]   I guarantee.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.860]   I did not plug it in this booty.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.180]   I plugged it in for my event yesterday.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:19.740]   OK.
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.860]   I was talking about something.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.100]   Why do you even unplug it?
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.940]   Why don't you leave it always plugged in?
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.020]   His deck come final.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.340]   Because I'll trip over it.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.340]   Oh.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:29.220]   It's a cord.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.020]   Well, you need to fix that.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.180]   Yeah, that's a-- there's a solution for that.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.020]   There must be.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:35.940]   It's worth it.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.500]   It's worth it.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.620]   You don't know.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.620]   Punch a hole in the wall, run it through the wall.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.020]   I don't know.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:47.300]   You don't need to have wire going across the desk.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.220]   Yeah, I understand.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:48.940]   But surely--
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:51.380]   In the fiber things back there.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.900]   Shocking.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.300]   Oh, there's a fix for that.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.300]   Get a longer cable.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:55.900]   That's what you need.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.380]   You can run along the wall or something.
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:57.940]   Y'all.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.460]   Oh, y'all.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:13:59.980]   I don't--
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:00.620]   Oh, y'all.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:00.940]   You could take the--
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.100]   I don't know what I was talking about.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.260]   You can take the woman that had a text.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.260]   But you can't take the screen right now.
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.780]   We'll send work up there to wire you up.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.220]   Yeah, right.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.500]   All right.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.500]   Taking time out.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.580]   We're going to take a time out.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.540]   We'll come back a lot more to talk about.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.340]   Jeff Jarvis is out for the day.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.260]   But it's so nice to have Jason Howell here
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.780]   from all about Android hands-on photography.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.380]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.540]   That's somebody else.
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:26.620]   That'd be-- that'd be--
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.540]   Tech News Weekly is that show that you do.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:28.820]   Yes.
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:29.540]   There we go.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.860]   Hands-on photography is Mr. Ant Pruitt.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.220]   He's also community manager in club twit.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:39.740]   And Stacy Higabotham, who plugs it in for TOEFL, but not for us.
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.140]   I thought it's not true.
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.900]   She does a show with Kevin Tofl called the IOT show.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.060]   It's really, really good.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.420]   Our show today-- actually, it's kind of fun.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.900]   Both are sponsors today are podcasts.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.940]   This has something about the podcast, because I guess.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:59.460]   My good friend Kevin Rose, who is a brilliant, brilliant guy,
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:03.820]   and has a real knack for finance and making money.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:06.780]   He's a partner at True Ventures right now.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.980]   But he's well known as one of the top 25 angel investors.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:11.740]   Actually, Bloomberg called him that.
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.500]   Time magazine called him one of the top 25 most influential
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.860]   people on the web.
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:17.780]   Founder of Dig, Dig Nation.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.220]   He was our dark tipper on the screen savers.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:21.620]   And he's done some great podcasts.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.020]   His newest is all about finance.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.340]   It's called modern finance.
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.180]   If you're trying to keep up with that crazy world
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.940]   of crypto, the crazy crypto world,
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:37.980]   Bitcoin's NFTs, robo investors, decentralized finance,
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.900]   you'll want to know about modern finance.
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.100]   It's a crypto show for the novice and expert alike.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.780]   I have never listened to a better show
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:48.260]   for helping me understand the very complicated notions
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.740]   behind all of this stuff.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.220]   For instance, in fact, it was his very first episode.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:52.860]   I loved it.
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.300]   He talked all about NFTs.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.940]   The first time I ever understood what NFTs are.
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:59.300]   But he does it without dumbing it down.
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:05.820]   Tech experts are on entrepreneurs, artists, creating NFTs.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.060]   He interviews the top experts in the field.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.860]   In fact, he does two shows, which is great.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:12.100]   One, the consensus episode every week,
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.820]   explores weekly news, distills it
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.820]   into digestible information.
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.820]   The other, also every week, deeper interviews
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:22.180]   with individual crypto founders and NFT artists.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:25.740]   So this is a great opportunity to catch up
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.300]   on a topic that's changing rapidly,
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.020]   but also has deep impact for everything we do.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:35.140]   Plus, it makes you the life of the party,
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.860]   if you know about crypto.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:42.380]   Everybody's saying, what do you think of this new NFT thing?
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.380]   Get informed about your investments.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.700]   Learn about the next big thing in crypto or NFTs.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.060]   10 years ago, people called crypto currency a scam.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.300]   Five years ago, people thought it was a fad.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.700]   Now it's already a trillion dollar market.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.660]   And growing the modern finance podcast
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.980]   helps you make sense.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:02.460]   Of all the coins, the NFTs, the chaos,
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:06.060]   equip yourself with the knowledge of where things are going,
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:09.500]   with our good friend, and probably one of the best guys
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.260]   in the world to explain all of this, Kevin Rose.
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.500]   Look, the financial landscape is harder than ever
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.940]   to navigate, but you're not doing it alone.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.020]   Download and subscribe to Modern Finance,
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.020]   wherever you listen to podcasts, that's Modern Finance.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.020]   You find it in Apple's podcasts,
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.860]   Google's podcast, every podcast player.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.300]   And of course, you can find out more at modern.finance
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.140]   on the web.
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.700]   The last person on the next train out,
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:36.860]   listen to Modern Finance and get ahead of the future
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.700]   of finance.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.260]   After this show is over, I strongly encourage you
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:43.060]   to download the latest episode and listen.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:43.900]   You will learn something.
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:47.660]   It's really, and it's quite entertaining, quite fun.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.540]   I do love, love Kevin Rose.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.940]   Modern Finance, wherever you get your podcasts.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:58.500]   So interesting debate going on about,
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.860]   remember we for a while blocked Huawei.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.740]   The country of Lithuania has now said,
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:08.020]   throw away Chinese mobile phones,
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:11.340]   particularly Xiaomi phones,
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.460]   because they found the devices had built-in
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.580]   censorship capabilities.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:21.580]   They could actually turn on a thing that would disable,
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:27.940]   for instance, posts about Tiananmen Square,
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:32.380]   or pictures of President Xi that the president didn't like.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.620]   Built into the phone that you bought in Lithuania.
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:38.260]   Yikes.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.100]   Yikes.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:44.900]   - Was it Chinese surveillance, or was it somebody else's
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.740]   space? - Yeah, no, it was Chinese.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:46.940]   And I think that the,
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.740]   I think my suspicion is that they're just put in
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.940]   by default into these phones.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:53.340]   This was particularly Xiaomi,
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.140]   but I mean, the Chinese government has control over this,
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:59.580]   and this was intended obviously not for Lithuanians,
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.420]   but since it's in the phone,
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.980]   there was some concern that it could be used
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.300]   against Lithuanians.
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.460]   - Oh, Scooter X is pointing out that Xiaomi's statement
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.340]   denies the allegation that the company intended to do that.
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:12.460]   - Of course not. - But.
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.580]   - However, they did not deny that it exists.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:19.460]   - Yes, we comply with the GDPR,
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.620]   but the software's in there.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.820]   That's the point, they didn't deny it.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:29.420]   - 449 terms, apparently, more than 449 terms
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.180]   that could be censored, things like long live
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.700]   Taiwan independence, free to bed.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:35.740]   - How long?
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.060]   - Things like the drinkers.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.140]   - Wow.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.140]   - Yeah, no good.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:42.900]   - Let's see.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:46.620]   - And not isolated to the Xiaomi phones that are sold
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.300]   in China is my understanding either.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.500]   - Well, that's the point, yeah.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.140]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.820]   This is like, yeah.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.020]   - Xiaomi does not sell phones in the United States,
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:57.540]   nor does Huawei, right?
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:59.780]   But I have a Xiaomi phone, I really liked it.
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:00.780]   In fact, I've had a Huawei phone.
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:01.620]   - Xiaomi?
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:02.460]   - They're very good phones.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:03.300]   - Xiaomi's, they sell them here?
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.340]   - Xiaomi sells IoT devices.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.300]   - Oh, that's right, the MiCams and all that.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.820]   That's right.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.220]   - And, Tuya is one of the big providers of,
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:18.260]   what are you called, like branded IoT,
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.500]   like Energizer has a few IoT devices.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.780]   Tuya makes the backend software
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.340]   and hosts their stuff in the cloud.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.780]   Now Tuya says that their cloud is,
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.980]   they have geographic regions
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:32.500]   and data sharing does not happen between regions,
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.700]   but some senators last week or two weeks ago,
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.780]   actually were like, hey Tuya, we should sanction those guys.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.940]   We should not allow their stuff in,
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.100]   which is a big deal 'cause like Walmart's stuff
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.660]   is built on Tuya.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.420]   Okay, sorry, since we're talking about it,
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.260]   I have to read that in there.
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.900]   - Lithuania's National Cyber Security Center
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.140]   said it found four major cybersecurity risks
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.940]   for devices made by Huawei and Xiaomi,
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:57.420]   including two related to pre-installed apps,
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.140]   one involving personal data leakage
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:04.700]   and as a result, warned against use of these two brands.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:09.700]   Voice of America was one of the band-censored phrases.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.900]   Long live Taiwan independence.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:18.540]   - Yeah.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.380]   - Can you buy it?
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.300]   I feel like you can still buy Xiaomi phones in the US.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.140]   I don't think they've been--
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.220]   - I mean, you can if you're ordering online through
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:27.620]   certain-- - Right, you have to.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:29.580]   - Obviously, you can't get them in carriers.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.300]   You're not gonna walk into a carrier store
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.740]   and buy a Xiaomi phone.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:35.020]   - And the Department of Commerce has warned against them.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.060]   That was years ago.
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:38.020]   That was several years ago, yeah.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.820]   - Yeah, I mean, same with Huawei devices.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.220]   I don't think you still buy Huawei devices as well.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.180]   It's just the same, highly discouraging.
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:48.180]   (sighs)
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:51.300]   I neglected to mention this on Sunday on Twitter.
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.220]   I wanna mention it now.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.700]   Clive Sinclair has passed away.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:57.020]   You may not know the name,
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.420]   but there are a lot of people, certainly,
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:03.420]   of my generation who used Sinclair's early personal computers
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.620]   like the ZX Spectrum,
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.660]   which was how Linus Torvald's creative Linux
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.500]   got started in computing when he was a teenager.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:15.140]   There's a Sinclair ZX Spectrum.
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:21.700]   I had an early time, was it a Timex Sinclair?
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.580]   The ZX80, you remember that one?
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:24.540]   They were inexpensive.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.060]   They were about a hundred bucks.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.180]   They weren't very powerful,
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.780]   but for many people,
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.340]   this was the first experience they had
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.540]   of a small personal computer.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:39.680]   He was also famous for designing the first pocket calculator.
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:45.340]   British guy, and so the ZX was most popular in the UK.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.540]   But I think it was time,
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.820]   am I right that it was Timex that brought it
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:50.180]   to the United States?
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.660]   I think so.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:52.660]   I think you can remember so.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:57.660]   The Timex Sinclair ZX81, that's the one I had.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.180]   Little membrane keyboard.
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:00.020]   See, there you go.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:00.860]   Yes, that's right.
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:01.700]   Remember that?
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:02.540]   The membrane keyboard.
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.860]   My friend had, I didn't have one of these,
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:08.060]   but my friend when I was a kid did,
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:12.420]   his father had a bunch of, at the time,
[01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:13.820]   the computers of the time,
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.180]   and I remember going over to his house
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.180]   and nerding out on that.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.260]   Not super powerful, but at least, you know,
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.100]   in a house.
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:20.220]   But it was pretty sweet at the time.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.780]   Yeah, I thought.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.180]   So that was about a hundred bucks.
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:27.740]   What was, I don't remember what those TRS80s.
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.260]   Oh, much more expensive.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.900]   Yeah, much more expensive.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:34.620]   But TRS80, maybe it was a thousand or eight hundred bucks.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.700]   There were, though, things like the VIC-20
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:39.860]   and the Commodore 64 that were less expensive.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:41.780]   Or 500.
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.140]   But people went up and bought VIC-20s
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.100]   and they were so underpowered and so useless,
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:50.100]   they just ended up collecting dust in the closet.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:52.020]   I mean, they, you know.
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:55.460]   Did they turn those into speaking spells?
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:56.460]   'Cause that's what it looked like.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.300]   Yeah, kind of.
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:04.100]   So the ZX was sold as a kit as well.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.660]   You could buy it, assemble, I think,
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:09.300]   but you could also, you could also solder it yourself.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:14.260]   July 1982, the TS-1000 was sold in the United States.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.900]   The first computer under a hundred bucks.
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.900]   Personal, IBM, personal computer wasn't,
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:21.500]   hadn't come out, wouldn't come out,
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.740]   or had come out the year before,
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.100]   the Macintosh wouldn't come out for two more years.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:29.620]   So it was kind of Apple II, IBM PC era.
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.900]   But those were all very, very expensive.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.060]   So.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.140]   So the TRS was roughly a thousand.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:40.020]   We'd save the C64, maybe 500.
[01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:41.380]   I don't know, you know, I have to ask somebody
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.220]   who bought it back in that time.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.420]   The C64 was cheaper, I'm pretty sure.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.620]   It was definitely cheaper, yeah.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:50.940]   I mean, the Commodore 64, that was my computer.
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.980]   I was saying that growing up.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:54.420]   But I can't remember, you know, like,
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.420]   I don't think I bought it, my parents bought it for me.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:57.780]   Right, yeah, that's what we don't know.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.340]   The sixth grade, I don't know.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.180]   I'm guessing somewhere.
[01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:04.820]   $595, according to Wikipedia,
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:08.740]   the VIC-20 was a lot less.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:09.740]   Yes.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.060]   And that was the problem.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:14.740]   It was only 5K of RAM.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.580]   So we, you really couldn't.
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:17.420]   Oh.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.220]   Yeah, I know, you couldn't do it a lot.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.620]   Actually, I think this had clearly had 1K of RAM.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:28.340]   You know, it was for hobbyists in the early days.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.580]   Times of first, we've come a long way.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.420]   We really have.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.620]   Anyway, Clive's the current.
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:36.820]   Dead at the age of 81, and maybe a name you don't know,
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.540]   but he certainly was a big part of the personal
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:44.540]   computer revolution certainly as important as Wozniak and Jobs.
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:48.220]   Timex said they sold 600,000 of them.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:53.180]   So I'm just looking through Google images, ZX81 games,
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.820]   and just remembering the games on that.
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:57.580]   Monster maze, 3D monster maze, yeah.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:02.180]   I'm just reminded of how much more we had to use our imagination,
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:05.020]   like our imagination really filled the gaps then.
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:08.540]   Now everything is created to this sharpness that, you know,
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.660]   replicates reality.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.340]   But back then, I mean, it was a lot,
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.300]   obviously a lot more rudimentary.
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.300]   And there was just something magical about filling in the gaps
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:18.380]   with your own imagination.
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:19.580]   Like it was just what we had.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.860]   We probably took it for granted, but looking back,
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:24.340]   that's the thing I miss is just like, I don't know,
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:26.580]   but there's just something about that era of games that I love.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:29.020]   This is 3D monster maze.
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:33.500]   I feel like there could be a market for recreating some of these games.
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:34.260]   Oh, there it is.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.460]   Like that on a phone, you know, or something.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:37.180]   Oh, there it is.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.180]   There are a lot of them.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.420]   I would never give up today's gaming.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.020]   I mean, God, some of those things are freaking beautiful.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.580]   And you're just like, yeah.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:46.460]   Yeah, works of art.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:50.060]   Doesn't Mr. Technologizer have some games like this available?
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.980]   He wrote a game in a basic.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.460]   He was talking about this on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:58.980]   Harry McCracken.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:00.100]   And he wrote a game--
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.620]   let me actually could show you his website.
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.620]   Because you could play it.
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:03.180]   Arctic81.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.500]   Arctic81.com.
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:05.380]   I think that's it.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.660]   Yes, it is.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:07.740]   There he is.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:10.620]   And he actually has it--
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:13.540]   you could play it online at Arctic81.com.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:17.940]   I love the website because it really looks like that era.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:20.940]   I will describe you surroundings at the top of the screen.
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:21.820]   Tell me what you want to do.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:24.740]   Mostly two work commands like Go West, get Brick, Inventory,
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.540]   Help, Save and Exit.
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.020]   You ready to play?
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:28.900]   All right.
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:30.140]   You are an Inglue.
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.380]   Obvious exits out.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.220]   You see Shovel, Warm Coat.
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.620]   Your command.
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.420]   Take-- let's do get.
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.860]   Get Coat.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:40.820]   Thinking.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:41.540]   Good.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:42.420]   You see Shovel.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.140]   Get Shovel.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.100]   I bet we'll need that too.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.260]   It's the old--
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.780]   The old--
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.540]   OK.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:49.860]   You see nothing special.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.180]   Oh, oh, let's go out.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.300]   I'm now leaving the Eglue.
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:58.620]   See, this is when I would fail because I would say leave.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.700]   Go West.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.500]   Well, you had to play these games.
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:04.100]   You would kind of learn that you can't--
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:04.900]   Learn to send type.
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:05.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.300]   You have to--
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:06.800]   Yes.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.540]   There's stupid-- and this is written in basic.
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:10.900]   The funny thing is Harry actually had a typo.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.700]   He was publishing a book and would not
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:15.700]   run if you had typed it in from the book page after page
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.340]   of this code.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:22.220]   Don't you imagine the type that is and you get to the end.
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.140]   Oh, when I was a kid--
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:24.580]   Kid.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.380]   I was in my 20s.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:29.620]   But in the early days of Atari, you'd buy Compute Magazine
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:32.020]   and you'd type in long listings.
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.820]   And if you made a mistake, you'd have to find it.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.820]   And of course, you couldn't save it to a floppy disk.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:38.300]   You had to save it to a tape.
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.660]   Tape is cassette, right?
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.060]   Yeah, cassette tape.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.660]   There I am.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:46.500]   Memories of that myself.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.900]   I'm spending a lot of time punching in just numbers,
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.180]   machine code.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:51.780]   I have new respect for you, Jason.
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:54.180]   I didn't know you went that far back.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.780]   We read-- remember last week we read the ignoble prize
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.860]   winners.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:01.140]   Oh, boy.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.340]   I didn't realize this.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:07.100]   They had a broadcast of their prize winners,
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:10.580]   a presentation like you do with the Academy Awards of the Emmys.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:13.900]   It was pulled down on YouTube because they
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:19.080]   had the temerity to feature a 1914--
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:23.540]   yes, 1914-14, 1914 recording of a tenor singing
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.180]   finiculie finicula.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:29.380]   Of course, anything from 1914 is in public domain.
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:34.260]   That didn't stop YouTube from taking it down at the behest of SME
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.480]   in groups on behalf of Emerald Wise Music Group,
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.200]   BMG, Rights Management, LLC, UMPG Publishing,
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.500]   PDL, Cobalt Music, Warner Chappelle, Sony ATV,
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.620]   and One Music Rights Society.
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:47.620]   Oh my god.
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:48.180]   That's cool.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.980]   Was it for the recording?
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.840]   I mean, is that the first--
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.360]   Yeah, well, it's content idea, apparently.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.480]   Well, what do you want them to do?
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.160]   Have somebody sit in at the desk,
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.840]   listen into these things personally over and over
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.400]   to make sure they pass and say, OK, this is approved?
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.560]   But the AI do what it's potentially doing very well.
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.800]   They solved it today.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.400]   It's back up.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:12.320]   It's been down for the week.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:15.240]   Still unsuccessful at making any contact with any human being
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.120]   at YouTube, they say.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.620]   We think we solved the problem by recording
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:23.500]   our own performance of finiculae, finiculae.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.700]   And then editing that into the video, instead,
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.660]   the new musical performances by Soprano Maria Ferrante.
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.340]   It's probably better, right?
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:31.820]   Probably.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:36.680]   Yeah, so now if you want, you can watch the 31st annual
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:41.420]   ignoble-prized ceremony featuring--
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:42.860]   Wait a minute, if I play this, YouTube's
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.740]   going to take me down.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.660]   That's the original.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:49.280]   Let's play the other one that has their--
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.700]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:51.420]   This is the original.
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:53.000]   No, sorry, play this one.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.660]   I've got to get it right.
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:56.660]   It's too late.
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:57.180]   It's too late.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.180]   We've already taken down.
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.020]   We're broken.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.500]   We're already taken down.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.740]   But worth watching.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.740]   A long year under pandemic conditions,
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:09.740]   the ignoble board of governors kept a single-minded focus
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:10.540]   on our goals.
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.740]   I want to head, let's just for the dog like that.
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.740]   He's engineering principles.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.740]   Oh, he's carrying his status.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:15.740]   He's carrying his status.
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:16.740]   I like it.
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:22.580]   And all the things needed to produce the 31st annual
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:24.580]   ignoble-prized ceremony.
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:29.620]   Well, this year--
[01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.460]   It looks like that.
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:31.620]   What year is this?
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:36.700]   2021.
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.340]   Is it really 2021?
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.860]   The COVID-19 pandemic--
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.820]   Anyway, I'll let you watch this.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:44.860]   It was still up on Vimeo.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:46.420]   They finally got a backup on YouTube
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:49.980]   by re-recording the song.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.500]   But this is the problem with, of course, content ID.
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.820]   I mean, there's no way that that's not a public domain
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.820]   song from 1940.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:56.900]   Absolutely.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:05.780]   Jeff Bezos says he was so influenced by his several-minute
[01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:08.700]   trip to the top of the Earth's atmosphere
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:11.260]   that he's going to give away $1 billion
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.900]   to support conservation around the Earth.
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:16.940]   He says, "Nature is our life support system.
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:17.580]   And it's fragile.
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:20.100]   I was reminded of this just this past July
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:25.340]   when I went into space-ish with space adjacent with blue
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:25.860]   origin."
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.300]   And the folks did last week.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:27.980]   Not him.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:29.740]   Yeah, they went into space.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.420]   I heard that seeing the Earth from space
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.980]   changes one's point of view of the world.
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.180]   I was not prepared for just how much that would be true.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.420]   That's pretty amazing, since he only had a couple of minutes
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:38.700]   up there.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:41.500]   But I'm not knocking it because a billion dollars--
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.220]   A couple more minutes than I.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:44.100]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.380]   He's ahead of me.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:49.140]   A billion dollars-- this is through the Bezos Earth Fund,
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.460]   which he started in 2020 to execute his $10 billion
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:56.580]   commitment to fight climate change.
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:59.900]   So actually, I like this statement.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:02.500]   "The natural world is not better today
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:06.780]   than it was 500 years ago when we enjoyed unspoiled forests,
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:12.140]   clean rivers, and the pristine air of the pre-industrial age."
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:14.380]   Oh, just what we need is a bunch of billionaires
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.220]   trying to optimize nature.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:18.380]   Screw that.
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:20.180]   You know what we didn't have then?
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:23.140]   We didn't have overnight delivery of something online
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.180]   in order of something.
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:26.340]   We didn't have a fleet of jets flying back and forth
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:30.700]   from Memphis, Tennessee to bring me my kitty litter.
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:32.780]   We didn't have climate change either.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:35.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.060]   Amazon is going to have a big--
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.900]   I guess we've got to do this too, Jason--
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:42.100]   hardware event for September 28.
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:43.980]   Yes, I'm going to be there.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:45.340]   Well, I'm going to be watching.
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:46.740]   Normally I would be here.
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:49.300]   Well, do they stream it?
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:51.100]   I think they did not stream it last year.
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.420]   They just invited the press, and then everybody
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.700]   got to talk about it later.
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:57.340]   It's a curious decision.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:58.660]   But you got to go.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:00.180]   You got to go.
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:03.460]   Yeah, so when it's physical, I've been to all of their events.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.940]   And when it's not physical, I've been to all of their virtual events.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.740]   But I can come back on Wednesday and tell you everything.
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:08.740]   Yes.
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.580]   Guess what?
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.660]   We'll know all about it the next day.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.020]   The event is invite only says the Verge,
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:16.700]   so don't expect a public livestream.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.740]   But the Verge will be covering all the news
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:23.260]   as soon as it happens September 28, 12 PM Eastern, 9 AM Pacific.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.980]   Hey, good news, Ant.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:28.180]   We don't have to move any shows.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.020]   Hey, we'll just talk about it the next day.
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:31.180]   Thank you, kindly, sir.
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:32.820]   Oh, hello, Luya.
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:35.420]   I'm curious to know why Amazon chooses to do that, though.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.020]   Like when literally all of their competitors
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:41.540]   are doing the livestream, why do they choose not to?
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:42.020]   Stacey?
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:49.580]   I don't know.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:52.740]   They're relatively new to the device launch game.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:54.940]   They've only done four of these.
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:58.620]   And they like to announce dozens of devices, don't they?
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.900]   Yeah, I got it.
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.060]   Like every year, I'm going to tell you, y'all are lucky,
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.180]   because when you sit down, the first year,
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.740]   there were like 78 pieces of news.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.900]   The second year, it was like 131 pieces of news.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:12.180]   Maybe that's why.
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:15.900]   It is really a lot.
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:17.620]   I'm just going to tell you.
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:22.620]   So last year, they announced a bunch of--
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.540]   actually, it was this year, I think, earlier this year
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:28.020]   in the spring, what they call day one editions.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.380]   You remember that, Stacey?
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.180]   Things that they were thinking about making enough,
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.820]   enough people bought it.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:36.060]   It was their Kickstarter.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.980]   So I put down some money on something.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.860]   In fact, I think I ordered the only thing that got approved,
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.860]   which is the Smart Sticky Note printer, which
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:51.900]   is a printer that you pair to your Echo device,
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:55.380]   and then you can say Echo, print my grocery list,
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.660]   or something like that.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.540]   Or print my to-dos, and then it'll print it out for--
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:00.740]   Oh, look, you can print a Sudoku.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:01.540]   Oh, predict your Sudoku.
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:03.260]   I now love it.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:04.460]   Perman's boy.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.700]   It's a Sudoku printer.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.300]   Woo-hoo.
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.820]   But I ordered it.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:14.340]   The goal was met on day three of 30.
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:19.940]   Still, it says, supposed to ship between July and September.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.300]   Hey, chip shortage, man.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:21.620]   Chip shortage.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:22.740]   Maybe a chip shortage.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.660]   Yeah.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:25.620]   I mean, the Wi-Fi chips have been in short supply.
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:29.180]   Can I just tell you today, Amazon said, hold on.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:32.620]   I'm pretty sure this is under-- not under embargo.
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.140]   Have you been talking to Bezos?
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.620]   Maybe Amazon didn't say that.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:37.220]   No, but I've got to check.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:37.900]   I was like, hold on.
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.940]   I bet you plug it in for Bezos.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.140]   It is not under embargo.
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:43.060]   OK.
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:43.620]   Sorry.
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:45.260]   I'm like--
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:51.940]   Today, Amazon announced in limited edition $229.99 Echo
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:56.500]   Studio featuring Billie Eilish's cover art for happier than ever.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.020]   Oh, gosh.
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.020]   Which I'm like, fuck.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:59.020]   Oh, gosh.
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:03.980]   Who the hell you're saying is not that?
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:04.480]   All right.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.540]   You want to see it?
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:05.540]   What's it?
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:07.140]   Here's what it looks like.
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:10.620]   You can have an emo teenager, mooning away
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.540]   on your Echo device.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:16.460]   I guess if you're a late big fan of Billie Eilish.
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.580]   It just seems so niche.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.140]   And I guess it's just a cover print job.
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.140]   Billie Eilish.
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.260]   I don't understand.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:25.460]   I'm curious about the economics of this
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:30.740]   and why Amazon's doing something like this on hardware.
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.820]   Because like--
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:35.020]   Well, did they have like a children's Echo?
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.100]   Remember they had--
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.100]   They have a children's Echo.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:40.940]   And they actually did a line of Echo, like smaller $99
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:44.900]   speakers that were like the Diane von Fustberg
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.740]   and two other designers that you could buy with their imagery
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:49.620]   on their Echo's.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.660]   It's a little expensive.
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:53.820]   Is $230 the normal price for an Echo studio?
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:54.300]   No.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:55.980]   Yes.
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.100]   They're usually $250, aren't they?
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:37:58.580]   Yes.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:00.380]   $30 more, says the headline.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:02.140]   Just for Billie Eilish.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:05.260]   I would buy it for the catch factor, frankly.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.460]   People I know would come and say, why do you have
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:10.260]   some woman's face on yours?
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:10.620]   Who knows?
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:13.460]   Maybe Shutterfly will start to allow us
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:18.780]   to print out our own photos on an Echo show or Echo studio
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.380]   coming from--
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:24.260]   I mean, it's clearly for the massive Billie Eilish fan.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:26.260]   There are a lot of Billie Eilish fans out there, y'all.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:26.740]   There are.
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.020]   Definitely they are.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:28.660]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.180]   The Echo studio is $200.
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:32.460]   This is $230.
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:33.420]   So yeah, you're right.
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.420]   $30 more.
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:35.340]   $30 more.
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:37.420]   OK.
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.220]   It also comes with what, four months of Amazon music,
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.500]   which does not seem like a smoke and deal to me.
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:47.580]   It should come with lots of Billie Eilish music.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:50.500]   No, six-- you get six months to Amazon music unlimited.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:51.620]   Oh, six months.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:56.620]   And you can listen to Happier Than Ever in Spatial Audio.
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.820]   So the only thing you can listen to on this device
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:02.820]   is that over and over and over again.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.460]   Because you're a big enough fan to have Billie Eilish
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.060]   on your device itself.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:09.540]   So they figure that's probably what you want.
[01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:14.140]   Here's what it would look like on your Billie Eilish desk,
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.700]   with your Billie Eilish poster.
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:19.940]   And your Billie Eilish wallpaper is really funny.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.780]   It's a puzzling device.
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:22.780]   I bet it's--
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:25.860]   Because I'm like, who is this?
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:28.060]   How expensive is it to make?
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:30.740]   What is the-- what is the conversation?
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:34.340]   If even Alexa could be Billie Eilish's voice,
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.460]   that would be cool.
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:36.260]   But no, they have a product.
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.660]   Yeah, that makes sense, though, because that's
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:38.620]   a digital product.
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.780]   But this is a physical product.
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:42.220]   It's going to sit there forever.
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:45.140]   I just thought it was Flummox.
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:46.420]   Flummox, I tell you.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:47.420]   Flummox.
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:48.420]   Flummox.
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.260]   You probably don't want Alexa whispering to you as the thing.
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:54.540]   So you probably don't want Billie Eilish's voice.
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.060]   She talks about this.
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.060]   She does not.
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:58.060]   She's not whispering.
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.100]   Whisper singing.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:39:59.940]   She says some more.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:07.100]   I am a fan of Oki, a UK-Y battery product.
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.540]   So won't be buying them on Amazon anymore.
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:13.980]   They had 599 other Chinese brands have been kicked.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:20.100]   Cicked from Amazon for review fraud.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:25.300]   Amazon say where it says we're not targeting China, which
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:30.260]   state-owned Chinese central television said they might be.
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:36.100]   But you can't do things like send emails out saying,
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:40.380]   we'll give you $10 off if you give us a positive review,
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:43.500]   because that games the review system.
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:47.060]   Amazon says customers rely on the accuracy and authenticity
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.020]   of product reviews.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.900]   So we suspend ban and take legal action against those
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:56.100]   who violate these policies wherever they are in the world.
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:03.100]   Oki, M-Pau and Shenzhen, Yukeshu Technology Company.
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:06.580]   They say also that $20 million of their funds
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:11.660]   have been frozen by Amazon for stuff already sold.
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:14.060]   I'm sure you can still buy those devices.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:17.220]   Amazon makes money even when they kick vendors off their plucks.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:19.620]   It's incredible.
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.620]   It's incredible.
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:27.300]   See, well, I guess I should do a change log.
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:28.540]   Should I do a change log?
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:31.260]   Let's play the drums.
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:34.780]   Oh, Burke is filling in, so he's going to have to find the button.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:37.820]   Find where John stored the drummers.
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:38.900]   Where do they put them?
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:40.060]   There they are.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.060]   There we go.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.060]   Change log.
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:47.020]   Bada, bada, bada, bam.
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:49.740]   Jason, I should make you do this change log.
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:52.100]   You know, it's so funny that you say that,
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:56.300]   because I actually wondered if you were going to today.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.780]   Because I know how much you love the change log.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:00.140]   Well, at this point--
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.940]   I don't even do it anymore.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.340]   I let you put it all together.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:07.340]   So I very rarely see anything worth talking about.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:10.740]   Well, like this, YouTube gets official video downloads
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:15.340]   on the web saving you from using very sketchy sites.
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:15.940]   All right?
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:16.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:19.020]   Have you ever used a site to like rip a YouTube?
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:19.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:21.140]   Well, I use YouTube DL.
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.340]   YouTube hates that.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:23.780]   Because--
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.500]   Right, exactly.
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:28.380]   Content creators sometimes count on YouTube
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.660]   not allowing you to download stuff you watch there.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.140]   Right.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:34.300]   Maybe the thinking is if you did that,
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.220]   you might edit it out, edit out the video, the ads,
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:40.340]   and distribute it yourself or something like that.
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:43.500]   But ask Aunt Perrude how do you remove a watermark
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.700]   from this video that I just downloaded?
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.140]   Really?
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:46.820]   Oh, boy.
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:47.820]   Really?
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:52.180]   That is a common comment that I get for one of my videos.
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.980]   I have a video that talks about removing objects.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.700]   It's a tutorial in Premiere where you can remove certain objects
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.700]   in the video, just using mask.
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:02.780]   And every single comment on there is asking me,
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:05.940]   well, can you just work for watermarks?
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.420]   Dang.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:10.260]   I thought you could download videos.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.260]   I'm not sure if you can download them on YouTube.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:12.700]   Is that--
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:15.180]   No, I don't believe that that's a baked in feature.
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:17.500]   Well, actually, I'm pretty certain it's not a baked in feature.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:18.100]   No, it's not.
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:20.700]   Unless you happen to have a built in extension running.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:22.700]   Oh, see, I guess I must be.
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:23.780]   So how would I--
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.940]   I'm looking-- because I have YouTube premium.
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:30.300]   By the way, this is only for YouTube premium subscribers.
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.100]   And only in India or France.
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.780]   So this is a very limited trial.
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:35.180]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:36.180]   But--
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:36.860]   Oh, there you go.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:39.700]   This is why I hates the change law, Jason.
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:43.740]   Only in India and France.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:47.580]   Downloaded videos can be played back by YouTube.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:52.140]   If you go to youtube.com/feed/downloads,
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.980]   see, then I would-- I don't have any downloads.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.020]   But if I did, they would be right here.
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:57.140]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:58.260]   Testing this out.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:43:58.780]   OK.
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:43:59.140]   Who knows?
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:01.660]   Maybe coming soon to a YouTube near you,
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:02.940]   you'll get a download button that
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:06.060]   isn't the result of an extension.
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:09.100]   Everybody hated this idea.
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:11.820]   But Google's going to do it anyway.
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:13.660]   Idle detection.
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:18.180]   An API built into Chrome 94 for desktop and Android
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:21.420]   that detects user inactivity.
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:23.100]   Both Mozilla and Apple complained.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:28.900]   But it's in there.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:29.780]   Why are they complaining?
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:31.820]   Why don't they-- the feature is designed
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:34.220]   for multi-user applications like meetings, chat,
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:35.620]   and online games.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:39.780]   The reason maybe because in schools,
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:43.500]   a lot of times when you're doing a Zoom class or something
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:47.340]   like that, they want to make sure that you're actually there.
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:50.020]   Not pretending to be there for attendance purposes.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:54.620]   So this feature notifies when a user is idle.
[01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:57.460]   It looks at things like the mouse, the keyboard, screen
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:02.220]   locking, or user switching away from the screen.
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:05.140]   Applications which facilitate collaboration
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:09.140]   require more global signals about whether the user is idle
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:12.520]   than are provided by the existing mechanisms that only
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.300]   consider a user's application with the applications--
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.980]   interaction with the application's own tag.
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:21.460]   So developers from Slack and Google Chat liked it.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:25.540]   Mozilla's Tantec-Chillux said, I consider idle detection
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:29.020]   too tempting of an opportunity for surveillance capitalism
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:33.020]   motivated websites to invade an aspect of the user's physical
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.260]   privacy, keep long-term records of physical user
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:40.140]   behaviors, discerning daily rhythms like, oh, it's
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:41.300]   this lunchtime.
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:44.020]   The computer sits idle for an hour.
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:47.980]   And then using that for proactive psychological manipulation.
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:50.460]   Don't you think a burger from Burger King
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:53.300]   had been right and nice right about now?
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.940]   In addition, such course patterns
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:58.100]   could be used by websites to surreptitiously max out
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:02.300]   local compute resources for proof-of-work computations.
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:05.540]   I owe Bitcoin wasting electricity.
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.300]   Crypto mining during lunch.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:13.340]   So despite the complaints, Chrome 94
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:15.100]   has the idle detection API.
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:18.380]   So there's something for everybody.
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:21.620]   Google Maps can now adjust its Android Auto UI
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.900]   for right-hand drive cars.
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:27.300]   So I guess the UI--
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.220]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:30.780]   I don't know.
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.180]   Oh, is that for the people who drive on the left?
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.220]   Yeah, like in the UK.
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:34.740]   OK.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:35.740]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:38.220]   We're all like, what?
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:40.420]   Why would you ever want to do that?
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:43.860]   So normally, the navigation bar and the turn information
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:45.500]   cards are on the right side.
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.740]   Because I guess if you're driving on the left side of the car,
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:50.340]   that's you using your right hand, or I don't know.
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:53.980]   But they can also adjust to the left side.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:57.580]   See how full of good stuff the change log is.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:59.340]   You didn't even miss that.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:02.260]   Google Search Filters introduced on the web last year
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:05.340]   are now coming to Android.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.700]   Explain to me, Jason.
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:08.620]   What is the Google Search filter?
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:09.900]   Do you think I read these, Leo?
[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:10.380]   OK.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:12.180]   Sometimes I just kind of pop through it.
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.180]   It's changed.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.300]   I go, oh, that sounds significant.
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:17.980]   It's a change.
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.740]   Gmail Search Filters on Android work independently
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.500]   or post-search.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.900]   The former means they appear after tapping the top.
[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.460]   Now, pill-shaped field before entering a query.
[01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:28.740]   As such, you can look for emails from a particular center
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:31.300]   recipient as well as by date and attachment status
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.500]   without a particular term in mind.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.660]   This is rolling out for Gmail for Android.
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.740]   If you understood that, you're probably happy.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:40.340]   Yeah.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.140]   Somebody's happy.
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:42.260]   You're happy.
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:42.780]   Google's iOS--
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:43.540]   I put that in there.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:43.740]   I don't know.
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:44.740]   I don't care.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:45.740]   No.
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:47.420]   If you didn't, what would I make fun of?
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:52.100]   Google's iOS 15 app updates bring Excel, YouTube, Music,
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.620]   and Photos, Widgets, Focus Mode support.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:59.860]   So it's funny because Google, after iOS 14 came out,
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:03.500]   you may remember because they didn't like the privacy stuff,
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:06.340]   declined to update any of their apps for months and months
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:07.540]   and months.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.620]   But I guess they said, well, I guess
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.580]   we're going to have to live with it because they updated
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:13.420]   their apps for iOS 15.
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:17.140]   Pretty much the day it came out, you
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:20.940]   get widgets for photos, which is great.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:24.660]   There's also widgets for YouTube Music, extra large,
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:27.460]   widgets for by two grid of--
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.740]   so here I'll show you.
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:30.260]   This is big.
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:32.300]   So you get what's playing right now,
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:36.820]   and then this for by two grid of tracks.
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:37.900]   These are huge widgets.
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:38.660]   Oh, wow.
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:40.060]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:41.140]   Big old widgets.
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.260]   Another feature that is really nice, by the way--
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:45.980]   and I hope Android does something similar in iOS 15
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:49.700]   is this Focus Mode, which it's kind of like do not
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.220]   disturb on steroids.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.020]   Like I have it right now, Focus Mode, I'm at work.
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:58.540]   So it knows when I get to work and then sets the do not
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:02.820]   disturb as I've previously indicated automatically.
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:03.820]   That's really cool.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:05.900]   You can do it for going to sleep and all sorts of things.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:09.180]   Google's going to pay attention.
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:12.540]   And it will affect Task Reminders, Google Maps
[01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:15.500]   Navigation, Home Doorbell notifications, Gmail
[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.700]   notifications, and so forth.
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.700]   Google has a Focus Mode.
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:21.700]   They do that already?
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:26.420]   Yeah, part of the whole digital well-being tool set.
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:27.140]   Cool.
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.340]   Yeah, it does something very similar.
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:29.020]   It's very similar.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:32.180]   Oh, well, in that case, it's about time Apple.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.660]   Exactly.
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:37.540]   Google Meet for Web gets automatic brightness boost
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:39.940]   when you're underexposed and Pruitt likes it.
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.980]   Now if they could just get white balance--
[01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:43.300]   That dad gum white balance.
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:47.060]   That's kind of cool.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.900]   And a lot of it will say, oh, you're not very bright.
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:52.220]   Let's see if we can turn up the volume.
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:54.420]   Having too much light behind you,
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.900]   such as a window on a sunny day, can
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.060]   be challenging for cameras.
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:00.060]   Google Meet on the Web now automatically detects
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:04.700]   when a user appears underexposed and enhances the brightness.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.900]   So here's the--
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:06.460]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:08.020]   Here it is in action.
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.700]   You can see there's some people here who are a little dark.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:13.140]   And Google's just brightening them up.
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:14.260]   That's cool.
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:14.460]   Nice.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.700]   Yeah, it looks great.
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:17.820]   That's a nice idea.
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:19.580]   You can control adjust video lighting
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:22.260]   from more settings and video.
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:23.140]   So you can turn it out.
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:25.260]   It'll be rolling out today, fully available
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:28.860]   in the coming weeks for Google Workspace customers.
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:32.060]   Oh, you got to pay for it.
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:34.260]   Oh, of course.
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:36.380]   No.
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:38.980]   Things cost money, otherwise they cost your beta.
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.020]   They cost your beta?
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:44.540]   Data.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:45.380]   Data.
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:45.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:46.340]   Your product is--
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:48.300]   Either you're the product or you're the customer.
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:50.220]   That's right.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:52.820]   And you'll like this, Stacy.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:55.460]   Fitbit starts rolling out snore and noise
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:57.580]   detect for the Fitbit--
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:58.380]   On the left.
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.580]   --sense and Versa5.
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.020]   Apple does it so well.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:02.220]   So I wonder if they're using--
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.460]   I wonder if they're using the same algorithms they built
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.380]   for the Nest Hub 2.
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:10.620]   Because--
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:11.180]   Well, because--
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:11.620]   That's right.
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:12.820]   The Nest Hub does it.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:13.900]   You were talking about that.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.660]   That's right.
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:18.580]   This is actually very important because it could be sign of sleep
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:19.020]   apnea.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:21.260]   It could be sign of other issues.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:22.380]   It also looks--
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:25.340]   Or it's a sign that you don't snore that badly
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:28.540]   and your husband is just really sensitive.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:30.180]   That's what I think.
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:32.060]   That's my story.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.940]   We played my stores on this show,
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:36.140]   and everybody made me feel much better.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:38.180]   That's nothing.
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:40.020]   I know Lisa did that to me the other day.
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:41.820]   She recorded my snoring.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:42.660]   How wooed.
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:47.140]   I'm not going to plug it in for her.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:48.700]   That's for sure.
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:52.100]   And that's the Google change law.
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:59.700]   US government says, new, new, new, no to Zoom.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.780]   They had a $15 billion deal for $5.9,
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.500]   which is another video conferencing company.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:10.780]   The US government says, no, because--
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:12.140]   China.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:14.700]   Zoom's China ties could make its acquisition
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:18.020]   of the software company a national security risk.
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:22.580]   $5.9 is based in San Jose, California, I think.
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:24.100]   Is that right?
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:27.740]   The $5.9 acquisition is subject to certain telecom
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:30.100]   regulatory approvals said Zoom.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:33.020]   We have made filings with the various applicable regulatory
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.300]   agencies, and these approval processes
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:42.340]   are proceeding as expected $5.9 decline to comment.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:47.340]   Paying attention to the Chinese connection with Zoom.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:49.540]   Zoom is actually--
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:51.180]   I don't know if Zoom has Chinese ties--
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:52.740]   that the software is written in China,
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:56.220]   but the company is owned by Americans.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.740]   Do we mention cameo calls?
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:00.220]   Last week, we were talking about cameo.
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:02.500]   I don't believe that we mentioned the call message.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.000]   No.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.100]   New feature, you can have a celebrity call you.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:10.940]   For up to 15 minutes, one on one,
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:14.240]   the celebrity sets the duration time and price of the call.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.800]   Average is right now around $31.
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:21.500]   Well, let's go see who we can talk to on Zoom.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:25.620]   Here is Hagbert.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:28.220]   What's the guy in the Harry Potter?
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.380]   Eggbert--
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:29.880]   Hagrid.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:30.380]   Hagrid.
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:30.880]   Hagrid.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:31.380]   Hagrid.
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.900]   The guy who plays Hagrid.
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:33.900]   You can talk to him.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:34.900]   He's available right now.
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:36.500]   He's just sitting there waiting for your call.
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:40.580]   $15 for two-- $15 for two minutes.
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:41.800]   Hagrid's waiting.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:44.000]   Hello, Harry Potter.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.660]   $15 is not very much to be able to put guest colon
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:51.380]   Hagrid from Harry Potter in our show notes.
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.880]   Should I just call him and say, how you doing?
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.480]   What's up, Greg?
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:57.040]   How you doing?
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.140]   No.
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:53:59.100]   Who else can I talk to?
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.520]   Austin Nichols, Nikki Blonsky.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.760]   She was in hairspray.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:07.920]   Is this the lowest rung of celebrity hell at this point?
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:08.720]   Yeah, I'll take--
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.520]   I was going to ask when you get on there.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:11.520]   No, no, no.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:12.520]   I deserve that.
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:16.800]   If someone can make $7,000 a month just to do--
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:20.040]   Well, and the thing that makes it nice is you can also
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.120]   give some to charity.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:24.040]   And I think a lot of celebrities do that.
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:27.320]   Well, look, you could talk to not Tom Cruise tomorrow, 3 o'clock,
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:29.440]   $25 for two minutes.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.440]   Maybe you'll do--
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:31.440]   Not Tom Cruise.
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:33.960]   What if people wanted to call me to ask me personally
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:35.920]   their questions and have me actually answer them
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.920]   and ask them questions about--
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:37.480]   $15.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.880]   How much would I charge for that?
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:41.080]   How much should you charge for that?
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:42.200]   I have no idea.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.000]   I think we should--
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:43.600]   How much would you pay?
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:45.520]   We should call some of these people.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:47.800]   We should just make this a feature on the show.
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:50.200]   And now it's time for the cameo.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.800]   They probably charge more if you're using it in a podcast.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:55.120]   I was going to say they probably have something in their terms
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:56.240]   of service.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.240]   You may not use this.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.280]   You can't broadcast, can't record.
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.640]   Yeah, it's just for you.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.280]   Patrick Labb, you could call him and ask
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.160]   how you pronounce his name.
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:08.240]   I was trying to see--
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:11.760]   I was trying to find the September guy in there,
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.000]   but he's not.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.400]   No.
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.360]   It's not--
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:15.920]   It's not--
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:17.040]   Oh, it's a bus.
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:18.160]   Wait, Melissa Etheridge?
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:18.680]   I was not sure.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.400]   Yeah, Melissa Etheridge.
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.000]   You could talk to her for three minutes for no money.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:24.840]   No, there's no--
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.600]   How can that be?
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.760]   This must be like--
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.040]   Access.
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:33.080]   She'll be taking cameo calls, $0 for three minutes.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:37.000]   Apparently, she's just doing it for the goodness of her heart.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.680]   And there's two tickets remaining.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:41.480]   Maybe cameo paid her to do it.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:42.480]   Like, would you please do this?
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:44.040]   To get people to use this.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.360]   Yeah, people to use it.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.760]   That's pretty cool.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:50.120]   We're onto you, cameo.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:51.960]   Anyway, just thought I'd pass that along
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.440]   if you want to talk to Hagbert.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:57.240]   Whatever the hell is me.
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:58.120]   Hagrid.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.000]   Hang her.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000]   Hang her.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:00.480]   Hagrid.
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:01.000]   Hagrid.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:01.480]   Hagrid.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:02.920]   Hello, Harry Potter.
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:04.720]   I'm angry.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.440]   Angry Hagrid.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:08.160]   I will talk to you for two minutes, exactly.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:11.560]   For $15.
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:14.880]   All right, I think it's time to wrap this puppy up,
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:16.920]   because, well, it's almost waffle time.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.080]   So we are going to get to the picks of the week.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:22.880]   Next.
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:27.080]   We, as always, start our picks of the week with--
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:28.200]   I'm the person.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:29.080]   A random person.
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:31.840]   No, we always start with Stacy.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:32.800]   I'll do.
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:33.840]   We always start with Stacy.
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.920]   Stacy Higg and Buffham.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:36.480]   You're random pick up.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:39.800]   OK, this-- it is random.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:40.480]   I'm looking around.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:41.240]   I'm looking at my desk.
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:42.080]   Oh, geez.
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:43.080]   You don't have to do one.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:44.880]   You know, it's not required.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.080]   It's not--
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.840]   I don't know why I think today.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.400]   I know that feeling where you're just going,
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:50.240]   quick, what do I have?
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.200]   What do I have?
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.760]   I have a Melissa Etheridge Amazon Echo show.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.920]   Yeah, let's do the Billie Eilish.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.120]   They-- can I retroact?
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:00.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.160]   Go back in time.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:02.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:03.000]   I got one.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:03.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.680]   I'm going to go get it.
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:05.760]   Because I got it right here.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.480]   The Billie Eilish one?
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:08.280]   Excuse me, Stacy.
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.080]   Pardon me.
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:09.560]   Excuse me.
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:11.160]   What's he going to come back with?
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.160]   Do it.
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.520]   And this is already going really well.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.040]   I have.
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.040]   It's in my hands.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.040]   Oh, I could have gone around the back.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.040]   I have--
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.160]   Where's my hand?
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:26.480]   Here it is.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.440]   This is-- I'll do this for Stacy.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.320]   This is Stacy's pick of the week.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:37.040]   It is my all-ree the Chihuahua Amazon Echo.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:37.960]   Wow.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:38.520]   How about that?
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.480]   Courtesy of Mr. Micah Sergeant.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.000]   Only $50 extra.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.240]   Where did that come from?
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.160]   What is that?
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:47.520]   I'm so confused.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.360]   That looks like a Micah Sergeantism.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.920]   I think Micah must have made this.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.600]   This is just how easy it would be to make Billie Eilish.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.680]   Totally.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.680]   Echo, shut up.
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:57.760]   Say it, shut her fly.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.520]   Like they're missing opportunities.
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:01.080]   I think it's just a little house pass.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:02.840]   I think it's pretty little sleeve.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:05.160]   It's pretty little sleeve.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.960]   Can you go up for your Nest audios?
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.640]   Because I want to do that because they could be prettier.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:13.640]   It's the all-ree echo.
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:14.800]   All the echo.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:15.880]   Oh, hey.
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.800]   Echo, that's Stacy's pick of the week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:19.600]   Excellent.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.160]   Very nice.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:23.560]   Very, very nice.
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:24.480]   I have failed, Joel.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:25.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.160]   No, I don't care.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:28.600]   I never have a pick, so it's OK.
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.040]   I couldn't complain.
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:37.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jason Hell, are you going to do anything?
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:38.080]   You want to do something?
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:38.920]   Sure.
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:40.920]   Well, yeah.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:43.040]   So I kind of had that moment earlier today, too, where I was like, what the--
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:43.880]   What do we do?
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:45.120]   --are going to bring on.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.400]   But then I realized yesterday we had an event.
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.680]   If you were watching--
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:50.360]   I think it was during security now--
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.160]   Yes.
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:53.000]   --that there was a fire event in the area.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000]   And it was actually pretty close to the studio.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.640]   I had to stop the show and say, we just
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:01.640]   want to save what we've done so far in case we suddenly have to leave.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:02.120]   Yep.
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.120]   We got an evacuation warning.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:05.600]   Kind of crazy.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:07.600]   That's a little too close to home.
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:09.160]   I'm going to lie.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.360]   But I've been using an app lately.
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:18.120]   And honestly, actually, now that I say this, I don't know if it's only--
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:21.960]   it's only Northern California and only California itself.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:26.440]   But basically, I've been using an app that shows fire events.
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:29.120]   So when something comes up, when something--
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.440]   and it's called, by the way, WatchDuty.
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:34.320]   But when a fire event is reported,
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:37.120]   I've found that this app updates super quick.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:39.240]   And I get a notification right away.
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:45.560]   So when the fire event happened, I was notified on my phone very, very soon
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:46.200]   after it happened.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.640]   It was the Ormsby fire.
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:48.400]   I think that was it.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:48.920]   Yes.
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:49.480]   Yes.
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:50.440]   Yes.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.520]   And yeah.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:53.880]   So I got a notification as it went along.
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.800]   Like, you can subscribe via text message.
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:00.280]   And I'm sure we all do, at least here in this area, to the Nixl updates.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:02.520]   This is kind of similar, but it's embedded into the app.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:07.600]   And you can kind of go around the map and find other fire events in the area.
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.960]   It can be a little slow to update.
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:11.360]   But eventually, you can find--
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:12.720]   yeah, it's really slow to update.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:14.720]   I'm not really seeing some of the other ones right now.
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:17.200]   At least this show on the one that I've been from yesterday.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:19.120]   But it gives you a little bit of the information.
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:24.600]   It tells you kind of where it's at right now, as far as progress is concerned.
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:25.360]   Is it contained?
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:27.120]   Is it not the percentage that sort of stuff right now?
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.520]   Well, I wish we had this yesterday.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.760]   That's great.
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.760]   Yeah.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.560]   And I found it to be pretty reliable.
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:36.680]   Is it only fires or is it all natural disasters?
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.600]   This is-- no, this is just fires.
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:45.080]   And I'm actually thinking now, if I go into settings here for notifications--
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:45.440]   OK.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:47.760]   So it is limited to this area.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.480]   So it's probably not very useful that most anybody listening or watching.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:52.000]   There's a great thing.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.920]   But if you're at the Bay Area, you want an app like this, because holy cow, these fires
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.520]   they suck.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.840]   And they move fast.
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:04.920]   Which is why they evacuated, I think, 900 homes yesterday in our area, because you don't--
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:07.840]   you know, they move fast and you don't have time to get out.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:09.440]   So that's good.
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:10.000]   I like watching.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000]   Scary stuff.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:17.440]   But there are a number of apps that I found on the Play Store that track fires.
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:21.200]   And I'm sure there are apps that track other natural disasters and everything too.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.440]   We happen to live in fire country apparently now.
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:30.520]   And I've tried some of the other ones, and they're really slow and kind of choppy and everything.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:32.280]   This is kind of the best one that I've found so far.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:33.480]   So it's called Watch Duty.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:33.480]   It's called Watch Duty.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:33.480]   It's called Watch Duty.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:33.520]   It's called Watch Duty.
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:34.280]   It's called Watch Duty.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:40.440]   Who lives in our area and is a viewer was filling me in on the arms of fire yesterday,
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.680]   because Declare in the IRC chat room was watching Watch Duty and knew it was going on.
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:46.040]   So--
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:46.840]   There you go.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.600]   So proof of concept yesterday.
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:49.120]   Yay.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.120]   Thank you, Declare.
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:51.120]   Hopefully that's helpful.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:51.880]   Yeah.
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:53.800]   Or is it DC layer?
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:55.280]   I don't know.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:56.280]   Declare?
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:58.560]   Declare, I get it.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.200]   I declare.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.200]   It's time for Ant-Pruitz.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.040]   Pick of the week, sir.
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.920]   That's where you and that southern Georgia accent kills me at the time.
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:12.360]   Well, I declare, sir.
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:16.800]   It is time, my friend, for your pick of the week.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:18.840]   I just added this first one here.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.200]   Future moments, because Mr. Howell is on.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.440]   You've ever heard of Future moments?
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:23.960]   Nope.
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:24.480]   Mr. Howell?
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.240]   Oh.
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:26.440]   Future moments?
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:27.440]   Mm-hmm.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.440]   I don't believe so.
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:34.520]   They do a lot of mobile apps for content creators to do music and videos and things of that nature.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:43.280]   But just recently, they've been able to port their iOS apps over to Mac OS.
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:46.160]   I saw a press release for that, like the day or so.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.160]   Ooh.
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:50.400]   And made me think about you because you and your music production stuff.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:51.400]   Ooh.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:52.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:53.400]   Maybe you have something of interest for you, sir.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:54.400]   Nice.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.640]   Look at this mic swap, which models well-known microphones.
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:00.320]   Ah, I think that's kind of...
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:04.240]   So you could have an old, timey radio mic, a Shure SM58.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:06.280]   An SM7B is Sony Lavalier.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:08.160]   I'm going to have to play with this to see how.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:10.040]   God, this is the nerdiest thing I've ever seen.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.280]   It's so nerdy, but I love the idea.
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:13.280]   Yeah.
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.280]   That's great.
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:18.680]   You can have Studio G-Rume or Studio G-Rume B.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.640]   I saw it and I was like, "Man, I always see these cool things."
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:22.640]   Oh, I'm downloading this.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:24.480]   Cool things for the iOS side of thing.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.600]   I never see it on Android.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.040]   So now on Android, but mic swap is...
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.520]   I'm going to steal this one, boy.
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:33.720]   Let me go look at the Android, see what they got here.
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:38.040]   Audio fix, video master, hear boost, and video verb.
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.040]   Let's see what these do.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:40.040]   Audio-furb.
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.040]   I believe that adds reverb.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:42.040]   Oh, nice.
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:43.040]   Reverb to the center of the video.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.360]   Boost improve the audio in your video.
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:47.360]   Video reverb.
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.360]   Hello.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.320]   But Android doesn't have the mic swap?
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:53.320]   No.
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:54.320]   Nope.
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:55.320]   Nope.
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:57.760]   Everybody, this sort of went...
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:02.280]   Well, this one looks like we can import a video just the volume as a 6-pan equalizer.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.280]   This is nice.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.440]   It's a video master.
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:06.440]   So it's all audio, it sounds like.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.080]   Hear boost, which enhances...
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:09.800]   So it's swapping what?
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:10.800]   The mic on the phone?
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.760]   Should I swap the mic on the phone for a telephone pin new 47?
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:14.760]   Yeah.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:19.680]   If you could swipe the mic on your phone for a $2,000 microphone, wow.
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:23.040]   And it'll sound just like the real thing.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:24.040]   Uh-huh.
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:25.040]   We'll see.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:27.040]   I'm going to download it because that's a cool idea.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.040]   I like the idea.
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.040]   Yeah, it does.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.040]   I doubt it's...
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:32.640]   I'm not on Mac OS, so I don't know.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:33.640]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:35.640]   So I just thought I'd share it as I thought of a mistake.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:36.640]   Nice.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:37.640]   And when I saw that...
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.640]   Thank you.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.120]   I actually had it here.
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:48.840]   I've been playing with these Marshall monitors, the Marshall monitors too with the active noise
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.920]   cancellation.
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:54.520]   I tend to get a little bit leery about headphones because it's like...
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:58.520]   Everybody says they just sound good and most of the time they don't.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:02.080]   The price of these were a little bit pricey when I first looked at it.
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:06.000]   Then I tried them out and I said, "Okay, they actually do sound pretty good even if they're
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:12.000]   Bluetooth and wireless like this or I can plug them into my computer and monitor that
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000]   way."
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.440]   I listened to them with checking out some Hans Zimmer because that's like my standard
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:22.520]   test is to see how things sound with all of the different frequencies from 20 Hertz
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.680]   up to 20 kilohertz.
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.600]   Make sure everything's coming through.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:29.720]   It's got a flat profile allegedly.
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:35.200]   So you're going to hear a little bit more mid and de-lose when you're enjoying your music.
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:38.520]   So that might throw some people off because a lot of people, they either want it super
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:44.440]   duper bass heavy or they want it a little bit more in the upper tier, the higher frequencies.
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:49.080]   But yeah, I tried those out and I let their hard heads try them out and if they like them
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.920]   they must sound pretty good.
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:56.360]   Those are the Marshall monitor too with active noise cancellation.
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:58.280]   I don't like the little...
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:00.440]   You see that little yellow thing on there?
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:02.440]   Yeah, what is that volume?
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.680]   That's just a control knob.
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:07.000]   I think that's a little finicky.
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.600]   I think they could design that a little bit better but from an audio quality standpoint,
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:12.840]   yeah, they do pretty good.
[02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:14.280]   I kind of like the retro look.
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:15.640]   They're kind of cool looking.
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:16.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:17.640]   Marshall is...
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:18.640]   Yeah, Marshall is.
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:19.640]   Is that the Marshall amp folks?
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:20.640]   Yes, yes.
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.640]   It's the same.
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:22.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:23.640]   It's the same font.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:28.040]   So they're following the style of their amps with the gold and the black.
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:29.600]   I like how it collapses.
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:30.600]   That's really nice.
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:31.600]   Sometimes it's headphones.
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:33.600]   Yeah, that was quite nice.
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.400]   Oh, that is expensive but dang.
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.400]   Okay.
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:40.400]   You know, it's actually not expensive for good headphones.
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:41.400]   I know.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:44.000]   Like, and I'm about to kill these headphones.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000]   So...
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000]   But that's the thing.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000]   319.99.
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.200]   People pay for beats for the same amount of price.
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.200]   They're not very good.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:52.200]   I don't sound like beats.
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:53.200]   No, they're not very good.
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:54.200]   They don't sound like good.
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:55.200]   But these...
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:56.600]   I will check them out.
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:57.800]   That sounds great.
[02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:02.240]   And they're hard-headed approved, so hard-headed approved.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:03.760]   Only a plug for your Instagram.
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.120]   What are you posting these days on the Instagram?
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:08.600]   Just little random stuff here and there.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:11.320]   Still shooting some stuff at the football games.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:12.640]   I loved this picture.
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:13.640]   I saw this.
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.640]   I really like this picture.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:15.640]   Yeah.
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:18.080]   Are you sure the white balance isn't off?
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.040]   It's definitely off but it's okay.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:22.240]   I mean, I see that red poppin', man.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:23.240]   That's color-grating.
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:25.240]   Oh, it's grating.
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:28.680]   Oh, that's cute.
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:30.200]   That's definitely shaded to the blue.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:31.320]   But then I'm not gonna say anything.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:33.320]   I'm not gonna, because that would be wrong.
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:34.320]   No.
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:35.320]   That's all right.
[02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:36.320]   Give it to me.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:37.320]   I could take it.
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:38.840]   No, these are beautiful shots.
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:40.040]   I love your moon, by the way.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:41.200]   I don't know how you got that.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:43.400]   That is a very hard shot.
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:49.520]   That was actually a time lapse and it took a long time and a lot of trial and error putting
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:50.520]   that together.
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:52.440]   They had a full moon last night, right?
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:54.040]   This was a couple of nights ago?
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:56.680]   No, I actually shot that a little while back in the...
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:57.680]   Oh, okay.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:58.680]   ...and sort of tweaking it.
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:01.280]   Because, like you said, it's pretty difficult and then you have all the...
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:02.280]   ...reduction to deal with.
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:03.280]   Yeah.
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:04.280]   Yeah.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:05.280]   So hard.
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.280]   Not easy.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:07.280]   On the answer to...
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:10.360]   Follow me on Instagram @_Pruitt.
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:15.600]   Because Stacey failed us so badly with her picks of the week.
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:18.400]   I have two courtesy of the chat room.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.400]   How about that?
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:22.120]   "Bera Tunde Thurston, good friend of the network.
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:23.520]   We love "Bera Tunde."
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.640]   I had his book, "How to Be Black."
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:28.000]   We interviewed him when it came out on triangulation.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:34.520]   Apparently, he just got green lit for an animated version by ABC.
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.240]   It's in development right now.
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:37.240]   Oh, right.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.400]   This is great.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:43.600]   He's going to write an executive producer alongside Courtney Lilly, who is the producer
[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:48.360]   and writer known for Arrested Development and the Cleveland Show.
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:49.920]   Pretty good deal.
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.920]   Awesome.
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:56.520]   Lawrence Fishburn will executive produce even better.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:00.720]   Time people, cinema gypsy productions that did blackish, groanish and mixedish.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:02.440]   I hope they don't call it "How to Be Blackish."
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.280]   But I'm sure they wouldn't.
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:11.440]   So I think that's really good news for a very good friend and a very talented guy.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.440]   That's awesome.
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:14.440]   We'll be watching for that.
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.440]   And here's something for you, Stacey, that I thought you might be interested.
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:19.760]   Again, this is from the chat room.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:22.560]   Thank you, ScooterX, for the "Bera Tunde" pick.
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:23.560]   And thank you.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.040]   I forgot who it was for this.
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:27.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:28.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:29.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:30.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:32.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:33.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:34.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:35.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:36.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:37.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:38.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:39.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:40.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:41.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:42.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:44.040]   I'm going to take a look at this.
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:51.040]   >> From fictional novels to computer science manuals.
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:52.040]   >> What?
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:53.040]   >> This is something she did with her young kid.
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:57.040]   She's partnered with Google to offer a hands-free immersive

[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:04.040]   and Assistant-enabled mobile devices in English-speaking
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:07.040]   countries around the world.
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.040]   You can discover Reese Witherspoon's monthly book picks,
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:13.040]   take a quiz for personalized book recommendations,
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:16.040]   and get exclusive commentary about each book from
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:17.040]   Reese herself.
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.040]   I guess she doesn't read the book, but still.
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:21.040]   >> That would be.
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:22.040]   You know what?
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:24.040]   Here's a skill that I would actually value.
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:27.040]   I hate books with unreliable narrators,
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.040]   but you can't put that on the book cover because that would
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.040]   destroy the people who like it, right?
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.040]   >> Yeah.
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.040]   >> But I hate them.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:37.040]   So if I could just ask Google,
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:41.040]   "Hey, does this book have an unreliable narrator?"
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:43.040]   Google could tell me yes or no.
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:44.040]   >> What's an unreliable narrator?
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:46.040]   What does that mean to be bad?
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:48.040]   >> It's like the worst Deus Ex Machina ever.
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.040]   It's like, "Oh my God, I was drunk the whole time."
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:52.040]   >> Oh, just poorly written.
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:56.040]   Like, I woke up and it was all a dream, that kind of thing.
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:57.040]   >> Yeah.
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:00.040]   I mean, the envelope, the trope has been like,
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.040]   you know, the person who's telling, the narrator's been like,
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:06.040]   "Oh, I was mentally ill the whole time, so you can't trust
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:07.040]   anything I said."
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:08.040]   It's basically the idea.
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:09.040]   So it's not just, it's a dream.
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:10.040]   It's like, "I was drunk.
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.040]   I was mentally disturbed."
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:14.040]   I freaking hate them.
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:16.040]   Like, the girl in the train is the first one.
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:17.040]   >> That's a perfect example.
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:19.040]   And it ruined the book for me.
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.040]   I agree with you on her percent.
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:22.040]   >> It trusts me, fuckers.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:23.040]   >> 'Cause then all of a sudden you realize,
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.040]   "Well, nothing I've been reading could--"
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.040]   >> Yeah.
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.040]   >> It could all be untrue.
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:28.040]   Very frustrating.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:30.040]   I'm with you on that.
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:31.040]   >> I hate them.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:33.040]   They're a big trend.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:35.040]   And I like reading airport-style thrillers.
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.040]   >> But that's the thing, you're so crazy.
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:39.040]   >> They're going to keep doing it.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.040]   >> It's a trend since the 16th century.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.040]   >> Okay, well, yeah.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.040]   [laughter]
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:48.040]   >> It's not something brand new.
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:49.040]   Let's put it that way.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.040]   I looked it up on Wikipedia.
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.040]   And let's see what they say here.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.040]   The term was coined.
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:55.040]   Okay, it's not that old.
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.040]   Not that new.
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:58.040]   It was coined in 1961.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.040]   But I think unreliable narrators have been around for a while,
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:07.040]   like Baron Munchausen's tale of being swallowed by a whale.
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:09.040]   That's a good example.
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:10.040]   And that goes way back.
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:13.040]   Moll Flanders, also another 19th century novel.
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:14.040]   >> Oh, yeah.
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:17.040]   >> So it's--Huck Finn wasn't all that reliable, apparently.
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:19.040]   [laughter]
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.040]   Holding Caulfield.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:22.040]   Well, he wasn't unreliable.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:25.040]   He was just innocent.
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:27.040]   >> I was like young and stupid.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:28.040]   >> Young and dumb.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.040]   Frans Kafka was a mad man.
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:32.040]   So yeah, I guess it's not unheard of.
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:36.040]   >> You can do it well, but a lot of these-- and a lot of these are
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:37.040]   thrillers.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.040]   Like, I really hate it in a thriller setting.
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:42.040]   It's fine if you're making some sort of philosophical point about,
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.040]   you know, existential--
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:44.040]   >> No, I think you're right.
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:48.040]   Girl in a Trains a perfect example where it's something modern and
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:51.040]   new that they do could throw you a curve.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:53.040]   It's like, "Oh, yeah, I gotta."
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:57.040]   >> It's like, yeah, if you're writing a mystery, you can't-- you're
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.040]   trying to assemble the clues and figure out what's happening
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:05.040]   and who done it and then to suddenly just pop in and be like,
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:07.040]   "Oh, I lied about everything.
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:08.040]   That's just weak."
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:11.040]   >> Yeah, well, I can tell you right now, no Stacey Higginbotham novel will
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:13.040]   be like that.
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:15.040]   >> There will be no Stacey Higginbotham novel.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:16.040]   >> What?
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:18.040]   Come on.
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.040]   You come on, you have a novel in the--
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:21.040]   >> Right, right.
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:23.040]   >> In the bookstore right there next to the whiskey bottle, I know you do.
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:24.040]   >> Oh, sure.
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:25.040]   >> Gin bottle.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.040]   >> Oh, hey, I put a cocktail in the beer-- also, I discovered the
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.040]   beer wine and cocktail channel on Club Twit.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.040]   Y'all are going to see me there all the time.
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:35.040]   >> I didn't start that channel.
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:36.040]   >> So many things.
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:39.040]   >> Let me think, who might have started the beer wine and cocktail
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:41.040]   channel on Club Twit?
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:44.040]   I wonder who did that?
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:49.040]   Welcome to our new community moderator.
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.040]   Manny the Clown says, "Is Kombucha allowed?"
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.040]   Yes, it's allowed.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:56.040]   [laughter]
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:59.040]   >> That's just one of many reasons you might want to join Club Twit.
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:03.040]   It's not just talk about Twit shows, although we do have a chat
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.040]   room going in Club Twit for every Twit show.
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.040]   Discord is such a great place to hang out.
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:09.040]   I think we've all made new friends.
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:13.040]   I know I have in our Club Twit Discord members only.
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.040]   Oh, did you add food, cooking, barbecue, and grilling?
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:19.040]   >> No comment.
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:20.040]   >> Mm-hmm.
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.040]   >> So I was the one who did Linux, Hammer Radio.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:26.040]   >> No, I put Hammer Radio.
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:27.040]   >> Oh, you did.
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:28.040]   Oh, good.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:29.040]   >> I put Hammer Radio.
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:30.040]   >> Nice.
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:31.040]   You have a few geeky ones in there.
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:32.040]   That's nice.
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:33.040]   It's really fun.
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.040]   So it's a great community, great place to hang.
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:38.040]   There's other benefits.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:41.040]   Besides the kind of warm, fuzzy feeling, knowing that you're
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:45.040]   supporting Twit, you're keeping our shows going, keeping our hosts
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:46.040]   employed.
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:49.040]   Club Twit also gives you ad-free versions, like that.
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:53.040]   Ad-free versions of every show we do, audio and video.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:57.040]   You get access to the Discord server and the Twit Plus feed,
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:01.040]   which is content that doesn't make it into other shows,
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.040]   things like our untitled Linux show and the Giz Fizz, and Lisa
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.040]   and I are going to do and ask me anything.
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:08.040]   Is it this week or next week?
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.040]   >> No, sir.
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:10.040]   >> No, sir.
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:11.040]   You got a little while.
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:14.040]   >> You're going to do a let's play this week, do trivia or something, right?
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.040]   >> Yeah, we're playing GameStop Friday after Twiit, September 24th.
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:19.040]   >> Nice.
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:20.040]   >> When I think it's P&M Pacific.
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:22.040]   >> Says community manager and Pruitt.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:24.040]   So there's a lot going on in Club Twit.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:27.040]   $7 a month gains full access.
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:31.040]   Just go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:34.040]   And for those of you who just want to buy one show, like say you only
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:38.040]   this in this show and that's all you care about, we are going to set up
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:44.040]   a way to subscribe through Apple Podcasts to ad-free versions of just a single show.
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:46.040]   It'll cost a little bit less.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:50.040]   So if that's your jam, then I say my Club Twit, it's month to month.
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:54.040]   So $7 if you don't like it, cancel at any time and you're done.
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:56.040]   But I think it's a great place to go.
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:58.040]   And I think it's a great way to support what we're doing.
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.040]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:05.040]   Somebody, I had mentioned that the crews that Lisa and I were going to go on
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:07.040]   to Asia in January was canceled.
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:10.040]   And Chris in Miami said, "What, you've canceled the Twit crews?
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:12.040]   No, we have not."
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:16.040]   That's coming up this next summer to Alaska.
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:22.040]   crews.twit.tv, if you want to join Lisa and me, Paul Thorett and his wife.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:25.040]   We're going to go to Alaska on the Holland America, Eurodom.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:28.040]   It's going to be a lot of fun, beautiful ship.
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:32.040]   And we're going to have a Cock Welcome Cocktail Party, a farewell cocktail
[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:33.040]   party, a lecture in between.
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:36.040]   And I think we're going to do some photo walks and lots of fun stuff like that.
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:39.040]   So I've been on this cruise and it's wonderful.
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.040]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.040]   That is still on.
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:49.040]   Go to crews.twit.tv for more information.
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:56.040]   We do this show every Wednesday at about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:17:00.040]   If you like to watch live, there's a live audio or video stream available for you
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:03.040]   at twit.tv/live after the fact.
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:06.040]   We have on-demand versions of the show at twit.tv/twit.
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:10.040]   And of course, the best way to subscribe to any podcast, including all of ours,
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:16.040]   is to use a podcast application, pocket casts, Apple podcast, Google podcasts,
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:17.040]   and subscribe.
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:18.040]   That way you get it automatically.
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:19.040]   You don't have to think about it.
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:22.040]   You can listen to it whenever you're in the mood.
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:24.040]   All of our shows are available that way.
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:30.040]   And if, like the three I mentioned, your podcast player supports reviews,
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.040]   please leave us a five-star review.
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.040]   Help spread the word so everybody knows about this week in Google.
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:37.040]   Thanks to Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:40.040]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:45.040]   Don't forget the podcast with Kevin Tofel for which she does plug in the fiber.
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:46.040]   No, she doesn't.
[02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:47.040]   No, she doesn't.
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:48.040]   Okay.
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:49.040]   No, I did not.
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:50.040]   Okay.
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.040]   I already bought the cable next week.
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:53.040]   It'll be taped down.
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:56.040]   The burp will no longer hate me because I can't.
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:57.040]   I mean, you can make fun of me, Leo.
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:00.040]   Drill some holes in the wall and spring it around.
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:03.040]   You think Andrew drills the holes in our house?
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.040]   I brought the power tools into the marriage.
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:08.040]   Come on, man.
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:10.040]   Now I have two possible titles.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:15.040]   Did you plug it in for Tofel or I brought the power tools into the marriage?
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:17.040]   Both of those would be excellent.
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.040]   Both of those would be great.
