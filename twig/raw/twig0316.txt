[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.700]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show where we cover Google, the cloud, the Googleverse, the Google-ishis,
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.700]   the alphabet A through G.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700]   Danny Sullivan's an air from Search Engine Land.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.700]   Good to see you. Always love having you on the show. Thank you, Danny.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   Thanks. Good to be here.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.700]   Yeah. He's authoritative. This guy has been covering Google since before it was Google.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.700]   Before it was Alphabet.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   Actually, Yahoo used to be a kabono, right?
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   What was Google did?
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.700]   Did you get on the server that they were on?
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700]   Yeah, remember Yahoo? To go to Yahoo in the early days.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.700]   Yeah, there was some weird...
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700]   AkaBono.stanford.edu, I think.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   AkaBono was a...
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   I do not remember that.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700]   Famous sumo wrestle. Were you too young?
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.700]   Yes, I'm very young.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.700]   You missed out on that.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   Oh, that's Mike Elegen. Hello, Mike Elegen. How are you?
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.700]   Good. Good.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.700]   You were up early today covering the Sony announcement.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.700]   Yes, yes. It was great. It was a great announcement.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.700]   It was a Sony announcement. Leo, I'm just going to throw it out there.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   It was a Sony announcement, so everything was better.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.700]   Cool stuff that you're not going to buy.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   And no baloney.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   None at all.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   None at all.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.700]   It was all baloney. I saw like three minutes on the phone and the rest of it was baloney.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   It was funny because I think to me the grandest irony of today's news is that Sony announced
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700]   a 4K screen phone.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   Yeah, that's wild.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700]   Which was very donkeyless.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.700]   And Apple, 9 to 5 Mac, announced that next week they're going to announce Apple TV, which will not support 4K.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   So Apple's major television product doesn't support 4K, but Sony's phone does.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700]   That's...
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   There you go.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, the tech industry and no better observer of the tech industry.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.700]   Well, second only to Mike Elgin, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.700]   Hey, hey.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   All right.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   You're...
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   There's no better.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   Your blog at buzzmachine.com is a must read.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   Jeff joins us every week, of course.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.700]   What is the pixel per inch on the Sony 4K?
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.700]   I have that information.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700]   Because I mean, this is UHD.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   I mean, most of the higher end phones are UHD.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.700]   I'm not sure what the...
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   It's not that much more than UHD, or is it?
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.700]   I don't know.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.700]   It's gigantic.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.700]   It's gigantic.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   I'll have it for you in a second.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.700]   802 pixels per inch, 808.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.700]   And that is...
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.700]   Crazy talk.
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   No human eye can say that.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.700]   No, you can't...
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   After three or four hundred, you really...
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   And what does that...
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   Does that have an impact on power?
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   It does.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.700]   Every pixel costs you.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   So the phone has a gigantic battery.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.700]   It actually gets two days of battery life.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.700]   But it'll be...
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.700]   They said.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.700]   Well, they said, right, if you don't turn it on.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.700]   But it's...
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   Yeah, it's a huge battery.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.700]   It's 300 and something milliamp per hour.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700]   Yeah, 3000.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.700]   So 30...
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   Yeah, it's big.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.700]   Just plain large.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   Let us talk first about the new logo, because I think that's real Google News.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   Google announced it yesterday on their blog.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   And with this...
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   And I had to go to the Google Archives to find it.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   Google Doodle, because now it's just...
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   They took the original Serif font and replaced it with a sans serif font.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.700]   Which is...
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.700]   Design is so funny.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.700]   Because designers always yell at me when I say this, but it's very fashion.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.700]   Yep.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   Driven.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.700]   It's like whatever's...
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   You know, I mean, people thought avocado refrigerators looked great.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.700]   And burnt orange appliances looked...
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   Yeah, I had one of those.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   Designers argued...
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.700]   No, no, no.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.700]   So burnt orange, it's going to be the color for 1972.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.700]   And it's not that we have better taste than they did in 1972.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.700]   It's fashion, right?
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.700]   Right, exactly.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.700]   Designers hate it when I say it.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.700]   Plus we have better taste.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.700]   You know, the thing with this...
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.700]   The thing with any corporate logo, the problem is, is the suits get together.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.700]   You get all these cooks in the kitchen.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.700]   And everybody knows how they want the new logo to make them feel.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.700]   I want to weep with nostalgia, but at the same time I want to feel the future coming.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.700]   They're letters.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.700]   They're letters, people.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.700]   Aren't we getting...
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   Where aren't we going to get a design...
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.700]   You never got a hole of them, huh?
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.700]   We had a designer wanted to come on and talk about this.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.700]   And I said, "We'll give you 10 minutes."
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.700]   Geez, I can't even believe.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   And we need two hours now.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.700]   So this font, they actually invented this font, is called Product Sans.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   Product Sans.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.700]   Product Sans.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   I'm serious.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.700]   I'm serious.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.700]   That's the name of the typeface.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   But see, Sans is very hip right now, right?
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:14.700]   And in fact, if you go to twit.tv, we spend a lot of money on a sans serif font.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.700]   Verlag, it's called...
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.700]   It's called Netcast Sans.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.700]   Netcast Sans, I'm calling that was Verlag.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.700]   But that's very modern, right?
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.700]   It's a sans font.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.700]   You don't do serifs anymore.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.700]   But that's exactly why I do them all the time.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.700]   Because you're Gutenberg.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.700]   Mm-hmm.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.700]   It is supposedly more legible without the serifs.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.700]   Serifs are those little widgets, the little wings.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   But it looks a little more, I guess, my issue with it is it's even more childlike.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.700]   It does look child...now maybe it doesn't help with the guys drawing with a crayon.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.700]   You know what?
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.700]   I'm trying to...I wish we did have that designer on because, for instance, it looks like,
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.700]   you know, we talk about kerning, which is the distance.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.700]   The kerning is off to me, too.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.700]   It looks off to me.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.700]   The kerning is the distance between letters.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.700]   And this looks like a monospace font that doesn't look turned.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.700]   Yeah, the E sticks out there too much.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.700]   And it is, you know, it is getting destroyed by the designers who say that it's that and
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.700]   the other thing.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.700]   But this is one of those things where we'll all get used to it.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   Yeah, no, yeah.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.700]   It'll burn itself into our brains.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   It's just a logo, right?
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.700]   Well, but I think what's even more interesting about it is why they did it.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:35.980]   My theory is that they are trying to look as absolutely warm, fuzzy and innocuous as they
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.460]   possibly can as they're dragged into court in India and Europe and elsewhere over anti-trust
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.700]   charges and privacy issues in Germany and all the rest.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.700]   They want to just look like something right out of preschool.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.700]   Just work Google.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.700]   You can't go.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:56.140]   This is my argument long since on the show that the world sees...the rest of the world sees
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.180]   Google has Godzilla and Google sees itself as a enophylapicus.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.140]   And they're both gigantic monsters.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.140]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.140]   And so Google is trying to present this.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.220]   And it's a fine logo.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.220]   It's perfectly fine.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:15.260]   And the childishness of it is the colors, but a serif added a little bit of...
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.260]   Serif's...
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.260]   Adulpteness.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.260]   Nuance.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.860]   Actually, but again, it's fashion.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.260]   Remember the movie Helvetica, which I loved?
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.260]   Yes.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.300]   And how sophisticated Helvetica was as a sans font.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.300]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.300]   And that really...
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.300]   To go...
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.740]   To go designers, if they really were sharp, would understand that Helvetica is, of course,
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.740]   perfect.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.940]   And I suspect that's what began the sans serif movement.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.700]   Let's not forget Comic Sans is a sans serif font too.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.100]   Well, the whole notion of...
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.700]   I mean, Gutenberg moment coming up.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.420]   Drink, people drink.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.060]   Right Gutenberg's first fonts tried to mimic scribes handwriting.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.060]   Right.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.060]   It was absolutely...
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.060]   Hennradian was absolutely illegible.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.900]   He was the first designer of a Roman font.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.900]   It was beautiful.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.900]   It was gorgeous.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.220]   And it was finally pleasing to the eye, and you could make sense of it.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.940]   Now, that's what we're all trained to do.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:08.900]   If you go to the second link, the fusion thing has the stills of the logos through the ages.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.740]   Ah, nice.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.980]   So I think I'm also guessing that part of what they must have considered, I'm certain
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.180]   that they did, is how it looks tiny, how it looks at different size.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.500]   Apple came out with San Francisco fonts for the Apple Watch, and they liked it so much
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.780]   they rolled it back up into the phone.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.540]   And so this is something that has to look like.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.220]   If you look at the fav icons, for example, their little G has to look perfect, tiny,
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.260]   tiny, tiny on a screen with pixels.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.740]   And so I think that this, you know, the smaller you get a typeface like this, the better it's
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.820]   going to look relative to serif fonts and other things.
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.460]   So this is going to look good on all the devices, all the different places where Google's...
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.100]   Serif's generally don't do well in small places.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.100]   They do not.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.180]   Danny, we were talking about Acabono, and I was trying to remember the original name
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.100]   of Google while this fusion article tells us back rub.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.140]   Yeah, back rub when it was out on, and they used to have a little...
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.340]   The other hand there, you see it.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.180]   And it's sans serif, by the way.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.180]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.180]   That didn't last for very long.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.700]   What I thought was interesting with this is, despite the change, if you look at something
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.660]   like Apple, where you have the single Apple signal, that's very iconic, and I think you
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.300]   really identify with Apple and you know that it's Apple, and you can use that and all sorts
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.940]   of things and have an Apple brand be on it.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.940]   You know, the Google logo, to me, feels a bit kind of cartoonish.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.740]   I know we'll all get used to it, and I can't say that the old logo was necessarily that
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.700]   great either.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.180]   But they still seem to lack that kind of what's your icon, right?
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.740]   I know you got a logo, but that's not the same thing as an icon.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.460]   And they've done that new G thing where you have the dots spin around, there it is, and
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.460]   it turns all into that.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.060]   It'll be interesting to see if they actually adopt that and try to use that G more as their
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.620]   icon as well.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.140]   Or if at some point, Google says, "You know, we actually need a symbol to represent Google
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.620]   and the G isn't going to cut it."
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.620]   You know.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.020]   Ironically, it looks a little bit like the Apple rainbow logo.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.020]   And I think that the G is very problematic because you essentially have a single letter
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.700]   with multiple colors.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:22.100]   And so as that shrinks down in smaller and size, or as you move away in distance, it
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.540]   doesn't retain the line of the letter anymore.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:30.060]   It looks like the splotchy mess, the yellow fades into the white background or whatever.
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.580]   And I think that's really problematic.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.020]   They're going to have to fix that, I think, at some point.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.700]   I can't believe we're spending so much energy analyzing.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700]   I know.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.580]   But I think it is worth talking about because, first of all, it's Google Shell.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.020]   But Google's one of the world's leading brands globally.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.020]   Right.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.860]   And this thing is going to be with us for years.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.060]   And so this is a big part of the identity of this company, I think.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:12:01.220]   Although they did change their logo fairly recently, they dropped the depth, which was
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.780]   really dated, this highlight.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.740]   And to give it a 3D look, they dropped that only two years ago.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.940]   So that's, they have tweaked it before.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.100]   And remember all the attention Yahoo got when they changed.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.300]   Boy, you have to put those two together.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.700]   Daddy, it's just the child-like nature of it.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.780]   And I agree with you, I had the same thought you did, Mike, that this is trying to make
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.780]   them look harmless.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.780]   I find that interesting.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.780]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.300]   That's very preschool, isn't it?
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:36.620]   Going to a lunch in South Park that Google held back when it was still pretty small.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.740]   It was Larry Sergey and maybe 20 other press people.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.460]   And they gave us all Brio trains, the wooden track.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.820]   And they had alphabet cars and they bought GOOGLE.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.820]   And I wish I had that.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.820]   I have it somewhere.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.340]   This Brio train with Google on it.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.340]   And it was very much like this.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.940]   It was a kids' toy.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.140]   But at the time, they didn't have to prove that they weren't trying to say, "No, no,
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.900]   just innocent kids."
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:07.100]   So this may just be their own ethos, not having nothing to do with image, although I'm kind
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.100]   of inclined to be.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.300]   Yeah, Larry and Sergey are basically trying to recapture that kindergarten vibe.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.220]   And I'm sure that their teacher had the same thing.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.220]   They're very disruptive.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.860]   Sergey is very disruptive in class.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.060]   He's a very disruptive kid.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.700]   Yeah, it's...
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.100]   All right.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.100]   It is strange.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.100]   It's a new logo.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.100]   It's a new logo.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.700]   The one interesting thing to say is it does feel like they're trying to be a little bit
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.540]   softer and gentler.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.540]   Oh, sure.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.260]   As they conquer the world.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.380]   They actually posted something at design.google.com.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.940]   Thank you, Latif in the chat room.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.020]   I mean, if you have that up on the screen while you're taking testimony from Larry Page
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.340]   on or Sundar Prashay, his...
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.740]   Their plans to conquer the world.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.660]   It's like, "Us conquer the world?"
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.660]   No, no.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.660]   It's preschool.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.740]   Designers from all across the country.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.460]   I'm sorry, the company, including Creative Lab and the Material Design Team, convened
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.180]   early this year in New York for an intense week.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.540]   I mean, you think we spent a long time talking about it.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.300]   Week-long design sprint.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.540]   We drafted a brief that had F-I had four challenges.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.540]   A scalable mark.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.540]   There you go.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.220]   And I agree that could convey the feeling of the full logo type in small spaces.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.020]   The incorporation of dynamic, intelligent motion.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.180]   It responded to users at all stages of an interaction.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.540]   A systematic approach to branding in our products to provide consistency in people's daily encounters
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.540]   with Google.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.900]   A refinement of what makes us googly.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.700]   Combining the best of the brand our users know and love with thoughtful consideration
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.060]   for how their needs are changing.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.740]   This is designer speak.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.740]   Oh, boy.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.740]   Is it?
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.740]   There's always verbs.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.180]   Oh, standing through those meetings is just torture.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.460]   And I love designers.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.460]   I really do.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.460]   I really do.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.900]   And I wish I had your taste.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.260]   But normal people hear this stuff and they go, "What?"
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.020]   You know, the funny thing about these, and again, I've been in a bunch of meetings where
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.860]   you design a logo or something like that.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:16.140]   And the best idea comes and then you move past it and onto the bad idea, always.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.900]   I don't know why that is.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.140]   Well, when I started E.W.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.140]   The magazine came out.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:30.300]   The magazine came out and I had it offended, but the truth was the design sucked badly.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.260]   And I didn't know that I was a first time editor.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.940]   You let a design department keep futzing and they will keep futzing and futzing and futzing
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.620]   and futzing until it's over-futched.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:46.220]   And that's the natural process of design is to overdo things.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.620]   Here's another quote, "The Google logo has always had a simple, friendly and approachable
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.620]   style.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.340]   We wanted to retain these qualities by combining the mathematical purity of geometric forms."
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.460]   You know, it's definitely very circles and straight line.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:07.860]   With the childlike simplicity of schoolbook letter printing, childlike, who put-
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.420]   You wouldn't sue a little kid.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.500]   Who put that verb in their minds, childlike?
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.180]   Do you think Larry or somebody said, "You know, if you could make it childlike, you
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:22.780]   know, that's not something a company, a massive multi-billion dollar multinational usually
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.980]   says, 'What do we want to do as childlike?'"
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.940]   Apple would never think that way.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.820]   Apple would be like, "You want to transcend?"
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.940]   But besides the jokes about, you know, you're not going to kick a child in Europe, there
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:45.140]   is something to say that childlike is a universality and an innocence and a simplicity.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:50.340]   And, you know, it's not wrong.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.340]   Typography.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.580]   Primary color is a loan.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.580]   Get that across.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.060]   Yep.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.180]   We created a custom geometric sans serif typeface to complement the logo and product look-up,
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.820]   lock-ups and supporting identity materials.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.780]   We call it product sans.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.940]   The typeface design takes cues from that same schoolbook letter printing style, but it
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.620]   stops the neutral consistency we've all come to expect.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.380]   Haven't we all come to expect neutral consistency from geometric sans serif?
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.380]   I have.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.380]   Yes.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.380]   I have.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.380]   This allows us to maintain a neutral-
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.660]   It's not a word they should be using.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.180]   Neutral consistency allows us to maintain an appropriate level of distinction between
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.540]   the Google logo type and the product name.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.540]   Interesting.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:37.300]   So they're really, I mean, they've spent a lot of energy on the dots and the G.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.540]   You know, we're all talking about the word Google, but that's not, you know, the most
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.540]   important part of the thing.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.620]   It'll be interesting to see how they do animate it.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.620]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.060]   What they do with it?
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.060]   Oh, well.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.020]   What about the cost of doing this is?
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.100]   The design has to go into every single other division.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.100]   Sign it.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.100]   Physical signage.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.100]   It's not like changing Macy's logo.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.100]   Right.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.100]   Physical signage.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.100]   No mention that.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.100]   Remember, and this was many years ago, when Steve Jobs started, you know, the design
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.300]   started the company next.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.300]   He went to one of the most famous designers in the world, Paul Rand, to create the logo.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.300]   Rand said, "Here's the deal.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.300]   I'll do it for you, Steve.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.620]   It'll cost you $100,000.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.220]   You get no input and that's it.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.460]   I'll do something for you and that's what you get."
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.460]   Brilliant.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.580]   No changes, nothing.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.420]   So that was in 1986, $100,000.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.980]   It's got to be 10 times that.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.500]   And the logo sucked.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.700]   I like the next logo.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.700]   You don't like that?
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.700]   I don't like it.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.780]   The letters vanish into the thing.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.780]   It's forgettable, I think.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.780]   A cube?
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.140]   I mean, you kind of remember it was a cube, but I think it was more or less forgettable.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.420]   Somewhere I have the poster of that side by Paul Rand.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.420]   I've got to find that.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.420]   It's probably worth some.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.060]   It's so funny.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.220]   One of my earliest experiences with this sort of thing is we actually went, Windows Magazine,
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.860]   we launched with a Sarah font.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.220]   We ended up changing it to Sans Sarah font.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.700]   The Sarah font was designed by Milton Glazier.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.540]   It was one of the beautiful designers of all time.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.540]   Right?
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:12.660]   And then the publisher and some others decided that, no, we need a more contemporary look.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.500]   We don't want this thing.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.260]   And so the associate designer for one of the publications in this organization designed
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.780]   the Sans Sarah font, no, that's fine.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.780]   Go with it.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.540]   It's just, I don't know, it's like entropy.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.100]   Everything leads towards Sans Sarah of roundy fonts, I guess.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:35.740]   Well, I just opened a new tab and we went to Google and it's funny how it takes me back
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   for a second.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   It'll take about a week to get used to.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.740]   It does.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.620]   And even though it now is solid colors, it still feels like it's being drawn and chalked.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.620]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.780]   It really does have that kind of, it fades away or something.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.780]   It does.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.860]   And Milton looks at the capital G. I feel like the top should go over.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.860]   It's not finished.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.860]   It stops early.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:20:00.100]   It's premature, Ejakya, Gjakya, Lation.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.820]   And then the E, why is it pointed up?
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.820]   Where's it going?
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.820]   Looks like it wants to leave.
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:04.820]   I think the old one did too.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.460]   I wanted to go for a ride.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.540]   I'm out of here.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.620]   I remember when the fight was trying to pick the E, I don't have a weekly logo.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.140]   This is bringing back memories.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.980]   They picked a grotesque version of the font.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.460]   My reaction is an amateur.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.100]   Well, yeah, it looks grotesque.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.020]   That's a technical term.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.620]   You know, it's so funny because when I look at Twitter.tv, I really know for a while
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.580]   we get it from typography.com.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.980]   It's a net font.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.260]   For a while, we had trouble with it.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.420]   I think it defaults to Helvetica or something.
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.260]   I really didn't like it.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:44.260]   And then when I found out how much verlag was going to cost us, I asked the designer,
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.220]   "Hey, isn't there a free font that looks at it?"
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.060]   And he said, "Well, there's this."
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.220]   And I really didn't like it.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.980]   It's very subtle, but there's just something I love for a log.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.780]   I think that is a gorgeous font.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.100]   And it really, it says something.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.860]   But a choice of typeface does really communicate.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.860]   It really does.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.860]   Yep.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.860]   Oddly enough.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.860]   Yep.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.260]   I mean, think about the most...
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.700]   Look, think about the Apple website, for example, or all the logos you've seen in the
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.700]   year or the...
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.700]   You know, some of the...
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.700]   Yeah, there was some discussion earlier about the original NASA logo from the '70s and '80s.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.700]   Yeah, don't ever change that.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700]   Oh, it's brilliant.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.700]   It's brilliant.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.700]   It looks like a...
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.020]   There was a little discussion on my Facebook page about what companies have not changed
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.020]   there.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.020]   Mm.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.020]   Logo.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.540]   Somebody said Coca-Cola, but that's changed appreciably over time.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.540]   I was told by Ford that the Ford, the script Ford in the Blue Oval, is Henry Ford's handwriting.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.540]   Wow.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.980]   So I think that has not changed.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.980]   Hm.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.380]   In some time.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.460]   Is it ever a piece or...
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.460]   Mr.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.460]   Robot...
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.460]   It's really...
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.180]   People are pointing out that in Mr. Robot the Evil Corp, that is the company that is the
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.500]   center of that.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.660]   It's called E-Corp.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.220]   Has the same logo as Enron, which it does.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.860]   Nice.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.900]   So that's a good choice.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.460]   Why does this?
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.460]   I don't know what this is.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.820]   That is a large evil corporation.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.900]   That was not evil.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.420]   This is evil corp.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.420]   There it is.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   E-Corp.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.420]   All right.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.420]   We have now...
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.860]   Well, we have one more note on this.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.860]   Okay.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.860]   We have not...
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.860]   Yes.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.220]   We have the fact that the search box is bigger.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.220]   What?
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.220]   Do you notice that?
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.220]   You noticed that, Danny.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.020]   Oh, I didn't notice that.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.060]   But Barry Schwartz, our fine standing news editor, notices these things.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.020]   And the microphone is in color now.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.020]   I noticed that.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.020]   On Android as well.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.220]   Probably does some animation if you speak.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.780]   Yeah, if you follow that link, it goes and animation, showing the difference in size, precisely
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.780]   Danny.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.780]   You know your stuff well.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.740]   And you know that when you hover over, I'm feeling lucky.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.740]   I forgot about all that.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.740]   The change is into something weird.
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.740]   I mean, you can't...
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.740]   It's interesting though, because it is really rare that I actually go to the Google homepage.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.740]   Right.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.740]   Whoever sees this anyway.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.740]   Right.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.740]   But people do.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.660]   I mean, you know, people do, but it is, you know, so much of a change where if you're
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.740]   on your phone, I'm just searching in the omnibox or, oh, I love that one.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.740]   That one's a great logo.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.740]   Tom Sawyer.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:22.700]   If, you know, or if you are, you know, you're speaking to it or you're in Chrome on the desktop,
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.180]   or you know, even if you're using Safari, you're not going to the Google homepage, you
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.580]   know, unless you type it specifically.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.900]   I think most of the people going to the Google homepage are the people who are using, you
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.340]   know, being and they type in Google.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.340]   You're probably right.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.180]   Some people probably, I would guess, set this as their default homepage in their browser,
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.180]   right?
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.180]   They could.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.900]   Although it's interesting, if you were going to have a homepage as default, I mean, being
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.060]   is a beautiful homepage.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.060]   Much nicer.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.420]   I'm going to be showing you different images that are out there.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   Right.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.780]   They've really, it's really well done.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.700]   And you can even, now there's sound on the, on the homepage so you can hear.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.700]   Where are we at today?
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.380]   This is in Iceland.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.380]   I think I would benefit that.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.620]   Stroker geyser.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.980]   I was just there.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.980]   Wow.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.980]   They knew.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.980]   I was there like three months ago.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:11.980]   I see you know Danny Sullivan.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.460]   I thought it looked real clear.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.540]   Perhaps you'd like to see.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.260]   Except my view had a lot of people holding selfie sticks.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.260]   Oh, God.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:28.660]   No, I, I, so that's actually interesting that you say this Danny because this is a remarkable
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.620]   alternative to Google, which is notorious for a simple, clean design.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.940]   Fast, fast, fast, fast, and even after Marissa Meyer left, they, you know, kept it as simple
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.020]   as possible.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.220]   And you could not get more diametrically opposed.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.140]   This is come.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.540]   This is, they've got a video of the big page with audio.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.420]   And news stories and suggested searches.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.860]   And there's even these little highlights that load.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.860]   I don't know.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.100]   You know, what's amazing is it does load fairly fast.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.100]   Yep.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:07.220]   It must have been pre loading all day.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.020]   You don't think I doubt Microsoft spent any time on the Bing logo at all.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.940]   Well, I actually know that don't you remember it was about a year ago that Microsoft went
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.140]   through this huge rebranding.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.140]   Oh.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.380]   And they had a very long documentation.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.260]   This is why all of our stuff comes together.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.460]   This is how our angles all come together.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.060]   And that Bing logo, I think, came in as part of the same kind of rebranding that they did
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.260]   for some of the other Microsoft stuff at the time.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.100]   I just think it's amazing.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.100]   They have a geyser erupting.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.180]   Yeah, you got to be careful where you said around there.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.780]   This is going to, in a few years, going to look very dated.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.780]   Isn't it this page?
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.780]   Maybe not.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.780]   I don't know.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.740]   Well, the images don't get dated.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.740]   It's beautiful.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.740]   Actually, I love it.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.540]   And then the logo, of course, did change.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.420]   I've got, you know, it made all my other Bing stuff outdated.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.420]   Right.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.820]   I've been on a Bing snowboard and now my logo on it doesn't matter.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.180]   Oh, man, you're Bing snowboard.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.180]   Where is it?
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.180]   You're in a different room today.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.180]   I'm in a different house.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.180]   Are other houses having some construction?
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.180]   Oh, no.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.180]   We've got to go out.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.180]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, your other house?
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.180]   I'm in a laundry.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.180]   Well, not our other house.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.540]   I mean, like, we're in a rented house.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.540]   Oh, OK.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.540]   Oh, OK.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.540]   Our summer house.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.540]   We're in the summer house.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.540]   Yeah, summer house.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.540]   Oh, that's had to do some stuff in the side.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.100]   No, we're in a rented house.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.220]   So I'm tucked away, actually, in a laundry room.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.660]   So how did Barry Schwartz know?
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.180]   I mean, did he measure?
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.860]   You know, you should have very on the show someday.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.860]   First, I'd love to.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.860]   I'd love to.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.860]   He'd be larger.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.860]   We have on T.L.T. all the time.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.860]   It's great.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.140]   My guess is he's probably saw somebody noted, although usually if he got it from somewhere,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.500]   someone will he'll credit it at the bottom of the page unless it's just a one.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.020]   It's just a wide spread that it's happening out there.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.700]   So he may have seen people saying, oh, my gosh, have you seen that the logos change?
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.180]   Because there's some people who really get into watching that sort of stuff.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.180]   He says.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.460]   But it's amazing because, you know, we go through the debates like, oh, you know, they
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.180]   made the search box longer.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.180]   Does anybody care?
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.180]   Or like, right?
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.180]   Or article?
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.180]   Like, yeah.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.180]   But you know, this is data driven.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.180]   There's a reason why they do that.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.140]   They're not just kind of, hey, let's add 33 more pixels to the-- I mean, there's-- they
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.140]   have data that tells them something.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:19.740]   You know, what they have done over time-- and in fact, I don't know if you recall, a few
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.420]   years ago, they got mocked for this.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.500]   And I can't remember who did it.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.700]   It might have been Steve Jobs where they enlarged the search box.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.780]   And someone made fun of them like, and what do they do?
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.060]   They made their search box better.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.740]   But then again, you know, they're a search company.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.780]   I understand people like to type in there and you like to have room to type.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.780]   I hate this, though.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.340]   Is this normal behavior?
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.540]   So I've got the full page.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.340]   I start typing something.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.340]   The full--
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.340]   Yeah, that's-- that jumps up to the top.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.340]   I hate that.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.340]   Who does that?
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.340]   That's Google Instant.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.340]   That's instant.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.340]   Google Instant.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.340]   That stinks.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.180]   Well, but if you want to get to stuff after you might not.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.340]   They're trying-- you know what they're trying to do?
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.340]   Get you used to typing the top of the screen.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.340]   So you stopped going to the Google front page.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:03.940]   The best thing, Lee, and I don't really want to get a real criminology here.
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:09.500]   Notice, thanks to Demi's staff's animation, that shopping and news have changed position.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.500]   Oh.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   That's interesting.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   Mm.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   By the way, what is a hover-out?
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.500]   Oh, by the way, what is a hover-bose?
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.060]   Shout out to the other side.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.180]   And why is that a great question, Otto and Delete?
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.940]   What is the best hover-bose?
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.420]   Why is a typo in the instant search results?
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.820]   And who is Mr. Robot?
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.580]   What is my IP and who is Mr. Robot?
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.020]   Wow.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.420]   Those are something I must have searched for, right?
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.980]   I'm surprised it's preserving the typo.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.380]   Where's-- I don't even see a shopping in--
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.380]   No, no.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.980]   If you go back to Demi's thing.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.980]   OK.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.100]   I would, but I don't really care.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.580]   Let's move on.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.500]   I'm a bad, bad man.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.060]   So Google has-- actually, this is a good one for you, Demi.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:09.420]   Google and Firefox have teamed up to deprecate Flash as of this month.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.420]   Great.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:18.660]   As of yesterday, Flash will not auto-play in Chrome.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.700]   If you got the new Chrome 45, which came out yesterday--
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.140]   now, fortunately, if you go to our live page, it does auto-play.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.340]   So they say less important content.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.340]   What they don't want to say is that's ads.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.180]   That's ads.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:32.680]   Exactly.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.180]   Right.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:33.380]   It is.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.140]   Ads in related junk.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.420]   It also has to be said that Amazon also, in addition to Google
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.180]   and others, have banned it.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.940]   Band Flash ads throughout Amazon.com.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.220]   Not that they have a lot of ads, but they do have them.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.620]   They are tend to be Flash.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:54.260]   Part of this comes from the fact that the MSN and Yahoo
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:00.060]   have both had malicious malware ads that were based on Flash
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.860]   that infected some people's computers if they hadn't updated their Flash.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.260]   Google has also changed the default behavior in Settings now.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:13.020]   It used to say, under Plugins in the content section of your settings on Chrome,
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.460]   run all plug-in content.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.580]   The default now is detect and run important plug-in content.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.340]   So you can change that behavior.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.620]   What defines important?
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.100]   Google.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.100]   How is that determined?
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.460]   But how is that determined?
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.620]   That's why I couldn't figure out.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.060]   Google figures all that stuff out.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.820]   You don't need to worry your pre-a little headpad.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.380]   It's important.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.340]   So you don't have to.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:38.980]   I think they didn't want to say ads.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.020]   I was pleased that-- well, let's say CNN does a lot of Flash, right?
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.220]   Let's see if CNN stuff runs.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.740]   I don't know if they have autoplay.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.660]   And maybe they don't.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.020]   But if I go to twit.tv/live, that starts and plays.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.660]   So obviously, we're important.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.700]   So it's not turning off all Flash.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.940]   That's Flash.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.220]   And it runs.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:05.420]   So it's not turning off all Flash, but it is turning off Flash ads.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.060]   Oh, I know why.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.780]   I should turn off--
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.220]   I've got U-block origin running.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:15.260]   That's really changing my experience of the web for the better.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.620]   Danny, you look good in the little window there.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.620]   Oh, thank you.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.900]   Thank you in the little window.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.900]   Hello.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.300]   He's in the little window within the little window.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.020]   I try to get buried.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.980]   He gave me some more information on that navigation.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.980]   By the way.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.900]   Oh, good.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.700]   If he reports back to me--
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.660]   what I was noticing to go back to it
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.500]   is that the navigation actually seemed to be dynamic now.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.380]   So for example, if you search for--
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.540]   search for cars.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.700]   Me and my cars.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.260]   And then what navigation do you have there?
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.980]   Click off the search box.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.820]   So I can see the links at the bottom.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.180]   Yeah, how are you rid of that?
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.620]   Just click anywhere on the page.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.300]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.300]   This is terrible.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.300]   Press harder.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.300]   That worked.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.460]   Let's do that again.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.460]   Cars.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.460]   I think you blew out your touchpad.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.460]   Then do what?
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.460]   Hit enter.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.460]   There you go.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.460]   See these web images, videos, and you stop--
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.460]   There it is.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.460]   Here's where we're shopping.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.460]   Now change cars.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.460]   Add the word DVD to cars.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.460]   Now, click Cars DVD.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.460]   Oh.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.020]   Yeah, well, anyway, you'll see it.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.820]   If you do Cars DVD, then I bet shopping jumps up to the second.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.820]   It does.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.820]   What the-- what the-- what?
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.340]   Oh, because I can buy now the cars DVD.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.900]   Oh, Barry's already come back.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.900]   That is very old.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.900]   Oh, that's very old.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:38.900]   That's very cool.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:39.900]   It's been doing that for ages.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.900]   There we are.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.340]   But I'm doing that forever.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.340]   It's just-- you know what?
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.900]   But that really raises the very important point that we don't notice these things.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.900]   Nope.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.900]   But I bet you it changes our behavior.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.740]   Bet you a bunch.
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:03.060]   So you can-- don't have to worry about starting up the video.
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:07.300]   YouTube has started in January, abandoned flash.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.020]   HTML5 is default.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.900]   Flash ads in February, Google started converting flash ads to HTML5.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.900]   Good.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.660]   You know, this is just following along with an apple.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.660]   Is there an over under here on the-- on the-- on the death of flash?
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.660]   Well, flash completely died.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.300]   I mean, why use flash?
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.700]   We still use it because our providers-- I mean, we don't use it.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.700]   But Ustream uses it and BitGravity uses it for playback.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:36.340]   I would expect that Ustream now has a fallback to non-flash.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.540]   So if you come to it on an Android device, it will fall back to HTTP streaming.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.700]   According to adage, 84% of banner ads are still flash.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.420]   Oh, geez.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.500]   Well, it's too-- I think it's almost too late.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:55.860]   But that's-- I mean, when people say, oh, when adage, in fact, says, oh my god, ad blocking
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.780]   is costing the industry billions of dollars, you should have thought of that before you
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.940]   started 80% flash ads on us.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.940]   That's the subject of my column.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.340]   Unfortunately, it's not-- today, it'll be out tomorrow in the observer.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.300]   But just arguing that the basic message of all this ad blocking is talking-- stuff we
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.180]   talked about last week is that-- is that all the things that are wrong with advertising
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.780]   and we have to rethink-- just like we have to rethink media, we have to rethink advertising
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.780]   funding and all that.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.220]   Yeah, what I'm forced to because people aren't going to see your ad--
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.220]   Exactly.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   This is what I love about--
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   --now in charge.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.540]   Yeah, this is what I love about this whole thing.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.100]   The reason everybody's quickly, suddenly, finally embracing the abandonment of flash
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.980]   is because of ad blockers.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:37.860]   People are saying, OK, these ads are so problematic, I'm just done with all of them.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.620]   And so the company is like Google who live and die by ads are like, wait a minute, wait
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.020]   a minute, we've got to do something about this.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:50.100]   And also, yeah, I'm sure that Jeff, you're calling on everyone to embrace Silverlight
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.100]   as an alternative.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.980]   Even Microsoft has deprecated Silverlight.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.980]   Yes.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.980]   They should throw that in the bin.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.300]   But you could do everything you do with Flash now.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.700]   You could do with CSS or Java stuff.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.700]   You don't need it.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.500]   Let me all animate a gift so all the ways to--
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   Right.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   That's OK with me.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:15.140]   Those can't infect you until there's a problem with the animated gift library on your platform.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.300]   Yeah, so I'm glad.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:23.100]   I think Flash-- I think by the end of this year-- no, maybe by the end of 2017, you won't
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.100]   see any Flash around.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.340]   I'm surprised to have taken it this long.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.340]   I am true.
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:34.500]   And ever since they dropped it off of iOS, it's been-- that's years old at this point.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.820]   So ad blockers are about-- I mean, we're about to hit adblock hoplips.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.300]   Which I, by the way, was searching for a name.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.300]   Block hoplips.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.300]   Maybe.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.300]   No?
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:52.580]   We're going to hit it if people on iOS think it's worth going out of their way to downloading
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.900]   a third party thing to add into Safari.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.180]   You know, a lot of people should start going to be bothered to be--
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.180]   Do not go do it.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.380]   I mean, I think you've already do it on deathtop.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.780]   People don't really do it on deathtop.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.340]   I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it's there, but it has not been such an issue that
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.380]   the industry has said, wow, we've got to do something to stop this.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:16.500]   It's going to be easier to do it in your mobile browser.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.460]   It'll be interesting to see if people really do pick it up, but it's not-- if it were going
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.100]   to be on by default, that would be a much different story, but it's not on by default.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.260]   So you got to think, oh, I really want this.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.260]   Now I'm going to go get this.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.460]   Now I'm going to download an app from a third party.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.820]   Wait, who is this third party?
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.820]   Do I trust this third party?
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.460]   Do I want to use the third party?
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.220]   Are some third party ad locker at some point is going to turn out to be tracking you as
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.340]   they delete the thing, which is going to freak people out even more?
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.700]   So you know, but if it did get that way and it suddenly everybody turns out today--
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.980]   But what if it-- I don't think it'll ever be, you know, everybody.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.620]   But what if 25% of your revenue disappeared?
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.620]   That would be significant.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.620]   Sure.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.180]   If 25% of your revenue disappears because all the ads are really getting blocked in that
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.180]   way, what you're going to find out happens in my view is native ads could explode even
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.180]   more.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.180]   You're going to have the ads that you can get involved.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.180]   You'll find other ways to do it.
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.380]   Right, which is exactly the problem.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.380]   Right.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.940]   You need to have to-- I mean, ironically, it's going to make it worse.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.460]   It makes it much worse.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.300]   Or people will be asked to pay for content more than they do now.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.220]   And maybe they probably won't.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.980]   And content will die.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.980]   And sites will die.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.980]   Right.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.980]   They're already dying.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.820]   Yeah, I think we'll see that happen.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.020]   And there's an argument to make, not to plug myself in the observant, but wrote a column
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.740]   that when thousands of people write the same stupid blue moon story, when there's nothing
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.060]   actually new about the moon, it showed we're a terribly wasteful industry.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.020]   There's plenty more efficiency to be found.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.580]   Maybe we have too much content.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.860]   It was the argument about television.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.460]   We have too much television content.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.460]   That's right.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.180]   It was just an argument going around this week.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.580]   And I can't remember who started it, but saying, you know, we have too much good TV.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.580]   Right.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.940]   Well, that's not a problem for us in the audience, but it is a problem for those making it that
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.540]   they can't get their attention up to the levels they needed.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.540]   But we've got a great--
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.020]   It's the New York Times, by the way.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.020]   Yes, thank you.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.540]   I forget who-- what it was--
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.180]   Is John Koblin, soul searching in the TV land over the challenges of the new Golden
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.540]   Age where everybody agrees we're in a Golden Age of television, except--
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.860]   There's so much on television.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.100]   A glut.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:22.420]   This was a guy, Mr.-- let's see, John Landgraf of FX Networks.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:27.300]   He said at the Television Critics Association media event, "It's hard to cut through the
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.900]   clutter and create real bluzz and has presented a huge challenge in finding compelling original
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:36.260]   stories and the level of talent needed to sustain those stories with the apples of that."
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:42.460]   Yeah, it's really hard for Hollywood to try to figure out how to find original stories.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.460]   I mean--
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.460]   Apparently it is.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:50.180]   If you can just go to-- I don't know-- Amazon and look at the thousands of individual authors
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.020]   that are putting stuff out there.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.420]   I don't think-- I don't know on an extra Hollywood, but your glut on finding original
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.420]   stories is that you don't like risk.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.420]   Right.
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.420]   That's right.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.420]   And so what's better for you to do is to have another hundred shows about--
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.220]   Maybe a cop drama.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.180]   But let's set it in Miami.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.180]   Ooh.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.180]   Or--
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.180]   How many CISs are there?
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.140]   I think if they wanted original stuff, they could totally have all the original stuff they
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.500]   want if they're willing to take the risk.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   Right.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.500]   But they're not willing to take the risk.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.500]   So--
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.940]   You think there's-- OK, so there's enough writers.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.820]   Is there enough-- are there enough actors?
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.820]   And maybe--
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:27.820]   I used to live in LA.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.820]   There are plenty of actors.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.060]   Every restaurant waiter is an actor.
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.420]   I'm just going to serve us at the rest of the day.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.420]   Exactly.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.860]   The question is, are there enough Jennifer Lawrence's that we can put into our original
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.020]   stuff because that might help.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:43.940]   But yeah, there's probably a lack of superstars that I want to do things.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.060]   But gosh, you know, it's wonderful when you watch--
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:51.380]   What we just had the some kind of hero or show me a hero that was on HBO.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.380]   And like--
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.380]   The actors-- I didn't even know.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.380]   No.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.380]   They were great.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.380]   And it was fresh.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.380]   And you're like, wow, this is like a whole new actor that I've been--
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.580]   I think the story of the redevelopment of Yonkers is gripping.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.580]   Well, I mean--
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.580]   Well, I could have been--
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.580]   Really?
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.580]   Did you like that show?
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.580]   It was interesting.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.580]   OK.
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.620]   I tried to watch it.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.620]   I really did.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   I wanted to love it.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.220]   It was-- it really probably only needed about half that length.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.220]   I know.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.580]   But there is great stuff out there.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.860]   But I can also see-- the glut really isn't so much.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.140]   There's a lack of performers and writers.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.380]   The glut is that there's a lack of attention.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:33.780]   There's only some-- I mean, I already, in my household, Lisa's saying, let's not start
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.780]   another show.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:35.780]   Yeah, for the fact.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.780]   I don't want to start another show.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.000]   By the way, did you know they're making a TV series about Minority Report?
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.020]   You gotta see it, Lisa.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.020]   I saw that.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.500]   You're going to start watching.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.020]   You're going to start watching better.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.540]   It's going to improve the quality because you're going to select better.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.540]   Right.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.540]   Well, but--
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.540]   I don't know.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.540]   --the real problem.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.540]   Here's the real problem.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.980]   It's the siloed.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.840]   So Apple's going to have their eye content, so you've got to have that, and then you have
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.380]   to have HBO, and you have to have Netflix, and you have to have Amazon because they're
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.180]   doing their own content.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.040]   I think the opposite thing is happening where you realize it's just as with news content,
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.140]   you have to be everywhere, you have to put your-- you're going to have to put an instant
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.060]   article is going to be on Facebook.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.780]   Same here, producers are going to have to be everywhere.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.780]   Granted, Netflix--
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.780]   No, but that's about it.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.780]   --is not going to differentiate themselves.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.140]   The model is different now because Apple's paying for this content and Netflix is paying
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.940]   for this kind of Amazon's paying for this kind of--
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.140]   To give them an exclusive.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.140]   Exactly.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.140]   That's the whole point.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.140]   So I have to have HBO.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.140]   I have to have Amazon.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.140]   I have to have Netflix.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.140]   I have to have Netflix.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.140]   I have to work for--
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.780]   That's just an evolution of the cable model we're already with, right?
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.780]   Yes.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.280]   I watch TV, and I say I want to have these channels because I want to know I want that
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   kind of content.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.520]   So my modern cable channel these days is I have Hulu.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   I have Netflix.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.520]   I have Amazon.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.360]   But the difference is that cable didn't have great content.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.360]   What's that?
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.360]   They'd crap, mostly.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   Well, but HBO is--
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.840]   The Fish and Channel and stuff like that.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.840]   Showtime HBO.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.340]   No, but they have--
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.340]   AMC.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:03.880]   A modern cable system for me would be actually-- I don't get this stuff through direct TV,
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:11.560]   but maybe I buy my bundle where I've got an Apple and Netflix, the Amazon or whatever.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.160]   I've built it up that way.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.560]   So maybe I'm paying my $40 per month, which is what I was doing with cable in the first
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   place.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.560]   I'm not getting everything on one single channel.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.560]   Right.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   I don't get that now.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.920]   But isn't there a FOMO problem too that, oh, I don't have Cinemax.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.160]   I'm not going to see the Nick.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.160]   Yes, there is.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   Fure of Earth.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   Sure.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.760]   Well, you saw-- you started typing in what is, and it said, what is Mr. Robot?
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.320]   People are hearing about Mr. Robot, and they don't even know where it is, where to find
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   it.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   That's a very good point.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   That's the new problem.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   And that's great for Google because they have a search engine.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.480]   I got a call last night from Comcast.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   Oh, no.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   And then we're going to take a break.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.480]   I know.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   Oh, no.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.480]   I shouldn't have answered it.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.880]   I knew it was a spam call.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.560]   And they wanted somebody to triple-play package.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:02.240]   And I said, well, I already have Comcast business class, and I want to keep that so I won't
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.560]   be buying the internet.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.040]   And I don't have a phone line.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.520]   We use a cell phone, so I won't be buying the phone.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.160]   And he's still trying to sell it to me.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.000]   He said, but you'll save money if you have a triple-play.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.200]   I said, but I save money now because I don't have a phone at all.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:21.020]   He said, yes, but even if you don't use the phone and the extra internet, it will still
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.680]   be less if you buy this package.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   It's just such a ridiculous--
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   It's--
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   They're insane.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.760]   Finally, I had to yell at him and say goodbye.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   The airlines are like that.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   The airlines are like that.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.040]   It'll cost you $350 to fly to Dallas.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   A lot.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.840]   $200 to fly to connect in Dallas on the way to Miami.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:46.720]   I said, even if this is a call to sell me triple-play, I don't want it.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.520]   I can't use it because I--
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.200]   And of course, I know that it starts low.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.640]   I said, but how long is that price?
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.920]   Two years.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   And then--
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.920]   And then you're stuck.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.920]   Behavioral economics.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.920]   Right.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:07.720]   But if I could get a good clearing house, it somehow let me buy five things in one go.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.280]   I mean, it's not going to happen, but--
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.560]   It isn't because it's not in the interest of the creators.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.160]   Well, I'm sorry, the creators is in their interest.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.640]   It's not in the interest of the people who fund the creators.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:26.360]   Yeah, but if someone can sell a Hulu subscription to someone else who wasn't even thinking about
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.760]   buying it because they will buy it if they can bundle it up with something else, Hulu
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.800]   makes them more money off of that, even if they didn't sell it direct.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:38.840]   It says, you know, in the music industries moving towards this model of selling direct,
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.680]   basically artists go direct to their audience.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:45.240]   What did the record labels really add to the next accept, you know, boy bands?
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.880]   Yeah, when you become known-- I mean, there's a few ways to go here.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.480]   This is what I argue-- what I call into Howard Stern, and I say, why are you sharing your
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.640]   money with Sirius?
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:57.440]   You should have your own empire, only 100% on your own online, and you can do that.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.800]   Now, can Joe Schmoke and the 12-year-old Howard Stern, if they do that?
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   No.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.000]   Howard argues in return, you've got to go to broadcast.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.800]   You've got to be on broadcast like that.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.080]   And I yell at him and say, you know, he'll make something else to broadcast.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   Exactly what I said.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.640]   I said, Howard, you're the one who ruined broadcast.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   You're the last one, Howard.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.440]   You're the one who killed it.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   And now he--
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.840]   That's exactly what he said.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.240]   That's exactly what Jeff said.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.440]   You pulled up the ladder.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.040]   But there are models that start to go where you start up and you build.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:30.800]   And this is why VidCon was so amazing to me is that you can build an audience.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.120]   Kickstarter is not the answer for everybody, but when you do get to be known, the question
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.640]   is where does the risk capital come from for entertainment?
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.920]   That's the real issue here.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   Precisely.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.400]   Right now, you have the big money player.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.960]   If you want to make a blockbuster, you want to make something big that's going to be expensive
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.440]   to make, you're going to have to go to somebody who's willing to make the risk capital upfront,
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.840]   and that's going to be Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple networks.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.840]   True.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.000]   But if you want to make something cute and funny and you want to make the daily show tomorrow,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.360]   you don't necessarily need that risk capital.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   You can just do that.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.440]   And if you're good enough, you can build an audience and you can get going.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.920]   And if the engine starts cranking, great.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.080]   If it doesn't, well, throw it overboard and start the next thing.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.440]   If we move to-- it's the blockbuster economy.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   As long as we're a blockbuster economy, which some part of entertainment always will be
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.840]   because the returns are so magnificent if you hit it, then yes, risk capital matters.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.040]   But a lot more entertainment is going to go to less and less risk capital.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.440]   That's a lot cheaper to make this thing.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.800]   And what proves that?
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.160]   This very show.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.640]   I didn't follow that, but it sounded good at the end.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640]   Yeah, that was a great ending.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.720]   But you're absolutely right about that.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:39.360]   But I also think that shows-- I mean, there are multiple models.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.640]   There's the VC model where the money-- and it doesn't matter where the money's coming
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:48.320]   from-- goes out in funds, content creators, right?
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.800]   And then there's the other model where they hire people and to develop content.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.480]   The first model is a total winner.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.600]   Like everybody-- you talk about you bootstrap it on your own.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.600]   You don't even have to do that.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.840]   You can be like an app developer and you can go to a VC Netflix or whatever it is.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.000]   Do you really even need a VC?
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.240]   Do you need that risk capital?
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.720]   I mean, most of the stuff my kid watches is-- there's no-- there's no investment involved.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.440]   I think of Epic Meal Time.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.800]   Those guys, basically, they buy a couple of dozen donuts and they're fixed and they shoot
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   it.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   Yeah, yep.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.960]   And that's another question, of course.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.080]   It's scaring the hell out of the TV folks and the content creators and the content distributors
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:36.520]   is what is the younger 25 set doing and how do we reach them?
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.520]   Nobody knows.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.600]   They're too busy broadcasting, so you went off the other edge.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.600]   Right.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   Right.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.280]   Did you say, Jeff, I think you said this last week that every industry just says, well,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.920]   they'll grow into it.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.200]   Once-- wait until they get to be older and then they'll watch-- then they'll be watching
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   the Murf Griffin show.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.240]   You'll be driving a Buick.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.080]   No, I don't think so.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.960]   Don't think so.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.160]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.800]   If you do want to start a business, you absolutely can do it.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.200]   I really think you'd can, but there are a few little teas you need to cross, eyes you
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.600]   need to dot.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.440]   You need to get some legal work done, but you don't have to have a lawyer to do it.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.520]   For more than a decade, LegalZoom has shown people that they can start a business.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.760]   They can protect their family.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.720]   They can confidently navigate the legal system without a law firm.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.720]   See, LegalZoom's not a law firm.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.360]   That's why they're so affordable.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.760]   They don't charge you by the hour.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.680]   Instead, you get transparent fixed prices, customer reviews.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.000]   You know what you're getting up front.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.240]   So you're incorporating, creating an LLC.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.240]   That's what I did.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.680]   Couldn't have been easier with LegalZoom and more affordable.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.440]   I mean, it was so affordable.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:55.720]   Trade marks, last wheels, living trusts, LegalZoom is the smart choice.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.440]   And this is something that they didn't have when I used them 10 years ago, but they do
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.440]   now.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:05.160]   If you need legal advice, they have prearranged, pre-negotiated fees with a network of independent
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.680]   attorneys who can give you straightforward guidance at a fee.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   You know ahead of time.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.680]   You know what's going to cost.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   That's not much.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:19.840]   Don't let LegalZoom become an excuse for you living your dream, protecting your family.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.200]   Go to LegalZoom.com today.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.360]   Start building your future the right way.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.520]   You can do it yourself.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   A little bit of help from LegalZoom.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.280]   LegalZoom.com, by the way, if you use the offer code twig, it check out.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.480]   You'll save a little bit.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.800]   And they'll know that you heard it on this week in Google and we'd appreciate that.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:47.560]   I love the conversations we have on this show.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:51.200]   It's, you know, when you don't understand what I'm saying.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   I was being facetious.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   I know you were.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   I know the whole the whole issue of the cost of creating content is very interesting because
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.160]   you still probably contest one of the few areas.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.800]   You know, you could start a blog and write every single word you write, Jeff.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.960]   You could do all by yourself.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.280]   You don't need a venture fund to do it.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.040]   But media, television and movies, we haven't figured a way to do that for nothing.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   Yep.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.040]   Not high quality anyway.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.520]   No, but a talk show used to be very expensive.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.520]   This is cheap.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   You were on a network that did it.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.400]   You know, you just ask me a question.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:30.040]   Do you ever in a cold sweat, you know, when you open the new studio and spend all that
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   money or those things, do you ever say, I wish I'd stayed one show and I'd have no obligations
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   to anybody.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.920]   Every freaking day.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:45.880]   No, I actually really like what we built, but I am very cognizant of the fact that it's,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.880]   you know what?
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.200]   This is a conundrum for me because it costs me millions of dollars a year to run a larger
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.280]   operation than just me and this nice studio and all this stuff.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.400]   But on the other hand, would I get that same income that I get if I, you know, I don't
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:05.080]   know if I don't know if shutting it or squeezing it down to a smaller size would give me that
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.960]   $2 million a year extra in my pocket.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.960]   I don't think it would.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.680]   And the reason you, and you could grow even bigger if you'd taken capital and the reason
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.160]   well, we could grow faster.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.640]   I don't know if it would be the right kind of growth.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.560]   I look at, you know, revision three is the example for me of that.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   They got $8 million in venture funding, spend it all very quickly on studios and talent
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.960]   and acquiring things that didn't work.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.600]   And we have a discipline of having to do, you know, we can only buy what we can afford.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.680]   That's what I was writing about earlier this year when the whole giga thing happened, the
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:43.560]   idea that the SimCity model of building, but you know, you build up to your budget or whatever.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.560]   And yeah, it's a difference.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.320]   And to go to the video thing, I mean, am I not remembering like Louis C. Kade funded
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   one of his own things?
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.640]   Because he said you donate the $5.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.960]   You can do it.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.360]   And it's certainly a lot easier if you want to do it as an individual and you're not trying
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.840]   to build out something that you hope you're going to sell to another person or that you
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.840]   know, are expecting to get a capital payoff from it.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.000]   You just want to be individual.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.160]   But stand up comedy is cheap.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:12.120]   I mean, Game of Thrones, there's no way you make Game of Thrones for less than a million
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.760]   or two, an episode, right?
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.680]   Somebody's got to come up with that million or two, an episode.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.120]   Yeah, but potentially you could still do it.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.800]   You could find other ways of funding it.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.240]   It's just that you could find other ways of funding it.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:28.880]   It's just that the ways of funding it right now are very efficient and they're all institutionalized.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   Here's the question.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.080]   If suddenly you couldn't, if you suddenly couldn't get ads subscription revenue, you'd
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.480]   find another way to do stuff.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.000]   I don't think it would disappear.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Right.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   So Danny, let me ask you this.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.360]   We had just because you follow this.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.920]   Some all three of you follow so much.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.600]   What if venture capital started to come in?
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.200]   And here's what I mean by this.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.400]   If you took away the need for distribution partnerships, if you said you really could
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:55.080]   distribute on your own, you call YouTube not even distribution partnership, just a channel
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.920]   of sale and distribution, right?
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.440]   You don't need to do it to get bought by.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.520]   You don't need to get green lit by a major studio or a major network.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   Right.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.520]   Let's just imagine that.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:12.760]   Then why wouldn't venture capital come into this business and say, "Can be a famous producer?"
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.240]   Well, I think they do.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   I think they do it in ways that we're not used to thinking about.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.240]   David Chase.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.120]   We love the sopranos so much.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.560]   We just believe in you, and we want you to make quite an extra difference.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.920]   But then here's a million dollars in episode, but that's what Netflix did.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.800]   They went to Dana, they went to Trick-er Street and said, "We love you, Kevin Spacey."
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.300]   Here's a hundred million dollars, "Make House of Cards."
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:39.760]   So one of somebody goes to Kevin Spacey or David Chase and says, "Here's the deal.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.120]   I will, don't split your revenue with anybody.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.920]   You just give me a payback at a time and you sell directly to the public.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.480]   You can charge on whatever you want.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.000]   You sell directly to the public.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.080]   You can just play platforms where you can do this.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.360]   I'll put up the money because I'm sure you're going to be a blockbuster."
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   Distribution is the issue right now, right?
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.920]   I'm just saying no, it's not.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.360]   It's not anymore.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.480]   You could put something up online.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.680]   You could put a freaking PayPal in front of it and you could charge people to watch what
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:11.160]   you want to show them and you could own the money completely.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.760]   But Jeff, the only place where that really happens is YouTube.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   You can talk about Louis EK.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.320]   You can talk about Howard Stern.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:23.280]   You can talk about all kinds of people, Kevin Spacey, who made it with the old model and
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.000]   who are household names because of the old model.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.840]   They can do it in the new way.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.760]   But the people didn't make it.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:37.200]   Again, PewDiePie and all those guys on YouTube are a differentiator, but they're not household
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.680]   names at all.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   You can build up your reputation in a lot of different ways, right?
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   You can do such.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.280]   What you said just said about YouTube?
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:50.200]   Google is the anti-Apple and the anti-Amazon and the anti-Netflix.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.880]   Google could say to any performer out there, and this is why I say this is why I introduced
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.360]   Stern's people to Google five years ago.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.920]   Google could say to any top performer out there today, however they made it with their
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.520]   reputation and find it, they made it in old ways because it was a transitional period.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.880]   But let's say you go to David Chase and you say, "Dave, babe, love you.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.240]   Love your stuff."
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:13.520]   Google says, "We have a standard cut that we'll take for distributing you or selling
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.520]   ads on your thing.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   You pick your model.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.520]   Don't care."
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.520]   That's that.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.520]   Why hasn't that happened?
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.520]   It's just a video.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:24.800]   Well, I don't think it's happened because you have studios and existing financing things
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.520]   that operate in that sort of thing.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.520]   They're working fine.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.360]   When a studio says, "When a studio says they're going to back a film, they're already backing
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.720]   the film."
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.760]   They effectively are a VC, right?
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.200]   What's a VC who's not used to doing investments in movies adding to that process other than
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.960]   unspecialized knowledge and cash, which is a disaster.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.560]   I think that's why it hasn't happened.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:53.760]   I actually think you can find examples of movies where you have had these outside investors
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.120]   put in money just because they're told, "This is a good movie to back."
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.360]   But I think there's also a question about, "Are you backing a movie?
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.920]   Are you backing a performer?
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.640]   Are you backing an entertainment portfolio?"
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.600]   To say, "We each get a VC company to back a movie."
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.160]   Like saying, "We should get a VC company to back the iPhone 6 and they're going to do
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.200]   great off the iPhone 6, but then you're going to have an iPhone 6s out and they don't have
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.480]   anything to do with it."
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.800]   They don't want to back the product.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.880]   They want to back the company that they hope will churn out lots of products.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.680]   Well, they also want return.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:28.000]   I'm just saying it's a different kind of fun.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.560]   Rather than waiting three to five to 10 years for return, you're going to make your blockbuster
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.560]   business of entertainment.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.800]   VC is a blockbuster business with a longer turnaround.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.680]   Entertainment is a blockbuster business with a short turnaround.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.720]   It's going to be all about deal flow.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:50.560]   The first time that somebody goes to a Howard Stern or a David Chase or a Tom Cruise and
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.960]   says, "I'll back your thing to make this independent, screw all the middlemen.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.840]   You are now big enough, the internet is possible enough to go without middlemen.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.080]   We're going to both keep more money as a result."
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.600]   I mean, I don't know why that hasn't happened.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.080]   Why hasn't that happened?
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   You see it much more going the other way.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:14.240]   You see people, Hichary picking YouTube stars, Fred Figgles, whatever his name is.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.960]   People like that, that annoying orange.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.840]   Those people get plucked from because we're in a transition stage.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.040]   It's going to flip.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.760]   This is why I keep, you know, it's the point I know.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:27.520]   Would that be a smart thing for a VC to do to create a content VC right now?
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.520]   No.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.920]   Should Kevin Rose go back to Google Ventures and say, "Let me..."
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.440]   Isn't that what something like an awesomeness is?
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   These are these companies that...
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   That's right.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.440]   So they're...
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   I think they're there.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:41.640]   You're just not recognizing them because VCs are typically identified with funding tech
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   companies.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   Right.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   Right.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   So there are people out there.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.200]   Yeah, it's all those stupid names that appear at the beginning of a movie that are made up
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.200]   companies for the purposes of that.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.640]   Who's the guy who married Pia Zadora?
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.040]   He made all his money.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.920]   Yeah, I know, selling hot tubs.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.680]   I don't remember what it was.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.000]   And then he said, "I want to be a movie producer."
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   And he...
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   What was his name?
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   Okay, Google.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   And Mary Pia Zadora.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Yes.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Rickless.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   Michelle him Rickless.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.320]   He was an Israeli billionaire.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.520]   And he decided he wanted to get in the movie business.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.280]   So he started producing movies.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.000]   This is not an unprecedented, I guess.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   No, but then you had...
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   But then he still had to...
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.320]   That was a distribution issue.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.480]   So he had to go to the movie companies at that point.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   Exactly.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   Exactly.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.280]   For TV and movies and music, you had to have distribution companies.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.800]   In fact, this probably does happen all the time.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.040]   You make the movie, then you go to Sundance.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   And you say, "Okay, who wants to distribute this?"
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.040]   Right, but that's the...
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.600]   That's the argument we were making.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.720]   What you were asking was, "Where do you get the risk capital to make it in the first
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   place?"
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.720]   Right.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.720]   Well, there are people doing everything.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.720]   There you're saying that.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.720]   Anyway, good subject.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   Love it.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.880]   But there's phones to talk about.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.800]   And gadgets and gizmos.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.360]   And buttons.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   Buttons.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.840]   Important things to talk about.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   Not really.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   I stopped you from making your sponsor break, didn't I?
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   No, I did it.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   I just did it so subtly.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   I slid it in, you didn't even notice.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   That's right.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   That's right.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.840]   This is like medicine into a baby's mouth.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   All of a sudden...
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.840]   Here comes the commercials.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:21.040]   You open wide.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.040]   That's...
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.760]   We had a great pediatrician.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   That's exactly what he would do.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.320]   He was going to give the kid a shot.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.320]   He'd shake him.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.320]   And then he'd go, "What?"
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.320]   And then he'd go, "Boom."
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.720]   They wouldn't even know.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.720]   What happened?
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.960]   It's a little weird, but it worked.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   When are you getting your...
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   Moto.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   My Google what?
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:40.960]   Moto left.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   My hub.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:42.960]   My hub.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.120]   I canceled this actually good subject.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   I canceled it.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.960]   Because of the Asus.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.560]   Well because of the R's Technica review, Ronam audio reviewed it and said this thing is
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.400]   a pig.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.760]   It is not a good router.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:03.280]   He calls it their Smart Home Trojan Horse and a $200 leap of faith.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:08.280]   And if you look at the benchmarks he did with a two-year-old Asus router was very, very
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   slow.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:13.680]   He also says it's very limited because the only way to configure it is with the app.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.800]   And the app has very few features.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.920]   It is not, in fact, I thought, "Oh, this is from Google.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.600]   This is going to be a sophisticated device."
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.000]   And in fact, it's not.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.200]   Look at the transfer times.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.080]   This is not even the latest Asus router.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.120]   It's a couple of year old Asus router.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   It took for a four-gig file over Wi-Fi 312 seconds, five minutes on the Google Hub, one
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.040]   minute on the Asus.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.280]   But that Asus is the old and busted, the new hotness they announced today.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.280]   The Spyder router.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.400]   It's a 2.167 gigabits per second on two 5 gigahertz bands.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.400]   It's blistering.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400]   Fastest router ever.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.560]   I actually bought yesterday.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.840]   So I canceled the on-hub and I bought the high-end Asus router of yesterday.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.840]   Shutter-weighted.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.840]   Shutter-weighted.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.960]   It's coming today, unfortunately.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.720]   But it still will be much faster than this.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720]   Yes.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   You're getting your on-hub tomorrow?
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720]   Walmart lied.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.840]   They kept on saying it was delivered August 21st.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840]   I finally ended up dating.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840]   It was awful.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.720]   All I got from Walmart was spam.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.720]   So I canceled that.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.880]   And then somebody on Twitter said, "I just got it on Best Buy.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.200]   Of course, Pavlov's dog that I am.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.600]   I immediately ordered a Best Buy."
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   Oh, I did too.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.760]   I ordered as fast as I could.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.160]   It's coming tomorrow.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.080]   I'm glad mine's not coming because I cancel it.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.160]   But I will be very interested in your results.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.680]   Well, if or now, maybe I won't open the box.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.680]   I don't know.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.800]   The problem I have is, you know, I test a lot of stuff.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   Internet in the House is a mission critical thing.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.160]   I screw with the Internet in the House at my own peril.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.720]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.320]   It's not something I want to benchmark.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.840]   And this really was a pig in a poke.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.520]   And after reading Rana Manio's review, I was a little hurt because a lot of people got
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.040]   free on-hubs because they were invited to a Google event which we were not invited to.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.400]   But now I'm glad because they got to review it and let us know not to buy it.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.400]   Were all the reviews?
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   I thought.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400]   They were all very negative.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.400]   But Ron's was...
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400]   Look, we know Ron.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   He was on the show.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400]   We know Ron.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.400]   We trust Ron.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.400]   And I tell you what, you look at these benchmarks.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.680]   Now, admittedly, these are...
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.840]   You know, this is...
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.520]   It's hard to benchmark this kind of thing.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   But I think it's much...
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.520]   It's very...
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.040]   What it became immediately clear is this is not a state of the art router.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.880]   This is really all about home automation.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.360]   Yes.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.080]   And I'm not really ready to pick a winner in home automation.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.800]   We're going to see an Apple TV next week that will do this similar thing.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.160]   I've got smart things.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160]   I think that there's...
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.520]   And the new smart things is coming.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.520]   I think...
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520]   I feel like there...
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.080]   Look at the difference in speed.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.400]   This thing was about one-fifth to one-sixth the speed of a couple of year old ASUS Wifi
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   router.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400]   Yep.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.320]   That is not impressive.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.120]   I mean, they've got some intelligent switching around of...
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.800]   You know, there's some intelligence behind it.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.920]   It's just I would like to see that applied to a really fast router.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.200]   Well, I think there's intelligence.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.240]   Because remember we had Matt cuts on and he initially said, "Well, it's got 13 antennas
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.400]   and it changes...
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.640]   It will change the band every 15 minutes."
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.160]   It's got 13 antennas.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.800]   Am I racing plate has five blades?
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   I know.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:39.520]   Well, and then Matt kind of interestingly said, "Oh, I've just heard from the on-hub team.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.240]   It does have 13 antennas.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.800]   It does check the state of the Wifi over 15 minutes, but it doesn't switch."
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.240]   So it's like, "Well, what are you doing there?
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.240]   What's going on there?
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.920]   What is it checking for?
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   What's it checking for?"
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.160]   Yep, they're still there.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.120]   No, I am not a privacy nut, by the way.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.120]   I don't care that it's Google's hub in my house.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.760]   Oh, and I trust them to do it right.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.880]   I don't think that's a problem.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   I just...
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.520]   I like my Apple time caps or whatever I have in my air.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.920]   You know, I've been having so much trouble with my airport extreme and I have the new
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.320]   one that I really am ready to try a different router.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.440]   ASUS does make very, very, very good routers.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.480]   One thing ASUS does is when I got...
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.960]   Okay, it's not a spider, but it does have five antennas.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.880]   It's tri-band because it's got dual five gigahertz plus...
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.360]   And five gigahertz has been very, very good dust.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.960]   I don't know.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   I'm desperate.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960]   I got the 3,200.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960]   That's what I got.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.200]   There's also multiple LAN ports.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.720]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.800]   I just feel like there's more.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   More I could do.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.960]   I decided not to sacrifice myself, but good on you, Jeff, and let us know how you like
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.960]   it.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.960]   I don't know.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.960]   I'm...
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   No, I'm...
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960]   Jake, depends on what Jake says.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.120]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.120]   Everybody needs a Jake.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.120]   What do you think, Jake?
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   Give me a yell on me.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120]   Give...
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.120]   Let's have Jake give us a benchmark.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:03.400]   You know, we should still get one at a benchmark.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.720]   I've got a Jake too, and I don't think it is a good thing to have a Jake because you
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.600]   do rely, you're like, "Okay, nerdy child of mine who I gave life to.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.000]   Fix all this stuff for me.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   Please."
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.200]   I don't have to learn how to do it.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.240]   Yeah, I do.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:23.600]   So Motorola today at noon launched the new Moto X a day early.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   They tweeted it.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.280]   They had a tweet that said September 3.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.920]   I was expecting September 3.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.960]   And then they tweeted a date yesterday.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.880]   We're going to do it tomorrow.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.560]   So the Moto Maker is there.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.360]   I don't know much about it.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:41.360]   The choices are three different layer levels of storage.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.960]   16.32 for another 50 bucks.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.240]   64 gigs for 100 bucks extra.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.520]   Moto Maker is there with all the traditional Moto Maker choices including different front
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:58.720]   colors, different back styles, leather, wood, and plastic, different accents, and graving,
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.640]   and so forth.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:05.720]   This is the new Moto X Pure which is a 5.7, right?
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.560]   It's a pretty big phone.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.120]   Everybody's doing big phones now.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.840]   They also unexpectedly announced a new Moto 360.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.080]   Actually several new Moto 360 watches.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.960]   Android Wear really seems to be going somewhere.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.960]   I'm very interested.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:24.800]   And by the way, why couldn't they get rid of the flat tire?
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.880]   There's always a flat tire.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.280]   But they could have found a clever way to hide it.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.160]   Yeah, with a big bezel around it.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.440]   Well, something.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.680]   But that's how the other guys do it.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:35.680]   Yeah, I know.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.040]   And the problem is that you have less screen as a result because a bit...
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.080]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.360]   The site is really suffering.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:45.600]   I think a lot of people are ordering products.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.560]   I think that it's just a day-side to have a larger screen, less bezel.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.640]   This is an interesting one.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:56.000]   This is the first Android Wear watch with a built-in GPS, a runners watch.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   Yep.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   Then I think we'll do well.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.280]   That would be nice.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   That's not available immediately.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.520]   And this will work with Apple.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.600]   Well, that's the other stories that they have now put out an Android Wear app on Apple
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:09.600]   for the iPhone.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.080]   I haven't played with it yet.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.280]   Meghan Moroni, who does iOS Today with us, has my...
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.680]   I just gave her my LG Urbain because that's the only one that's...
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.680]   It was a ruse.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.600]   She just wanted to get her hands on your watch.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   So she's going to try it.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   Well, I don't have my iPhone anymore.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.040]   I gave it to my son in preparation for the new iPhone.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.520]   So I can't tell you.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:32.040]   But I can't imagine it does quite as much as the Android phone because iPhone is still
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040]   locked down.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.920]   But the fact is that people don't do much with their Apple watches or Android Wear watches
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   anyway.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   They don't have much with any wear.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.800]   They mostly notifications, which works fine.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   And a few other things.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.320]   So I think it's actually for people who want to have an iPhone but also don't want to
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.640]   spend a fortune on a watch and want a good watch that costs less than an Apple watch,
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.880]   it's a good option.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.520]   I think that's why this is interesting because Apple doesn't currently do a GPS.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.600]   If you want GPS functionality, you have to take your phone with you.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.400]   This new Moto 360 Sport does have GPS.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.040]   I mean, there are high-end runners watches that do this.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.840]   But if you're a runner, this is really cool.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.720]   And then the other new 360 has a variety of looks.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.960]   I'm trying to get into the sight because it's been really...
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   I feel so lost.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.480]   I don't know which of the new Android watches or the watches that you should have.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   I'm stuck with it.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.480]   There's some really good looking ones though.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.080]   I thought it was all about the 360, but everybody talks about the surveying or whatever.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.920]   No, don't get the urbane.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.680]   That's now last generation.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.520]   But there's other round ones that look good.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.160]   It wasn't Sony's.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   It wasn't Samsung.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   They're doing Tizen.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160]   Huawei has Huawei.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160]   Huawei just came out and said...
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.200]   I keep hearing really great things in this Huawei watch.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.200]   Nice look at Android.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   We're round Android.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.760]   We're watch with no flat tire, I think.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   See?
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   See?
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.320]   But it'll have a bigger bezel as a result.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.920]   Gold.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.880]   And you can get gold with a micro-neural.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   See, that's not...
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880]   That bezel's not...
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.360]   I'll take that bezel.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.880]   No, this is the Moto 360.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880]   You will take.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.120]   Yeah, this isn't...
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120]   You want all gold?
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.600]   Where's the Huawei?
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600]   You can do all gold.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.600]   Should we look at Huawei?
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   All right.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:19.160]   H-W-U-W-E-I, Android Wear watch.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.000]   Here it is.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.720]   Some people have hands-on already.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.720]   It's up for pre-order.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.640]   Pre-order is just started.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.720]   I'm sorry, I'm still stalled back at the $350 thing for something that's not being pushed
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.960]   by Apple, which I think the Apple watches are already overpriced.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.800]   But it's Apple.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   So what...
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   I know.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.200]   Well, Apple's done so well then.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.200]   Or apparently done so well that Huawei said...
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.200]   It's Apple.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   But Huawei's...
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   But Huawei's...
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   But Huawei's...
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.760]   These two are the urbane, which we were talking about.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.240]   The middle one is the Huawei.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.440]   And you see a small bezel and no flat tire.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.560]   So maybe Jeff, your dreams will come true.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   And this...
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.640]   I love how all the images of these don't show any of the actual smart watch functionality.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.640]   Right.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   It's always a watch.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.640]   It's like, look, it's just a watch.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   Right.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   It's not a smart expense.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   It starts at $350.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.280]   It goes all the way up to $800 if you want rose gold with gold links.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.560]   I would not invest a lot in a technology device.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.560]   It's got a good...
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.920]   I think it's got to get updated.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:29.720]   I think these watches are very strongly targeted at Chinese buyers who are looking for status
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   symbols.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.720]   You have a reach.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   Right.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.000]   So and Huawei has a much better reputation in China than it does outside of China.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   So...
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.120]   Sapphire Glass display, which Apple couldn't...
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120]   Yep.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.520]   Actually, no, Apple has it on their higher end watches.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.360]   Not this sport.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360]   Right.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.840]   With the charger looks very much like the Apple charger.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.200]   I think this is probably intentional.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   Right.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.560]   With Chinese currency heading down fast, you wonder if they're going to use that as not
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.560]   a market.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560]   Maybe that's not a market.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.320]   Four stat tag and 400.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.760]   That's what everybody's using these days.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.920]   I'm not sure I'll order this.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.040]   Do you want to get this one?
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040]   What?
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040]   I actually...
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040]   It's your turn to buy, Jason.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.000]   Well, I should be getting a review unit from Huawei.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   Oh, nice.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   They reached out to me.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.720]   Oh, I will like this.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.120]   And I said, also, anything else Huawei.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120]   Let's send it my way.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.400]   The Mate 4 looks very nice.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.200]   Anything else Huawei while we're talking about Huawei?
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   What else Huawei?
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200]   When it looks like...
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.040]   Like maybe possibly, I don't know, your Nexus that's going to be announced at the end
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.040]   of the month?
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.560]   Oh, that's another story.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.720]   The rumor is September 29th at Google Nexus event.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:42.880]   LG Nexus 5, Huawei Nexus 6.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   It's phone season.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   It's device season.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.720]   It's crazy.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.520]   This is the Huawei you want to get the Mate S.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.560]   I would have checked that out.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.480]   And that is gold, yes, but not solid gold.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   Just, you know, and that's the one.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.120]   As long as the back doesn't curve and I can put a wallet case around it, you can talk
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   to me.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120]   Oh, it does.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.120]   It looks like an HTC One.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.560]   Then don't talk to me.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.800]   It'll catch up a credit card in that, Google.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   Thanks very much.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.800]   But I can in that.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   Now you're talking.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   Well, you don't think Danny, Danny, you're right.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.480]   The other problem I have is whenever I'm at a restaurant, you can talk to me.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480]   I'm sitting alone.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.200]   My sad life, you know, I have lunch.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.880]   The damn bat rabbit keeps on pulling around.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.640]   I have to get a napkin to put the phone alone.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   You can spin the iPhone.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   Spin the iPhone.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   Spin the phone.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   But I'm serious.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.920]   Like I have not carried a wallet now for like two years.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.560]   Like I've managed to get by if I just carrying two credit cards, my driver's license at an
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.920]   extra $20 bill tucked into my phone.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.920]   And it's been revolutionary.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:51.440]   I mean, it's so liberating having only one thing that I'm carrying around.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.920]   That to me is like a standard.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.440]   I can't say I can't buy your curved phone.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:07.800]   I just bought a wallet case from a dodo case from the new iPhone that has a wallet built
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.800]   into it.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.320]   Oh, and the flip thing on the front, I don't want that.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.320]   You don't want that either though.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.720]   You just want it on the back.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.320]   Don't have time to be trying to flip my case around.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.320]   Don't have time.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.240]   Don't nobody got time for that.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.200]   Nobody nobody got time for that.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.440]   Don't you know, Danny is a busy guy.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.440]   I'm a busy guy.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.200]   Nobody got time for flipping this.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.600]   I love flipping casing.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.640]   Flipping the case and flipping flipping.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   No flipping.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.800]   Well, and Danny, you're always biking and kayaking and going to the beach and doing stuff like
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.800]   that.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.040]   So it's like, you know, not having a wallet.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.720]   It's like you only have one thing and you're not going to forget your phone.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.720]   So one one.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.720]   And you're not going to.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.360]   You're not going to forget your phone.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.320]   This is also the cashier so many.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.360]   So this is the Zen watch too for me.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.800]   Sue's coming in October.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.440]   Some of this is because of IFA.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.440]   Most of it is because of the holiday shopping season.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.440]   It's around the corner.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.800]   I don't know why I would have to go make a big comparison chart for all this stuff.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.000]   So much crap.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.080]   Just to figure out what one I should actually care.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.520]   We said there were too many TV shows.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.680]   No, that's not the problem.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.240]   There's too many watches, phones, tablets.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:11.600]   We're being buried in crap.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.040]   I can't wait till I buy one thing and stick with it for more than a month.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.400]   Good luck with that.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.560]   You don't really know.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.720]   I do, but Lisa won't let me.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.320]   I actually said at the beginning of this silly season that we're just entering, I actually
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.960]   said I'm not going to buy any of these new phones.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.200]   And Lisa says the hell you're not.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:37.120]   I even bought well, I told you about the Robin's egg.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.240]   I did not get the new Nest thermostat.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.680]   I bought, you know, I had a nest and I never installed it in the new house.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.680]   Do you have a nest?
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.680]   No, I don't.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.680]   Big screen.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.840]   I've got a box one sitting out there too.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.840]   I haven't installed it.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.040]   I installed one just to understand how they worked, even though I never really needed it
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.960]   for like five days a year.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.600]   Although it was pretty handy when it would actually get cold enough that we needed to
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.680]   turn on the heat and I could do it from the couch.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.680]   I was like, yeah, that's nice.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.680]   I was like a hero.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.680]   Oh, you want heat?
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.680]   Here we go.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.920]   Now you could, if you have an Amazon Echo, you could say turn up the heat with your Echo.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.640]   I'm not allowed to use the Echo.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640]   What?
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.560]   My wife is tired of us all yelling at it.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.520]   We get these competitions.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.240]   It's like, Echo, play this Echo volume five.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.240]   Echo volume ten.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.240]   Echo, what's that?
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.240]   Echo, what's that?
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.280]   Oh boy, we are setting everybody's Echo off right now.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.800]   No, no, he's good.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800]   He's saying Echo.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.800]   No, he's the other word.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   Right, right.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   That's the right way to do it.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.800]   Thank you very much, Danny.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.800]   Good.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   Good.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   Good.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800]   Good job.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.800]   I actually bought a second one, Danny.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   It's all downstairs.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.440]   The box of volume ten.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.680]   I have his and her.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.880]   I have his and her echoes now.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   That's how we solve that.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.920]   I don't have it here, but I got one of the NESCAM to see how that worked too.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.800]   I put it in the kitchen and nobody knew.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.680]   Oh, that got me in trouble once.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.280]   We were watching him make stuff.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.960]   I was showing my wife.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.640]   We were going, are you sure you want that?
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   And he's just like, he's got the camera all of a sudden you see him go.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.520]   Oh, there's a camera in here.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:13.720]   It's classic.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.000]   Also, today at IFA, Acer had its press conference is announced.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.640]   A new phone, the Predator 6.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:25.040]   This is not a joke.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.440]   Ten core, ten core smartphone.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.200]   It's a deca core media tech processor.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200]   It's a console that also has a phone at it.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.200]   Yeah, basically.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.440]   One of the four gig's of RAM, six inch display, four speakers, haptic feedback.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.080]   What OS is it running?
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.080]   I'm sure it's Android.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.320]   I mean, so what am I playing on it that I need all that?
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.600]   There's good Android games.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.960]   You sound like an iPhone owner.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.720]   I know there are, but what Android game is demanding?
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:54.720]   Ten core processing.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.720]   I have five Japanese.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.720]   I have five Japanese.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.720]   I have five Japanese.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720]   Lovely game.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.160]   This is future proofing, so you never ever have to buy another phone again.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.920]   A fall out shelter.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.400]   I did that last time.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.960]   That's why I'm not buying this phone.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.720]   Now, actually, fall out shelter I could use a better processor.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.440]   Because I think it's a big thing.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.440]   OK, see?
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.440]   See?
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.440]   That's the Apple.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.440]   The theme.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.240]   No, a fall out shelter is on Android.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.040]   Oh, yeah, it is, isn't it?
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040]   Yeah, everything's on Android.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.600]   Yeah, it is on Android, but you can't move what you did on whatever device you're on.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.480]   That's the device you're on for the run to your life and fall out.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.440]   I don't care because I only have like 20.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440]   Don't spend any energy.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.120]   But this is the theme so far at IFA.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.000]   We saw it in the Sony event.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.240]   We see it here.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.240]   These companies are coming out.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.760]   These really amazing phones with amazing specs.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.600]   The Sony phone has a 4K display and 23 megapixel camera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   These companies, it's so hard to compete in this business that they're all coming out
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.600]   and targeting these tiny markets.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.920]   How many people are going to buy a 10-core smartphone?
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.920]   300 people?
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.360]   I mean, it's a tiny, tiny market.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.880]   In Sony and Acer, they're going after these really minuscule markets because the big
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.040]   markets are being completely taken over by the Chinese companies, by Apple, Samsung
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.040]   and others.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.000]   But what's falling in my mind is that the cost of the phones, I wish someone would chart
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.080]   it, but they seem to keep going up, right?
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:21.120]   Like an Apple phone, you're getting close to dropping $1,000 on it.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.240]   The edges and everything that came out, and I was thinking, Samsung, you're trying to
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:30.880]   fight with Apple on a device that, aside from the weird edges that don't have much usefulness
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.640]   to them, is oftentimes still seeing this not quite as good yet you still want this premium
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.640]   price.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:42.360]   I guess maybe that's working for them, I guess, but I just look at it and I think, wow, now
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.840]   you're dropping $800 and $900.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.320]   And meanwhile, you've got your PCs that have come down in price.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.520]   It's just like, when did this tiny thing turn out to be much more expensive than that giant
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.520]   thing?
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.520]   Nothing makes sense anymore.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.880]   I think what they're doing is they're chasing margins.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.280]   They're figuring, well, we're not going to go after the mass, we're not going to make
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.520]   it up on volume.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.440]   We need to find a niche that can have some margins where it can have profitability.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.560]   And it's very difficult to do because, as we know, there are only two companies in the
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.200]   industry making profits.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:15.320]   And so I think that's what this rising price is phenomenon is all about, Danny.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.760]   It's all about like, well, if we have a really high-end, really expensive phone, we charge
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.040]   $800 for it, maybe we can make it for $750, we'll make $50 a phone.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.520]   Or the race to the bottom.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.920]   You go one and two, right?
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   You don't want to be in the middle.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.920]   Although, Moto's in the middle, that's $400, $500.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.160]   Well, that's the other thing is I look at something like the Moto X.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:37.720]   Somebody was asking me for like, they wanted a phone and I was like, the Moto X, I mean,
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:41.880]   it's like $400 for an unlocked, awesome phone.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.400]   It's cheaper than the Nexus 6.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:50.400]   And in fact, the Moto X that they had really was the Nexus 6 for all purposes, right?
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.560]   And it was cheaper than buying it from Google.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.800]   It was better than the Nexus 6, really.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.440]   Yeah, so I look at that.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.680]   I just kind of think, gosh, I hope Motorola makes it because, you know, it's nice to see
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.920]   phones that are being sold at sensible prices.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.280]   But Jason Halzo host of all about Android.
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.280]   He's also our producer.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.240]   Jason, is it just a rumor that new Nexus phones?
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.200]   I mean, do we know anything about them?
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.840]   We'd, well, I mean, we know what we think we know is that LG is going to have a sequel
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:25.080]   to the Nexus 5, the Nexus 5, the original Nexus 5, too, right?
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:29.680]   Right, probably, I mean, in my opinion, probably the best of the Nexus line devices.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.680]   Yep.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.040]   So that's something to look forward to.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:37.760]   And then, of course, Huawei is making the sequel-ish to the Nexus 6 and I think it's
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.280]   going to be a 5.7 inch screen as opposed to 6 inch.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.840]   Just a little too big.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.400]   Yeah, I think, I think most of all.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:52.680]   And then the Huawei device is going to be probably the higher priced device, although
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:58.920]   probably not as extreme as the Nexus 6 was, the Nexus 5 will be a little bit, you know,
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.480]   probably more in that like 400-ish range, I'm guessing.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:07.560]   And then, so CNET says it's going to be September 29th in San Francisco, if it is, by the way,
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.800]   guess who's going?
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:13.600]   What day of the week is that?
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.800]   I don't know, what day of the week is that, you know?
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.800]   If only you bet there's no way to-
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   It's a Tuesday.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.560]   It's a Tuesday, all right.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.560]   Oh, good.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.000]   We can talk about it the next day and you can talk about it that night.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.720]   And these would be, if they come out September 29th, would that mean Marshmallow comes out
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720]   September 29th?
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   Or is this an announcement for a phone that will come out in October and November or December
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.720]   with Marshmallow?
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.280]   The latter, I would think, right?
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.280]   You never know.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   Yeah, I would say the latter.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.720]   I suppose you never know.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720]   You never know.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.760]   I think that's kind of how they've been doing it.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.000]   Which actually, now that I think about it, it is kind of strange that they're planning
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   an event because the last couple of years they really haven't done that.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   I know.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   They've just gone the-
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   You just have to make-
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.840]   We'll put out a press release on the blog and its importance will rise to the top all
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.840]   on its own.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.360]   And I don't know if that's the best strategy, but that's what they've been doing.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.440]   So this would be a little different.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.400]   I feel sorry for Sony because I feel like the experience-
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.560]   And I know, and I've been guilty of this, just doesn't get the attention.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.160]   The last experience I reviewed, the Z3, was a little disappointing.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:20.960]   It had a lot of great specs, especially for the camera, but was not a great camera.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.360]   So I just didn't- I wrote off the Xperia line.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.000]   The new Z5 looks interesting.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.960]   They've got a premium version which won't be available till later this year that is
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.440]   a 4K smartphone.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:38.160]   The chatroom's saying something like 806.per inch, which is 300 more than the Note 5, which
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.160]   is crazy.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.160]   It's 2160x3840.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160]   Wow.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.160]   That's just nuts.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:50.720]   But they say they will upscale high-dough content to look good on a 4K.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.000]   Anything is going to look good on that screen probably.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.800]   There's not a lot of 4K content.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.800]   To me at this point-
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.960]   It'll be good for cardboard.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.320]   So you pointed that out for VR, it's great because you divide it in half.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.920]   So it'll be HDVR capability.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:07.440]   But Sony does have a visor headset.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.960]   You not only divide it in half, but you have a lens that's focusing on something that's
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   two inches from your eyeballs.
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:12.960]   So you're really-
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:13.960]   I would see that.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.960]   What they're looking at the pixels.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:21.240]   Certainly on the Galaxy Gear VR with an S6, I see a screen door effect.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.960]   And it's waterproof so you could have underwater VR.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:24.960]   Nice.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.960]   Finally.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   Finally.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960]   Long lines.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   Long lines.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:29.960]   Oh man.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:34.800]   Sony is losing according to a gadget $1 million a day on mobile.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.800]   It's good business.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   So you got it.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.840]   You really got a wonder.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.640]   In fact, they've been losing money on TV.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.080]   They've been losing money on everything except their insurance business in Japan, which is
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.600]   apparently the only part of Sony that's doing very well.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.080]   I feel for them because they know cameras.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.800]   Boy, I love their cameras.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.760]   Well, here's a theory for you.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:59.120]   What if these phones with these ridiculous specs, 4K, it's got a 23 megapixel camera?
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:04.160]   What if this is just a sales pitch for their components to sell to Apple and Samsung and
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.160]   the companies?
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.160]   This is a reference platform.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.160]   Exactly.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.440]   At this point, battery and camera are all I really care about.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.440]   You know what?
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.440]   Their opportunity was they should have brought back the Walkman cassette.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.440]   They actually did.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440]   Everybody's selling the Walkman.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:21.040]   They need to bring back the Sony I-BO.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.040]   That was what they said.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.040]   Yeah, but that's it.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.440]   You bring it back with the cassette.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.940]   You start getting people talking about how, oh my God, you haven't heard sound quality
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.040]   until you've heard it on tape.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.240]   It's the new vinyl, yeah.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.600]   You bundle it in an MP3 player so it can be dual use and it's going on with it from there.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600]   Can you imagine?
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.600]   The hip's just going to be, yeah, that's right.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.600]   I got my thing.
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.800]   You know, they'd be all walking wearing them.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.360]   They missed it with guardians and guardians too is going to come out and they're going
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.320]   to be cassettes going to be back and they need to be ready for it.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:56.160]   I'm telling you, vintage cassette is coming back and I have got 45 of them ready to go.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.320]   It's true, guardians of the galaxy.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   People are desperate.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   That's the mix tapes.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.480]   People are desperate for my copies of Genesis.
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:06.120]   It's going to be going great.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.120]   I'm ready for it.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.120]   Bring it back.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:12.600]   What if you made like a digital mix tape like it looked like a cassette?
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.600]   I think they did make those.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.600]   I think that's one of their radios.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.240]   You should be talking about mini-disc.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:21.640]   No, it looked like except but it has SSD storage.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.840]   There's audio books basically that are like that.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.320]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.560]   Our show today brought to you speaking of audio books by FreshBooks.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.560]   Not about audio books.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:37.440]   It's FreshBooks is a cloud accounting system that makes it so much easier for you to do
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:44.960]   what you have to do which is send out invoices and more time to do what you love to do which
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:50.280]   is do your work, your stuff, the thing, the reason you became a freelancer.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.960]   I love FreshBooks.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.120]   It saved my life.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.120]   It's now almost 10 years ago when I discovered FreshBooks.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.280]   I was doing it by hand as I'm sure many of you still are.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.000]   Now you can use FreshBooks to design a beautiful professional looking invoice.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.440]   Send them out.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.280]   The invoice itself goes in email.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.320]   For a little extra you can actually have them, believe it or not, print it out.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.240]   Look the envelope stamp it.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.240]   Some people still demand that.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.280]   At least they did 10 years ago.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.520]   The nice thing is the email they send out.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:24.600]   Most people prefer and there's a pay me button on it that lets your client pay you instantly.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.760]   And for that reason FreshBooks users get paid about five days faster than people sitting
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.840]   out paper invoices.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.440]   It really is a great system.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.120]   Should you have a slow pay, FreshBooks helps with that too.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.560]   Automatic reminders.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.760]   Great for expenses too.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.200]   If you keep track of those, the FreshBook app on your Android or iOS device will let
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.520]   you take pictures or receipts, get them right into the invoices.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.760]   You can also track your time and hours if you build that way.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.400]   It couldn't be easier.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.280]   I'm telling you, if you're suffering now at the end of every month, sending out those
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.800]   bills, please do yourself a favor.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.040]   For the next 30 days, just try FreshBooks.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.280]   I used to hate that.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:05.240]   I used to dress the worst billing.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.240]   Me too.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.240]   Now it's trivial.
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.040]   It's like a couple of minutes in and out.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.040]   Do you still do?
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.600]   I still use it every single month.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.600]   Because you break articles.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.440]   That's all freelance, right?
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440]   That's all freelance.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.520]   I build with FreshBooks every single time and it's so easy.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.240]   I just go in there and I've already plugged in how much I get per column with the addresses
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.720]   who goes to all that stuff.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.720]   It already knows that stuff.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.080]   I just go in there and say, "Well, okay, there's four of them this week."
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.320]   Click a button, off it goes and they love it because it's always perfectly formatted.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.400]   There are no errors in it.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.280]   There are no problems with it.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.600]   They know what to expect.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.600]   It's fantastic.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.480]   They have great support too from their offices in Toronto.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.320]   They do currencies, all the different currencies.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.680]   That was helpful for me because I was billing Canadian as well as US companies.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.480]   Everything you could think of is in there.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   I want you to go to, and if it's not, you call them.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   They'll put it in there.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.800]   FreshBooks.com/twig, start your 30-day free trial today.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.800]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:03.120]   Like an I, a stand behind it.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.960]   We've both used it.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.160]   New Android tablets.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.800]   Samsung's announced a pretty nice look.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.360]   We ordered that one for review.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.000]   I can't keep up with this.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   You talk about the S2?
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   I don't know.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   That's a good question.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   I have.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.720]   One of those, Lenovo has introduced a trio of Android tablets that are at least a little
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:28.720]   different looking, although it's the Yoga Tab series.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   3.8-inch.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.640]   Yoga Tab 3 is 8 inches.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.200]   Yoga Tab 3 is 10 inches.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:37.080]   The Yoga Tab 3 Pro is 10 inches.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.440]   They have low end and then somewhat higher end.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.080]   Adam-based, the Pro.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.160]   And what's the right side?
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.400]   We're about to enter into the era of giant tablets.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.040]   We've got a projector in it.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.760]   We learned on 9-5 Mac today that the iPad Pro, the long-threatened iPad Pro is actually
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.760]   going to be announced next week, week from today.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.760]   Is it?
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.760]   It is.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:01.760]   Now they're saying it will.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   According to Mark Gurman.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760]   Mark Gurman.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760]   Mark's right.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:05.760]   Pachowski said it.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.760]   And then everybody's saying no, no, Pachowski got it wrong.
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.760]   It's not till October.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.760]   Now, Gurman says it will.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.760]   Good.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.760]   Good.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.760]   And meanwhile, you know, there's...
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.760]   But does it have a Pico projector in the little...
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.160]   In the leg?
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.160]   No.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.360]   No, it does not.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:23.080]   What does that one get accost?
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.080]   599.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.080]   So who has...
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.080]   Who announced the...
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.080]   Who announced the...
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.120]   These are your Lenovo Yoga's.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:40.400]   The Yoga Tab 3 Pro 10 inches has four front-facing speakers, at most 3D surrounds them processing.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.400]   And a Pico projector that could project an image up to 70 inches in size with a brightness
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.400]   of 50 nits.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.120]   I'm going to be honest, getting it just for the Pico projector.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.480]   I think this could be your multimedia device.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   I have a little small one.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.800]   We always would like to take on trips.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:59.040]   And by the time I get it all set up and I've got the thing hooked up in here and the inputs
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.920]   going with there, if I have the movies already on my Android, yeah, it'd be awesome.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:04.920]   Why 5 models?
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:05.920]   Only 499.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.720]   It's the same price as the low-end.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720]   You know what?
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.520]   That Pico projector is piqued to my interest.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   That's the one thing that might...
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.800]   You might be nit-tricky about the brightness though.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   It is a little low.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   You know, it sounds great.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:20.800]   You've got a dark in the room.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.800]   And if it is bright enough, then the battery will last 10 minutes.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.480]   But still, it's an interesting idea.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.200]   This kind of thing has been on the fringe for a long time and it's great to see it kind
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.000]   of like creeping out into something you might actually buy.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   But yeah, I like it.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   Wow.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   Like it.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.960]   It's a projector with a tablet attached, right?
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.960]   All right.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.880]   That one I might get.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:50.640]   So have we talked about Tahoe, the Samsung tablet that's 18.4 inches coming out?
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.640]   That's weird.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.640]   What?
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.800]   So Samsung 2 is a normal-sized tablet.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:31:01.600]   So Tahoe, code name Tahoe, it's a lollipop tablet with mid-range specs, but it's 18.4 inches
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.120]   across for the display.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.840]   And what is the right size for a tablet that's way too big?
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.800]   I guess that's the wrong way to say it.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   I mean, 18.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.960]   That's pretty, I mean, that's like a placement.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.080]   It's like a, it's like a, if this was a laptop screen, it would be a huge laptop.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.640]   It should be your dinner table.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.640]   Yes.
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.640]   Exactly.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.640]   Well, why look at your full-time table?
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:22.640]   Some people like big laptops.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.640]   You have big phones.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.280]   Well, that's why Apple is hoping this pro would go, but that's only 12.9 inches.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.280]   Much larger.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.280]   Hmm.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.960]   That's going to be so bizarre.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:40.200]   We're going to have a 12.9 inch tablet from Apple that I can touch, but I still can't
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.400]   deal with my MacBook screen that way.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400]   Do you, yeah, they really ought to add touch to the MacBook.
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:54.440]   Do you think tablets are a vital, viable category or is it, is that, is it, I'm starting
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:58.520]   to think it's such an intermediate that, especially now that we have big phones, that
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.880]   most people will either use the phone or the laptop and the tablet where it sits in the
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.880]   middle is just not that useful.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:11.640]   It's hard since I moved my wife to the iPhone 6 Plus, she hasn't used her tablet.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.640]   Right.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:16.560]   My sons haven't used their tablets and they're on larger screen phones.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.680]   I still use the tablet all the time, but.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:27.440]   I mean, I have, see, I think the tablets should be super vital and useful, but they're not
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:31.360]   because people don't change their behavior and companies aren't coming along with the
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.360]   program.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:39.080]   To me, I think one of the ideal tablets would be if Chrome, if the Chrome OS had a real touch
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:45.880]   user interface, so you had a totally Chromebook-like cloud-based device that was a tablet, you mounted
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.720]   in places, put it on the refrigerator, put it in, you know, in certain places and it
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:55.560]   was like a, a sort of a public terminal inside your house, that would be super useful.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.560]   Right.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:03.440]   If we had a real sort of desktop style apps that ran on touch devices with a giant screen,
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:10.240]   I'd love to have, I'd love to be able to use an Android device as my full-time desktop
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:13.080]   computer with powerful apps and all that.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.160]   I think we're really getting there, but again, that's not a behavior that people really want
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.160]   to improve.
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.160]   Here is something interesting.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.760]   Microsoft, this is rumored, the Microsoft Continuum Dock.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:27.880]   This will go, we talked about it on Windows Weekly today, this will go with the newest
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:34.360]   Windows phone, which will be, I think, called the CityTalk, or CityMan.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.520]   There's the CityMan in the talkman.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.920]   It's a 5.7-inch kind of family phone.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.960]   It will have, this looks like a Type-C connector.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.840]   I'm almost willing to bet that's a Type-C connector, which then goes into a dock which
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:49.280]   has three USB ports, HDMI and DisplayPort out.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.840]   You connect that to a screen and a computer.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.760]   Your phone is your computer.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.640]   Is that a crazy product?
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:03.160]   Well, we've had those phones that docked into the laptop and made an exactly good laptop.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.600]   But now, from Microsoft, that's what's different about it, right?
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:14.280]   All of a sudden, this is a Windows 10 product, because Windows Phone is Windows 10.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:17.760]   It's very intriguing to me.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.240]   This is a different Microsoft, I have to say.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.800]   That is a crazy product.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.600]   Three USB ports, HDMI and DisplayPort.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.000]   If you get the new high-end, oh, the quin-senium also uses Miracast, which means you don't even
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.640]   have to have a wired monitor.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:42.120]   You pair a mouse and a keyboard with a thing in the dock.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.120]   You won't even need the dock.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.200]   You just Miracast from the phone.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.920]   The phone is a computer.
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.680]   Too bad it's a Windows Phone.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.000]   But Windows Phone is more Windows 10 now than it was before, so anyway.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.240]   We live in interesting times, do we not?
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.800]   Many, many options out there.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.560]   New apps layout for a mobile.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   I haven't seen this.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560]   Have you seen it, Danny?
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.960]   It's not a online either.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.960]   For where?
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.760]   For the store on mobile.
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:16.880]   But, yeah, I was looking at it a little bit yesterday.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.320]   I don't tend to search for apps when I'm on my mobile browser.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.400]   But, yeah, I'd seen that.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.400]   I think it was in testing as well.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.680]   So, it's interesting.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.880]   I think it ties into that.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.960]   I mean, well, I don't know if you want to go back to that other story about them blocking
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.480]   the app install ads too.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.760]   Let's talk about that, yeah.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:43.160]   So, you know, yesterday they Google announced that if you, I think we've all had this happen
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:48.200]   where you do a search, you click on a link, you end up at some website.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.880]   This happened to me with our local TV stations all the time.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.760]   And before you get the article, you get this annoying thing that pops up saying, download
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.520]   our mobile app, right?
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.960]   So, you're like, okay, I'll dismiss that.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.240]   Hate that so much.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.520]   And so, then you read the article.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.520]   And Google feels that you hate it so much that they've decided that if somebody does that
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:11.440]   on their website and they show you a mobile install app that blocks all the content like
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.080]   that, then they're going to go through it.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.640]   And consider the site to no longer be mobile friendly.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.720]   And as a result, it will no longer rank as well when people are doing mobile searches.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:23.200]   So, you're going to get penalized for doing that sort of, it's a little penalty, right?
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.200]   It's a small penalty.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.240]   It's smaller than it sounds, I think.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:29.440]   But we don't actually know how big it is.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.200]   It's a penalty.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.040]   It's probably, we've already had all sorts of sites face penalties for not being mobile
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:39.720]   friendly and still managed to rank well on mobile search results.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:43.640]   And isn't necessarily a, here's why I don't think it's that big of a penalty.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:48.280]   First of all, lots of advertisers are going to go running and stop doing this.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:53.680]   So for the ones who continue doing it, they're going to have a lot more eyeball than users
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:56.840]   are expected to see.
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:03.640]   Secondly, on mobile, I think I would suggest, you know, I would suspect that a lot fewer
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.560]   people arrive at pages through search, right?
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.920]   So you get a link from Twitter or you get through social media or whatever.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.920]   And those--
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.080]   The Google results don't matter.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.680]   The Google research results, yeah, it'll affect some number, but the payoff, there's
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.480]   clearly a big payoff for these kinds of ads.
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.000]   They take over your screen, they say, download this app.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.600]   Well, I'm even tempted to do it.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:29.000]   You know, once we have official apps and you go to our website and mobile, wouldn't I?
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.600]   I mean, it's kind of in my interest to let you know that we have a mobile app.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.920]   We wouldn't do though a big takeover and that's what they're deprecating, right?
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:36.920]   They don't want to think too.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:37.920]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.680]   As long as you want to have a little banner up at the top of the page, then I think it's
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:41.680]   OK.
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.040]   Otherwise, they'll consider, you know, so it's a penalty.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.840]   It doesn't mean that you're necessarily banished from showing up in mobile search results,
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.160]   but yeah, it's Google wielding their power to say, we don't think this kind of behavior
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:57.760]   is good, so you shouldn't do it.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.320]   Which led to my big rant yesterday where I was like, oh, you don't really think things
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.560]   that are annoyingly causing people to install apps should be happening, then maybe you shouldn't
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:10.440]   do that in your own mobile search results.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.920]   And because I don't know if you've noticed, but when you search on mobile in Google, you
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.080]   get all this stuff trying to get you to install apps now.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.920]   So if you've got my article from MarkiLan, you'll see, but you know, one example is I
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.520]   do this search for say, Denali.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.080]   And in the middle of the page is telling me, hey, download these apps.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.960]   They have content related to that.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.360]   And they're news apps and the content that they have related to it, it's just web content.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:40.080]   I don't need the apps to read that content, but Google's decided to take, you know, like
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:47.120]   10% of their search results page and devote it to telling me to install apps that I don't
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.040]   necessarily need because I could just click from my mobile web browser.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.040]   >> That's so annoying.
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.040]   Look at that.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.040]   See, that's an example there.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.040]   >> That's a takeover.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.640]   That's the whole page is blocked.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.480]   >> Well, in the thing above, you know, like when you.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.480]   >> That's terrible.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.480]   The one above that one, Jason.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:03.480]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.240]   That's the kind of thing that Google's going after because the point is that's annoying.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:12.040]   Why would you want to get that when you click from the mobile search results to get to an
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.040]   article?
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.480]   But then if you scroll down, then see, you can do the search yourself.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:20.320]   I searched for Denali and then Google's like saying, here's more content than apps.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:26.160]   If I were to go download the Mount Mc, the Wikipedia app or the NBC News app, then I
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.920]   can read these articles, right?
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.760]   Except that I don't need to get those app through those articles.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.840]   Those articles exist on the mobile web.
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:36.800]   So why are you shoving app installs at me in the mobile search results because it's
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.040]   annoying and you're not a paid result.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.560]   That's not a paid thing, but it's annoying.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:48.720]   So then and then go down one more or in another case where I searched for say Best Buy, here
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:52.200]   they say, I don't have the YP app installed, right?
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.800]   But here they're giving me a link in my mobile search results to the YP app.
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:57.800]   That's not right.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.160]   But I don't have it installed.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.600]   So now I'm going to have to go install it.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.880]   And it's like, so I'm on a browser.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.880]   Give me results I can see in the browser.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:12.080]   And that was sort of my argument, which is you, Google are one of the major players that's
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:18.160]   giving people so many incentives to create and have apps, some of whom don't even necessarily
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.880]   need to have them.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.520]   So you're kind of eroding the support for the mobile web.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:26.720]   And then you get upset that when people are on the mobile web trying to drive people to
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.880]   the apps that you now decide that you should penalize them for it.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.880]   That's a different division.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.480]   Yeah, it's annoying.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.760]   So anyway, that was sort of my thought to Google, which was, yeah, you want to crack
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.760]   down.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.040]   And the other thing too is, why are you just going after apps?
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.840]   Because any takeover app is annoying.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.000]   So you know, it's difficult all of them.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.040]   Well, and I still don't have an answer from them as to why it is.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:58.000]   Now I could theorize that some people might find the app and stall ads, especially annoying,
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   right?
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000]   Because it's like, well, why should I get this ad for their app to the articles right
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000]   there?
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.960]   But then so what if the publisher wants to show, so if the same publisher showed you
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:14.120]   a takeover ad for one of their events or one of their newsletters, you don't have a
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:18.120]   problem with that.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.120]   Where did the audio go?
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.120]   Is that me?
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.120]   No, it just put it.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.120]   No, I'm hearing you.
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:23.120]   Oh, good.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.120]   Google did it.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.120]   Look over at the router blocked me out.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.120]   Oh, they didn't.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:34.200]   But what I think is like, so if a publisher wants to promote something else of theirs that
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.920]   allows them to connect with readers, like say I have a newsletter and I decide to do
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.720]   a takeover app saying, hey, make sure you follow a newsletter.
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.160]   Say I want you to follow us on Twitter or Facebook and I do takeover things saying,
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.480]   make sure you follow us on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.400]   They don't block that.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.320]   It's only the apps that they've kind of gone after.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.720]   And so we had this opinion piece from Jeremy's Dopplement from Yelp last week.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:58.880]   He was like, hey, we think they're trying to do this stuff because it's all anti-competitive
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.160]   that the more people install apps, the less likely they're going to be.
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:06.480]   Now he's going to have his own take on that and you can certainly poke at it.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:13.160]   But when you go after just app install apps on the rationale that we don't like them because
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.520]   they're annoying to users, all the takeover apps are annoying to users.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:18.920]   That's the same problem.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:26.040]   And if you're going to be cynical about it, Google makes apps.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.400]   Any other app is theoretically a competitor for eyeballs and attention to their own.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.680]   And now, like, as to what Apple's doing in the opposite direction, putting content blockers
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.400]   in Safari encourages you to use apps.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.120]   Where Apple sells ads.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.120]   Exactly.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.120]   Exactly.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.240]   And Danny, on the annoyance meter, how does that rank against the idea of putting native
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.760]   ads in Gmail?
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.760]   What?
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.000]   Yeah, Google is putting native ads in Gmail.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.240]   They've been testing it for two years.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:52.120]   And basically, what are native ads?
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.280]   It means that it appears in your inbox.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.280]   In my email?
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.280]   Yes.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.840]   It appears in your inbox as a mess as a-- it looks kind of like a--
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.320]   They're going to give me spam.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.320]   They're going to give you spam.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.320]   And when you-- you're able to forward it.
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.320]   Wait, where does it appear?
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320]   That's right.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.320]   I thought it still appeared separately.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320]   I couldn't see an example.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.840]   It appears-- as I understand it, I haven't seen it myself, but it basically-- it appears
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:15.120]   as in the same space where your incoming messages are.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.240]   And then you can open it, and it's an ad.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.680]   And then you can save it to your inbox.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.200]   You can forward to somebody else.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.480]   You can do stuff like that.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:26.760]   But the big insult is that it comes right into your inbox.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:29.200]   I wish I could reverse my screen.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.560]   Maybe there's a way for me to do it.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.160]   Hang on here.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.320]   Do you have some in front of you?
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.760]   Then I was just yesterday, by the way.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.760]   Hang on here.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:39.200]   Although they said, according to Frederick Lauden-Waz writing in TechCrunch, they said
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.240]   that we've been doing this since 2013.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.240]   Well, but they've been testing it.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.240]   And you see on my screen.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.120]   So these are the ads that are coming here.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.680]   There's something you're going to see that's getting--
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680]   Oh, I've seen this.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:50.280]   This is in the promotions folder.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:53.640]   But if I click on it, then I get-- see how I've got a whole--
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640]   Ah.
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.280]   --particle that's showing up like that.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.760]   But it's a promotion.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:03.120]   But I've seen ads in the promotions folder provided that did not come into my email.
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.520]   Well, that's just because it is in promotions.
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:08.400]   Potentially, I think you could get your ads in anywhere, even if they were.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.840]   No, that's not good.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.760]   That would be-- that would cause me to be screaming against Google.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.840]   And the value of priority inbox is not to get--
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:17.840]   Not to see that.
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.520]   And then I would argue that-- watch out.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.520]   In the European case, if they cut out everything else in the world of spam but allowed their
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.440]   stuff in, as not spam is paid, not going to look good Google, not going to look good
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.560]   at all.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.840]   Because that is, in fact, you advantaging yourself with the paid.
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:39.920]   If that's what they're doing, I'm not convinced they would do that.
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920]   I don't think they're that.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:47.320]   I think somebody in the organization is going to scream evil from the mountaintops.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.480]   You're a world traveler.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:49.960]   You all world travelers.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:55.000]   Perhaps you have been in a city where you've heard the call to prayer.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.600]   Yes, I've been in that very city.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.600]   That's Istanbul.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:58.600]   That's Istanbul.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600]   At night.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.600]   There's the Red Mosque.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.600]   Is that the Red Mosque?
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.600]   I don't think so.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   I can't tell.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.600]   Maybe not.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600]   I think it is.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.600]   Those are the towers.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:10.000]   Because the Red Mosque has more towers than any other mosque is allowed to have except the
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000]   one in Mecca.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.720]   I think there's five.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:15.880]   And the problem with Istanbul is that they all go off at the same time.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.880]   Well, that's intentional.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.880]   Well, yeah.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:22.640]   But it's like it's a cacophony rather than a lovely moment.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:29.080]   Well, in Egypt, a Muizine, that's the call, the person who sings those calls, is in trouble.
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:35.520]   Because he changed the call during the dawn prayer from praying is better than sleep to
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:38.080]   prayer is better than Facebook.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:44.680]   And that's a dubious proposal.
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:47.440]   I think that's what a cleric's supposed to do.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.240]   Just root canals better than Facebook.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.640]   But he's in serious trouble.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.640]   He is.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.580]   The religious endowment's ministry is investigating him after locals complained last week.
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:03.280]   He went on a hunger strike and then he denied he said it.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:06.440]   I don't know what Facebook is and I don't know how it's spelled.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:09.520]   He says, of course, everybody heard him say it.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.160]   So this denial doesn't really affective.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.760]   They're trying to remove him from the mosque.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.800]   My wife is chatting me and saying it was a blue mosque, not the red mosque.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.800]   Blue mosque.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:21.800]   Thank you.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:22.800]   You're right.
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:23.800]   Of course, Amir, that's the blue mosque.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:24.800]   That's what I meant.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:25.800]   I don't know where the red mosque is.
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.800]   Is there a red mosque?
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:29.240]   They should do the towers in different colors like Google.
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.240]   Beautiful, actually.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.040]   It's a most beautiful mosque.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.080]   Yes, of course, the blue mosque.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.640]   If you could see the roof, you would say, oh, yeah, the blue mosque.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:39.640]   The red mosque is in.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.640]   It's a red square.
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.640]   Right.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:43.640]   All right.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:52.600]   But that's just, you know, that's, let's see what else.
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:56.880]   Face speaking of Facebook, we didn't mention this because it happened after the show last
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.360]   week.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:05.880]   Mark Zuckerberg announced that one billion people used Facebook on August 24th.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:06.880]   Was that after our show?
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.880]   Maybe not.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:09.880]   Did we talk about it?
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:10.880]   I don't think that we talked about it.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:11.880]   I don't think we talked about it.
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:13.720]   That would have been an easy number for me.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:15.720]   All right.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:17.720]   And you were stolen from me.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.720]   They don't want to complain.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.720]   I would have remembered all that.
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:20.720]   I liked the wired take on it.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.400]   Only 85.7% of the earth did not use Facebook on Monday.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.720]   Still a billion mobile users.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:28.720]   Daily mobile users.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.240]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.720]   What's the number when it prompts the necessity for the US government to go in like
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.920]   Venezuela and with machine guns and take over the place and make it a public utility?
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:41.920]   At what, you know, what is it?
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:42.920]   2 billion, 3, 4 billion?
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:47.080]   No, because we do not live in a socialist nation, my friend.
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.840]   The People's Republic of Facebook, apparently.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.840]   I don't know what to say about the number.
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.040]   We trust Facebook's numbers, right?
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.480]   I mean, there's no way to really verify it.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.640]   It's probably, yeah.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.400]   To me, I always think of the engineering miracle that that is.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:11.080]   That you could have a system of servers all containing the same content that a billion
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.760]   people could see on any given day is a mind boggling.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.040]   And I don't hear this a lot, but I've experienced it myself.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.760]   Facebook is very fast as a website.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:21.760]   It's snappy.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760]   It's snappy.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:24.520]   Much more so than any other social network.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:27.960]   It's even faster now that I use that thing, the flat Facebook that you recommend.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.240]   The flat Facebook flat.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.240]   I love that.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.240]   It was at yours.
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:33.240]   It was mine.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:38.920]   It's a Chrome plugin that gives Facebook an updated design.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:39.920]   It's flat.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.760]   It's pretty.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.560]   It's fast.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.560]   Combine that with UBlock Origin.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.600]   You don't see any ads.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.160]   Life is good in Facebook land.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.160]   Yep.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:54.520]   And I feel bad because I know that Mark needs my money, but isn't that pretty?
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.520]   That's a Facebook flat Chrome plugins.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.440]   That was Mike's pick a couple of weeks ago.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.720]   But I often load all the social networks.
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:05.720]   It's so fast.
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.720]   I go in there and I go, "Google+ Twitter, Facebook+."
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:09.720]   Facebook is always the first to load.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.440]   And it's in PHP.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.080]   How is that possible?
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:17.080]   I don't know.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.760]   Everybody hates you when you use your phone at dinner.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:25.600]   Really fortunate and you needed to write an article on this.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.360]   It's in depth research.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360]   Yes.
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.640]   They got to expense a restaurant meal in order to research it too.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:39.240]   Pure research center found that 88% of response believe it's generally not okay to use a cell
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.400]   phone during dinner.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.720]   94% say cell phone use is inappropriate during meetings.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.960]   95% say they shouldn't be used at theaters.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.320]   96% say they shouldn't be used during religious services.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:57.200]   100% say you should never mention Facebook in the call of prayer.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:01.600]   But there are different numbers for what other people should do versus what I should do.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.320]   I'm sorry, that was a lot of...
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.320]   What are you doing?
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.320]   Stop it.
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:07.320]   Pay attention.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:10.560]   We're trying to do this.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:17.200]   77% said it's okay to use a cell phone when walking down the street or on public transit.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.200]   No, it's not.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:19.200]   New York where people just...
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200]   They walk into you.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.200]   They walk into you.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:27.160]   Can I just say again, to any tech company, whatever they want to do it, I have your
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:28.160]   solution.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.920]   All you need is a forward-facing camera right here.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:36.840]   If you could just get us a forward view when we use our phones, then we can have a little
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.600]   window down at the bottom and we can see what's coming at us.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.600]   How hard is it?
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.240]   Can you imagine people would buy that?
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.840]   There used to be an app that did that.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.840]   Something like that.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:49.280]   It was an email or texting app and it showed you behind the stuff that you were typing
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:55.400]   through the camera so you could see the hole that you're about to walk into.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:01.240]   Long as the problem is, it's the chewing gum and texting at the same time.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.240]   It's the speed slowdown.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.240]   Oh, God, I hate that.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.440]   And if it hits them, they'll just stop in the middle of nowhere.
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.600]   There was somebody driving.
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:15.640]   It was somebody at the gas station and I was waiting behind her to use the pump and she
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:16.800]   was pumping the gas.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:24.720]   She was on the phone, finished pumping and I just watched her like molasses slowly get
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:31.240]   into her car, waited like two minutes while she slowly buckled her seat because she's
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.240]   not there.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.240]   She's somewhere else.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:38.520]   She's not aware of what's going on in the world and she's talking.
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:44.040]   Among adults age 18 to 29, only 16% say it is okay to use your phone.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.040]   Yes.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.360]   I believe the children are our future.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.440]   My son used to do this.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:52.760]   He put the phone in his lap and he'd be at dinner like this and I'd say, "Henry, put
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:53.760]   the phone away."
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.760]   He said, "I'm not doing anything."
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:52:00.520]   "Henry, you're looking at your lap unless you've got something else going on.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.520]   I'm pretty sure you got a phone down there."
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:05.640]   I'm just teasing if I'm able, Dad.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:07.360]   Can I also get gross here?
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:14.320]   I mean, I don't want to get too gross, but if you're standing at a urinal, can you give
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.040]   your full attention to other things?
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:23.920]   I just don't get this and then the worst thing is you're done and you just walk out of the
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.920]   restroom.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.720]   It's like, "He's moved the sink."
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.440]   Oh, at least it's up.
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.160]   No, I need Google Glass.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.360]   I'm going to pay attention to one stream at a time.
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.280]   One stream at a time.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:37.520]   I remember vividly, I've told this story before as I apologize if you've heard it, but I'm
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.520]   in the men's room.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.640]   A guy, loudly, of course, that's the other problem is you're always loud.
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:45.400]   They're loudly talking on the phone at the urinal, drops it into the urinal.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.400]   Yes.
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.640]   I'm seeing the other people in the men's room cover their mouth.
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:53.840]   I think it was at a Google I have covering their mouth laughing.
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:56.360]   And all wishing they had their phones out so they could have taken a picture.
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:57.960]   They all thought it was great.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:52:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:03.160]   Did he retrieve it?
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.160]   Was it disgusting?
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.160]   He doesn't want to prove?
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:08.160]   Geez.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:09.160]   That's gross.
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.160]   That's gross.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:13.160]   If he had one of the new Sony phones, it probably would have been okay.
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:14.160]   That's right.
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.000]   That's why all my phones are gold from now on.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000]   I don't.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000]   Let's take a break and then.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000]   It's a second place.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000]   It's your fault Danny.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.120]   You did this Danny.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.080]   You brought us here.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:26.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.280]   It's usually my role Danny.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.280]   You did it.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.600]   You brought us here.
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:34.600]   They have oleophobic coatings.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.640]   They need ureaphobic coatings.
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.640]   I need that.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.680]   Our show today brought to you by and they're sure happy to be here.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:42.680]   Braintree.
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.680]   Braintreepayments.com.
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:48.240]   I actually think braintree is so cool.
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:54.440]   If you've ever used Uber or Lyft or Airbnb or GitHub or StubHub, you have used braintree
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:55.960]   payments.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:02.000]   Braintree enables mobile app developers and website developers to add payment solutions
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.880]   that your customers will adore and you will like.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:10.840]   I use StubHub all the time and the ability to just very easily pay and with every kind
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:14.400]   of payment is what makes it great.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:17.320]   You don't want to design your own shopping cart.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.960]   That's going to let you in for trouble.
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:25.000]   In fact, mobile cart abandonment is like the number one problem with e-commerce on mobile
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.240]   is people just go, "I don't know what's going on or I can't trust it or it's slow or it's
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.440]   not safe or not.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.160]   I just don't feel right."
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:34.880]   With braintree, you never have that problem.
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:36.440]   That's why Uber uses it.
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.040]   Uber's secret sauce is how easy it is to pay.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.520]   In fact, it's not just Uber.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.160]   It's Lyft.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:43.960]   It's Airbnb and hotels tonight.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:44.960]   It's GitHub.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:46.280]   It's StubHub.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:49.200]   It's so many companies you've been using braintree all this time.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:52.520]   You didn't even know it.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:57.480]   Braintree accepts payments from PayPal, of course, Apple Pay, of course, Bitcoin, yeah,
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.320]   by Coinbase.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.640]   Venmo works with the braintree.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.600]   Of course, credit cards work with braintree.
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:09.680]   That A word will be working with braintree, the A word pay.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.480]   Some reason, even though it says on the site Android Pay, we accept that.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:17.240]   They don't want me to say the Android Pay word, but they've got a little robot right
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.440]   there on the site.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:22.720]   I got to get my wife to bake me an A word pie.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.520]   They sound good.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.080]   Maybe that's because it's not quite there.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.840]   Because Android Pay is there, yeah.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.680]   As soon as Android Pay is out, though, and this is what's great about not writing it
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:38.600]   yourself, you've got really good people at braintree doing the coding, 10 lines of code.
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:44.600]   It works with every mobile platform, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and on and on and on.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.640]   You can try it yourself in the sandbox at braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.240]   And by the way, they scale beautifully.
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:56.440]   Fast payouts, superior fraud protection, great customer service.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.480]   Your customers will never be waiting.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:55:59.480]   It's fast.
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:01.600]   That's what everybody wants, isn't it?
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.680]   And if you need a little more incentive, your first $50,000 in transactions will be
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.040]   fee free when you go to braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.480]   We really love braintree payments.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:15.360]   I just think they're just so cool.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.360]   It works so well.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.720]   And I want you to try it.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.720]   Braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:25.120]   And they're really great guys and they're fans and they really wanted to support the
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.880]   show and I'm grateful to them.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.880]   Thank you.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:30.800]   Braintreepay, I asked the CTO.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.000]   And Braintree, Massey said, "No, no."
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.920]   The founders just love the word braintree.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:37.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:40.200]   They're in Chicago and San Francisco.
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.560]   Braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:45.920]   All right, who wants to start?
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.960]   Normally, I'll tell you what, you're--
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:49.640]   Well, can I mention one other story?
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.640]   Yes.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:51.640]   You did it in Windows.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:52.640]   We didn't do it in this one.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.640]   But I tried it.
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:59.080]   Going back to those-- trying to get you to download apps, Amazon on the middle level
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.160]   of course wants you to download their app platform.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.160]   And I always refuse.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.160]   Now I always get tricked.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.680]   But I found the reason to do it, which is on the rundown, which is that I can now download
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:12.560]   Amazon Prime's app on my tablet in addition to Google Play.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:13.560]   So it's great.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.280]   It's some stuff I already pay for and it's there.
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:21.280]   And I download like crazy because I'm on planes and in trains and in tunnels.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.240]   And it works.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:28.680]   That's a good point because you are always in underground or in the air.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:29.680]   One or the other.
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:30.680]   I'm never at sea level.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:32.240]   And you need the Amazon video app.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:35.920]   It has to be on a fire tablet, fire phone, Amazon--
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:36.920]   No, no, no, no.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:37.920]   No, I'm going on.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:38.920]   I'm going on.
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:39.920]   I say.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:44.560]   iTunes and Android, you have to be a Prime member.
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:46.640]   And by the way, it doesn't sit on your phone forever.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:50.640]   I think you have 30 days.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:52.760]   And there you go.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:59.720]   You can watch them-- any of the Prime movies, thousands of eligible movies, including transparent.
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.920]   So there you go.
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:08.120]   Wherever you go, download from iPhone and iPad to Fire tablet in Android.
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:11.040]   Yeah, that is a nice thing.
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:15.320]   Jeff, do you want to give us a number?
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.960]   Oh, any media, my name, Mo.
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:21.040]   I'll pick this one.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:24.920]   Publishers will soon be able to tell when you're bored and thus give you the appropriate
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:26.680]   kind of content.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:29.680]   Mm.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.560]   Research from-- well, I can tell from my behavior zone.
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:34.560]   Right.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:35.560]   I'm doing this.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:36.560]   Oh, you have a short attendance span.
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.120]   I'm pointless.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:42.320]   And so one of my most likely to read stuff, which basically is how buzz people take over
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:44.000]   the world.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.240]   So add boredom detection that list of strategies publishers will use.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:56.200]   Apps that are most strongly correlated with being bored were Instagram, email, settings,
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:59.320]   built-in browser, and apps in the other category.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:04.040]   Apps that correlated most strongly with not being bored were communication apps, though
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:06.120]   emails, one of them, I would think.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:09.720]   Facebook, oddly, that's kind of what I am bored is when I'm doing Facebook.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:12.240]   SMS and Google Chrome.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:15.200]   When you're Chrome, I guess you're purposeful.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.200]   Mm.
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.200]   That's weird.
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.280]   And how do they know what you're using?
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:26.640]   I was in a study where the telephonica and research in Spain did this.
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:30.600]   Oh, but so somebody who's on my phone can't tell what I'm doing?
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:34.560]   No, they looked at correlation to boredom.
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.480]   Mail and get this, surprise this.
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.560]   Mail participants tended to be more bored than females.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:45.720]   And boredom was higher for the participants in their 20s and 40s and lower in their 30s.
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:53.360]   So there's a bell curve of boredom.
[01:59:53.360 --> 02:00:00.240]   I am not bored because I have my smartphone and I can always be doing other things.
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:04.800]   So I feel like that's-- they're going to give me short stories.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:05.800]   Is that why?
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:06.800]   How they're going to do that?
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:07.800]   Shorter stories?
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:08.800]   I'm bored.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:09.800]   They'll give you things to amuse you.
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:10.800]   More cat pictures.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.800]   That's when you get cats.
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:12.800]   Yeah, that's exactly when you get cats.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:13.800]   I'm bored.
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:14.800]   Oh, fine.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:19.920]   So is it that you're only supposed to post cat pictures on cat today?
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:20.920]   I don't know.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:24.680]   If you're going to have a day, you should only be allowed to post cat pictures on that.
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:26.680]   Every day is cat or a day.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:27.680]   I know.
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:30.760]   I know.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.120]   Do you have anything you want to tell us about Danny?
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:34.120]   Pick a tip or--
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:35.120]   I do.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:36.120]   I do.
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:37.680]   Hey, fun fact.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:40.640]   If you search for fun fact on Google, you get fun facts.
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.640]   Oh.
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:43.840]   That's a fun fact.
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.880]   It's cool.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:50.040]   You just search for fun facts.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.560]   What is the most common element on Earth?
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.560]   Oxygen.
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:58.720]   Why is the leak the national symbol of whales?
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:00:59.720]   Oh.
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:00.720]   Oh.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:02.880]   Well, I shouldn't know that I have a leak cat.
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:03.880]   I shouldn't.
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:04.880]   Oh, good.
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:07.400]   It has to do with Shakespeare, right?
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:08.480]   Have a leak.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.480]   I got a leak.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.480]   State.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.480]   St.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.480]   St.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:18.440]   On the eve of battle with Saxons to wear the leaks, caps, so as to easily distinguish
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:19.960]   themselves friend from foe.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:20.960]   It was a uniform.
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:21.960]   What?
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:22.960]   The leak?
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:23.960]   The leak.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:24.960]   I just know that they--
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.880]   Give me my leak cat.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.760]   You know, this is the kind of thing they should be giving us when they detect that
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:31.760]   we're bored.
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:32.760]   This is fun facts.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.760]   Fun facts.
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:35.080]   You know, they're little snippets.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:37.040]   They're interesting, much better than--
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:39.280]   If I refresh, do I get a new fun fact?
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.280]   Yes, I will.
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.560]   Which animals cannot walk backwards?
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:44.960]   Emus and kangaroos cannot walk backwards.
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:47.920]   Everybody else can walk backwards.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:50.520]   That's really sad.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:51.520]   That's from the naked scientists.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:53.120]   What do they get stuck in front of a wall?
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.120]   What do they--
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.120]   Why, they're stuck?
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:56.120]   That's it.
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.120]   That's it for the rest of the lives.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.120]   Which--
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:02.520]   Why are objects in the mirror closer?
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:03.720]   Because it's convex.
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:04.720]   Right.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:05.720]   Okay.
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:06.720]   That's exactly right.
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:07.720]   Back to your other one.
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:10.440]   Which is the only bird that can fly backwards and forward?
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.440]   Oh.
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.440]   What?
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.160]   They must know you're bored.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.000]   It is the ruby-throated hummingbird.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.800]   It can or cannot fly backwards.
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:20.800]   No, it can.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:21.800]   Can.
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.800]   Can.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:26.600]   Why is Leo wearing a leak?
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:28.800]   Oh my God.
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:30.800]   You thought I was joking.
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:31.840]   I thought that.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:35.280]   This is so that during the battle, I know that I am friend.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:39.760]   Why do you have a leak hat?
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.760]   And who found it?
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:43.360]   You have a bonus to ever found that.
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:45.160]   Some Welshmen brought it to me.
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.120]   Oh my goodness.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.120]   Oh wait a minute.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.720]   Photo op.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:53.720]   We could have a whole solid.
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:54.720]   Did they have different--
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:57.280]   What did Canadians call Canadian bacon in Canada?
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.400]   What to back bacon?
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:00.880]   They call it back bacon.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:01.880]   Back bacon.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.240]   Who said we don't have leaks on this show?
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:04.240]   Who is--
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:08.600]   What is the oldest man on earth?
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:10.720]   Guinness Book of World Records says the oldest person living
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:15.720]   Missao Okawa, 115-year-old Japanese woman.
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:20.720]   The oldest verified age ever, 122 years and 164 days.
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:23.720]   Jean-Clamom, a France who died in 1997.
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.720]   The problem is that's the problem with being the oldest person.
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:26.720]   That's right.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:27.720]   This could change any second.
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.720]   So here's a really interesting one.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:31.720]   How fast is a crack in glass travel?
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:33.720]   Oh, speed of sound.
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:35.720]   3,000 miles an hour.
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:36.720]   Wow.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:37.720]   A little less than a speed of sound.
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:39.720]   Why do they call it a white elephant?
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:40.720]   Why?
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:43.720]   Because it's a burdensome gift.
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:48.720]   Supposedly after the King of Siam, gifted, god damn it, gave is fine.
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:54.720]   Rare albino-elivistic courtiers who had displeased him that they might be ruined by the animal's upkeep costs.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.720]   Well, there you go.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.720]   What do you call a group of unicorns?
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.720]   Oh, that's a good one.
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:00.720]   I know that one.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:02.720]   Silicon Valley startups.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:03.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:05.720]   Not always.
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:07.720]   A blessing.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.720]   A blessing of unicorns.
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:12.720]   And in that note, I give you all my blessing.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:13.720]   Wait a minute.
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:14.720]   We haven't asked Mike Elgin.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:15.720]   We haven't asked Mike Elgin.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:16.720]   What do you want us to share with us today?
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.720]   I got a great one.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:18.720]   A couple of tools.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.720]   If you could assist me and go to google docs, docs.google.com.
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:23.720]   Yes.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:30.720]   And Google today rolled out some really great features for Google Docs, including the voice transcription.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:31.720]   Wow.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:32.720]   So they've only got voice typing.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.720]   So what you'll see and also templates.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:36.720]   So they have all the kinds of like a resume template.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.720]   So should I create a new doc here?
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.720]   A new doc.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:40.720]   You see the templates on the top of this.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.720]   Oh, an annual budget, monthly budget calendar.
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:44.720]   Look at all of these.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:45.720]   Yeah, lots of templates.
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:46.720]   Nice.
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:48.720]   This is a very common sense thing that they probably could have been shut away.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:51.720]   I mean, Microsoft Office has done this for years.
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:57.720]   But the voice typing feature works really great and it supports 40 languages or something like that.
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:04:59.720]   Can I do it in a spreadsheet or do I need a...
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.720]   Go ahead.
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:01.720]   I think so.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:02.720]   Either way.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:03.720]   You know, I think it works.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.720]   I've gotten sheets somehow.
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:05.720]   Let's go back to docs.
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:06.720]   Okay.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.720]   Now go into tools.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:10.720]   Doc.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:11.720]   Okay.
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:12.720]   Tools.
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:13.720]   Okay.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:14.720]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.720]   And choose voice typing.
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.720]   Look at that.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:17.720]   It's a really cool interface too.
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:21.720]   So if you click on the black microphone, it'll turn colored into a colored microphone.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:24.720]   And now everything we say will be...
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.720]   After you approve the microphone, now everything we say will be typed out.
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:28.720]   And it works really well.
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:34.720]   You can do things like next paragraph.
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:38.720]   And it should go to the next paragraph.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.720]   Or it will type, it should go to the next paragraph.
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:42.720]   Exclamation points.
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.720]   Actually it's not my mic, it's here.
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.720]   Oh yeah, of course.
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:45.720]   She's not my wife.
[02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:46.720]   She's not my wife.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:47.720]   She's here.
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:48.720]   She's not.
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:49.720]   My wife is here.
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:52.720]   But she just left.
[02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:53.720]   Anyway.
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:56.720]   I wonder if you could use this to transcribe a tape.
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:57.720]   Just play the tape.
[02:05:57.720 --> 02:05:58.720]   It's pretty good.
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:05:59.720]   It doesn't work.
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:00.720]   Yeah.
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.720]   In fact, in fact, why can't I just put in an audio file into Google Docs?
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:04.720]   Yeah.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:06.720]   Have a transcribed this.
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.720]   Hey, hey, hey, go go.
[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.720]   Well you have that one for free.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:11.720]   Yeah.
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:13.720]   There's a free one.
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:14.720]   New paragraph.
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:15.720]   New paragraph.
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:17.720]   I think it's stuck.
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:18.720]   It was working for us.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:19.720]   It's saving now.
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:20.720]   Okay, I had to save.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:22.720]   Now it's going to continue on.
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:23.720]   Alexa.
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:25.720]   Okay.
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:28.720]   You can say period and new line.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:30.720]   Oh, there's no new line.
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:31.720]   Got it.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:32.720]   New line.
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:35.720]   As we'll see, new paragraph goes to a new paragraph.
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:37.720]   Like is there any way to move back?
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:39.720]   A new line goes to a new line.
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:40.720]   I think there is.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.720]   Let me see.
[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:42.720]   Yeah.
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:43.720]   New line.
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:50.720]   There's a short list of things that you can do for navigation and for putting punctuation
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:51.720]   and things like that.
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:52.720]   I'm not sure if that's on there.
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:53.720]   But it's a nice feature.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.720]   It's built in if we're already using Docs.
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:07:00.720]   I love voice transcription, although I can never force myself to get in the habit of using
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:01.720]   it.
[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:07.720]   Of course, we already mentioned the templates and within the Android version of Docs now,
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.720]   you can do research from directly in the Docs.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:13.720]   It'll go find third party content based on your searches.
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:16.720]   But again, that's Android only.
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:22.720]   So check that out on the Docs app in Android.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:28.920]   I want to thank Tommy Hermanson, who has been listening to the show, and created a new logo
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:38.120]   for us based on the new Google logo and no comic sand apparently is involved.
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:39.120]   Thank you, Tommy.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:40.800]   I like it.
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:43.040]   I like the bolts.
[02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:46.280]   We can, because as you can see, our old logo still has serifs.
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:47.280]   Yes.
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:50.200]   It takes us a little longer than Google to redesign our logos.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.200]   Yes.
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:52.200]   Yes.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.240]   We do this week and by the way, let me thank everybody.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:55.720]   Thank you, Mike Elgin, for being here.
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:58.720]   You're going to have a busy week because Microsoft just announced that they're going
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:03.280]   to stream their EFA news conference 7am Friday.
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:05.280]   You don't want to get up early in the year.
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.280]   No, no, no.
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:07.280]   What the heck?
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.680]   Lots of EFA coverage going on.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:15.160]   Actually, Tommy is from Berlin and he says, "When you go to EFA, go to the Augustin Air
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:18.920]   Brow Hall and the Ampacos beer garden."
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:19.920]   I love those things.
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:20.920]   Those are the best places to go.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:21.920]   That's the best place to go.
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:22.920]   That's the best place to go to trade shows in Germany.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:23.920]   Yep.
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:25.920]   The beer and the brats.
[02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:26.920]   Yeah.
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:27.920]   You're going to EFA?
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:28.920]   No.
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:29.920]   No one's going to EFA.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:30.920]   Tommy's there.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.080]   He's going to drink giant glasses of beer so we don't have it.
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.480]   Just for us.
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:37.480]   What else?
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.480]   Thank you very much.
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:39.480]   Good to have you.
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:40.480]   Thank you.
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:45.320]   Make sure everybody tunes in Monday through Friday, 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern timed, 1700
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:46.880]   UTC for TNT.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:48.840]   The world's greatest tech news show.
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:51.280]   The world's greatest tech news show.
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:53.680]   Tech news today.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:54.680]   Exactly.
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:58.840]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York where he's a professor of journalism,
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.920]   a blogger at Buzzmachine.com, the author of many books including What Would Google Do,
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.400]   Public Parts, Gutenberg, The Geek, and his latest.
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:08.560]   He brings gifts out as an audible book.
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:09.800]   If you go audible, you can buy it.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:11.440]   You can hear these dulce of tones.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:13.000]   And he's already.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.040]   And his next book, What Did Google Do?
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.600]   What the hell did Alphabet do?
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:19.080]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:20.080]   The BFG.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:22.120]   It's always a pleasure.
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:23.680]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:26.360]   And of course, the great Danny Sullivan, some search engine land.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:27.920]   We love having Danny on the show.
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:30.960]   He's been a Google watcher since before the beginning.
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.920]   Did you get the little Brio train with the Google letters?
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:36.240]   No, I'm very jealous about that.
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:37.240]   I don't have that.
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:38.840]   I have a widest assortment of various things.
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:39.840]   I know you do.
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:43.200]   But not the Brio train, so I've seen that.
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:44.200]   Pretty sweet.
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:45.200]   Very cool.
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.200]   I wonder where it is.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.200]   Is it in the basement?
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.640]   Maybe, Burke, have you seen a little wooden train tracks with little Google train cars
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:52.640]   on them?
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:55.800]   I think I lost them.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:56.800]   That's shocking.
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:59.880]   It was so well on eBay.
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:05.880]   Well, you could make a new one because they just buy G-O-G-L-N-E.
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:06.880]   It's just like--
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:08.880]   Oh, I thought I was going to do an alphabet one now.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:10.320]   It wasn't anything special.
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.320]   That's the irony in this.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:12.320]   They just went shopping.
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:13.320]   They didn't have anything.
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:14.320]   They didn't have anything.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:17.680]   So here, this is for you.
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:22.200]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 11-- I'm sorry, 1 p.m. Pacific.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:28.080]   Maybe 1.30 depends on how busy we are in the morning with Windows Weekly.
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:34.640]   That, by the way, is 4.30 in the afternoon, east coast time, 20.30 UTC.
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:36.120]   Will I be here next week?
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:37.120]   No.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:38.120]   No.
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:39.120]   You're going to be a New York City.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.120]   I'm going to fill out my--
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:41.120]   Jason.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:42.120]   Jason's going to do the show.
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:43.120]   He's going to do the show.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.760]   I'm going to do the Apple show because we're reversing the day.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:47.520]   So next week it's going to be--
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:48.520]   Is that right, Jason, Tuesday?
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:50.920]   Yeah, that's the next Wednesday.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:52.560]   Next Wednesday is the Apple event.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:53.560]   Yeah, we do it.
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:54.560]   We'll be doing it.
[02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:55.560]   Followed by Mac McPhee.
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:56.560]   Weekly.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:57.560]   Followed by this weekend.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:58.560]   Gotcha.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.560]   And Jason, I'm going to be in Vienna.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.560]   So I hate--
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.800]   I was going to tell you to book two people because I don't know what I'll have my Chromebook
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:03.800]   and God knows.
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:04.800]   We'll see what happens.
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:05.800]   So maybe, Jeff, we--
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:06.800]   I wish I were going to meet up.
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:08.720]   OK, Gina is on next week.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:09.720]   Oh.
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:10.720]   Oh.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:11.720]   Well, everybody will be very happy about that.
[02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:12.720]   We don't really eat you.
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:13.720]   That's all you need, Gina.
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:14.720]   You don't need anybody else to do it.
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:15.720]   All we need.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:19.400]   I'll find one more person just to make a chunphy.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:20.400]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.400]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.980]   (upbeat music)
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:32.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
