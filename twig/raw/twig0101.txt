[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.200]   This week in Google, episode 101, recorded June 29th, 2011,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   inside Google+.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   This week in Google and boy, what a big Twig.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   This is gonna be, let me introduce our regular panelists first.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   >> It's Twig plus.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200]   >> It is Twig plus, literally.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   Jeff Jarvis is here from his office at the city university of New York.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200]   He's the author of course of what would Google do.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   And Professor of Journalism and Blogger@buzzmachined.com.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200]   Gina Trapani is also here from San Diego, California.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200]   She's at smarterware.org.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200]   She's been using this brand new thing for a full 24 hours.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200]   She's our expert.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   >> Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200]   >> But we do have two people on the show been using it longer.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   Let me introduce in the upper left hand corner Bradley Horowitz from Google.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   >> You know.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   >> Hey Bradley, and what is your relationship to Google+.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200]   >> Big fan, big fan.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   >> Big fan, now come on.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   I think you're a little more than that.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   >> Vice president of product and was part of the team that helped build this.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   >> That's fantastic.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200]   And Vic Gundotra, who's also very well known at Google.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   And I think a happy man right now.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   Hi Vic.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   Hello everybody.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200]   >> We also have kind of a hangout going on.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   I don't know if you know this, but we've got quite a few people, including Matt Cuts from
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   Google.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   I see Doug K there.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   There's quite a few people waving, Trey Rachliffe, Robert Scobel.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   Quite a few people in there.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   There's my, there's the werewolf.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   Okay.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   Dylan Field is in there and he was a werewolf, but he's not anymore.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   So this is a part of a Google+ call to hang out.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   Who wants to start?
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   Vic, do you want to start?
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   Or Bradley, do you want to give us, I need somebody to give me a thumbnail of what this
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   is.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   This is probably the biggest Google product launch in quite some time.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   So why don't I start off by just giving you a little bit of a description of what our goals
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   are.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Okay.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   And then we can dive into the various aspects of it.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   Okay.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   You know, so we recognize that a basic human need is a need to connect with other people.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   And of course we do that all the time.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   We smile.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   We talk.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   We cheer.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   We connect all the time in real life.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Unless like you're in solitary confinement.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   Right?
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   Right.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   But increasingly today, people are connecting with each other online.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   And yet when they connect online, their interactions are not like the real choices that they have.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   I'm starting to lose your audio.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   I'm not sure what's going on there, Vic.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Here's some background noise.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Do you hear me now?
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Let me cut the back.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   No, you're good.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   It's better.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   Is that better?
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   Okay.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Okay.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   Great.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   So, you know, when you look at the online choices that we have to connect with people, they often give you very rigid choices.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   One tool allows you to speak publicly to everyone in the world.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   Other tools force you to put all of your connections into a big bucket.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   And it turns out all those people are not really your friends.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   And so we thought, you know, there's got to be a way to do this better.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   And when we talk to our own friends, when we talk to our own families, when we look at market research,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   we consistently heard from people that they want to communicate with different circles.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   That in real life, how you communicate with your closest friends is different than how you communicate with your coworkers.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   How you communicate with your sister is different than how you communicate with a neighbor.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   And so we asked ourselves, why is it that that doesn't exist in software?
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   That that richness and nuance that we have in real world communications, why don't we express that in software?
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   And we recognize that in some respects, it's just hard.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   People don't like having to go create these circles.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   And so we really tried to develop a tool.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   And this tool is at the heart of the Google+ project, which is the ability to create these circles.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   And we had Andy Herzwald, who is one of the original members of the Macintosh design team,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   really helped lead a team that built a breakthrough UI that makes it very simple for you to not only have lots of connections in your life,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   but put them in the appropriate circles.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   You know, a family circle, a friend circle, a nap, a buddy circle.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   And then that concept is core to everything else that the product does.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   And I think you talked about hangouts, and since you're showing them here,
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   I'll briefly talk about how circles relate to hangouts.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   You know, we recognize that when groups of people want to connect, when you want to connect with people that matter in your life,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   today that is largely a newsfeed or stream-based activity.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   We asked ourselves, "Why can't you go higher fidelity?
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   Why can't you do group video chat with the people that matter in your life?"
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   And we argued that there was three things that were holding back group video chat.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   One is it's expensive.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   You have to pay for group multi-user video.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   Number two, it's complex.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   You have to call your father and help him install the software and get through the permissions
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   and, you know, shut down the antivirus and it's too complicated.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   And we said, "What if we made it free and what if we made it easy, would then people do group video chat?"
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   And we said, "No, because there's a third reason why people don't connect that way."
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   And that's because of the social awkwardness problem.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   You know, you try to do group video chat and you send someone an invite message,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   and maybe they're not dressed appropriately, and then, you know, then they have to say, "No."
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   And your request is rejected, and you feel bad about interrupting them.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   And so what we decided was what happens in real life?
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   In real life, people give subtle social signals that they're available to chat.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   You know, it's unlikely we're going to knock on our neighbor's door at eight o'clock at night just to say hello,
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   because we might be interrupting them.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   But if our neighbor is sitting on a porch, well, we're much more likely to go, you know, hello, Bob,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   because his sitting on a porch is a subtle signal that it's okay to talk.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   And if two neighbors, if Bob is sitting on his porch and your other neighbor, Mark, is talking to him,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   then it's almost rude to walk by and not say hello.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   And so we built that into software with Google+, when you start a hangout,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   a notice gets put into the stream, and you can decide which circle gets to see that.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Maybe just your family circle or your nappa buddy circle or all your circles.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   All of them get to see that you're hanging out on your porch.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   And whenever someone's available, why they can join you.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   And it's amazing. We see the exact same dynamic.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   As soon as two people are in a hangout, pretty soon three people join,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   and it turns into a party very, very quickly, and we support up to 10 people in a video hangout at no charge.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   So that's a quick overview of the Google+ project and one aspect of the Google+ project hangouts.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   Wow, thank you, Vic.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   And as for people watching the video, as we went through this, we showed a little bit of my interface to this.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.200]   It is -- it was very easy to set up. There's a plug-in you download.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   And it really is. It's kind of amazing. I'll turn up the audio briefly so you can hear it.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   There are 10 people in there. So it's kind of a party going on.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   Now, I could have swelled with a snowball.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   There's a party.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   Switche.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   We are.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   No, no, no.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   Now we're on the floor.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   Everyone goes quiet.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   Everybody got quiet. It's really -- it's quite a thing going on in there. Hey, Robert Scobel.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   And I noticed Vic also the focus shifts automatically to the person who's speaking.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   There's Matt Cuts.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   You also can mute your mics and you can mute mics.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   I'll be right back.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   You're being very noisy and disturbing the room. It's really, really well done.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   Ah, so that got quieter when I did that. That's Robert Scobel explaining how this stuff works.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   So you would never mute you, Robert.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   And there's an empty chair. Apparently talking right now.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   So you launched this Vic yesterday. Is that right?
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Yeah, we went to limited field trial mode yesterday.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   How limited? Who's -- it seems like a lot of people I know are on here.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   Scobel's already added a thousand friends.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Of course.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   Mostly Googlers?
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   I think the friends that he added were people that were already part of our initial seed.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   Okay.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   And we chose the initial seed very carefully. We wanted a lot of diversity.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   So we have people that represent over 42 of the world's languages that are in that initial seed.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   Trying to really test the product, make sure that we meet people's privacy expectations,
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   that the systems that are working, that we can scale, and will slowly grow that initial seed as we're ready.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   People can get -- or ask for an invitation by going to the website.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   Yes.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   When you get it, you suddenly get on your Google -- well, actually I think everybody's getting this now.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   This black bar. Is everybody getting that on their Google page?
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   Yes.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Yes.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   So this black bar is a new part of the interface here.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   But if you are part of the plus experiment, you'll get the -- maybe I should call it experiment -- the plus --
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   Project.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   Project.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   There we go.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   I think I gather not fully experimental, although my computer apparently is.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   You'll get the plus and your name there, and you can click that to go right to plus.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   How many people -- how quickly do you plan to roll this out more publicly?
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   How many people are going to be involved?
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   So we're not disclosing any numbers right now.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   We're just working with our initial seed. We're watching how the systems react.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   We're measuring certain characteristics, and we'll have more announcements in the future.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   And the thing that everyone asked last night, and it's been asking me today that I asked probably last night,
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   is apps yet? No, not yet.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   But it feels -- you know, as I play with the stream, it feels kind of very face-booky, very friend-feedy, or buzz in a way.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   And yet also more social.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   You do really -- I think the circles really does solve that list-making problem.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   Even Mark Zuckerberg has said that we want different groups, but nobody wants to make lists.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   This kind of crag-and-drop interface really is kind of fun to be able to.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   Yeah, it really is.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   Hey, Leo, that's what we were trying to do, is we were trying to eliminate the awkwardness that some of these tools have.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   Right.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   And so we tried to make the circles fun, but you'll see that subtlety all through the product.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   And I think you mentioned earlier that in Hangouts, the camera switches automatically.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   You know, we realize that the higher-end telecommunications services that corporations use often have this camera switch capability.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   And so we tried to bring that down, because in the real world, people interrupt each other's conversations,
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   and the conversation jumps around.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   And so the software recognizes that the conversation is jumping around,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   and it tries to move the video with that, which I think provides a really fun experience.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   Are you using Vidjo as a back-end for this?
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   We are not.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   I'm assuming you're referring to some of the codec work that we're using.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   Well, you use, I was under the impression that G-Talk uses the Vidjo as...
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   But this is not that.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   We are not disclosing which codecs we're using at this time,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   because we're actually experimenting with a couple of different options,
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   and as we go through field trial, we'll make various engineering trade-offs.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.200]   Hangout also allows you to jointly watch YouTube videos.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   Gina, you said you were doing that last night.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   Yeah, it works really well.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   If you watch a YouTube video together, if someone skips ahead, the person you're watching with
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   skips ahead, that happens for you too.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   It's very much an insane kind of...
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   It's a group activity you're doing with your friends.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   And I would love to see screen sharing.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   I'd like to pay a program in a hangout.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   I'd like to use a whiteboard and listen to music.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   So it's a neat... I really like the YouTube functionality a lot.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   I want to see it do more.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   Matt's playing with his bucky balls right now.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   You can see the fun element of this, but Trey Radcliffe, who's a photographer
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   and has a website stuck in customs.com and uses hangout or has been using
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   with his work friends who are distributed all over the country.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   He said it's also very useful for them, because they just leave it up and running
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   and then as they need to communicate, they can.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.200]   So this isn't pure fun.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   But it seems to be that when it came to work versus fun and the release so far,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   fun won.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   Bradley, I take it you've been using this...
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   Yes, fun always wins, doesn't it?
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   You've been using this for a while.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   Have you... as you've used it and as you've seen new people come on,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   have the use cases changed, shifted a little bit?
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   Are you surprised?
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   It's how sometimes people are using this?
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   Well, I think the most surprising thing about hangouts was that even though
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   for the last few months as we've been testing this, we've been trapped in a work scenario,
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   it's just been our colleagues.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   Fun, just sort of erupted.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   All kinds of traditions emerged around hangouts.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   Vic, even other executives, there we go, Matt Cutz's...
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   (laughter)
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   This behavior, for some reason, you put people in a hangout like this and
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   all kinds of hilarious behavior ensues.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   People were in hangout for hours and hours because once the
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   originator leaves the hangout, the hangout can keep going.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   I like that actually.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   Last eight hours.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   Yeah, Robert Scobble was mentioning that and I think that that's a subtle but valuable
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   feature of this.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   Nobody owns it.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Very good design decisions.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   I'm going to make a sign that says I'm with stupid and hold it up when I go
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   on a hangout now.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   (laughter)
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.200]   So we have... this is hangout.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   We've shown you circles as well and then there's stream,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   which is a stream of content going down and then there's sparks.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   What?
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   Tell us about sparks, Bradley.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   What is this?
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   So Google knows a lot about the content that's on the web.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   Obviously through services like Google Search and Google News, we have
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   fresh up to the minute content.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   Sparks allows you to express your interests, your sort of durable interest.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   I'm interested in hiking or scuba diving or whatever esoteric interest you
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   want.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   There's a free text search there and we will bring you fresh topical content
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   suitable for sharing.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   So if I type in IBM to the sparks interface there, we're not going to bring
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   you the Wikipedia page for IBM or navigational queries for IBM.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   We're going to bring you up to the minute news stories regarding IBM that are
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   topical and meaningful for today.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   So we think that one of the things we want to do with this product, it turns
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   out to be really great for conversation.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   It's, you know, in other networks it can be sometimes hard to have a meaningful
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   threaded conversation.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   You can do that here and we want to sort of give people an icebreaker, spark
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   to the conversation and then allow them to have meaningful conversations that
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   aren't filled with spam or random people sort of chiming in but are contained
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   in these circles and we've certainly seen that in our testing that sort of
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   goes up level the quality of conversation.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   So it's not Google alerts.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   In fact, it looks like this is going almost a search of Google news.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   Is that accurate?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.200]   Is it a subset of Google news?
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   Google news is included.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   The corpus behind this is custom.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   So it's nothing you've seen before and we're continuing to tune it and figure
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   out what content belongs in sparks, whether it's YouTube videos or news
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   stories or blog postings.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   All of that is fair game and then we're tuning the relevance.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   The things you may want to share with other people might be different than
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   the things you might want to read privately.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   So we're continuing to use machine learning to tune the relevance to bring
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   things that inspire this kind of sharing.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   This is, so I'll, so I've added two interests.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   I've added movies and Android.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   When I go to sparks now, will I see a stream of movies and Android?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   No, I continue to see these, these suggestions.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   Oh, and you're left hand column.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   You're left hand column.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   So I'll have to, so there's no collation of all of them off.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   I'll do one by the way.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   I mean, Leo, you're right on.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   I mean, the welcome screen that you see there is basically a placeholder.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   We will do something much better and more interesting than that.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   But when you click on sparks right now, you see those suggestions,
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   sparks, those, you know, cycling and Paris.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   We're just trying to give people a flavor for what the product can do.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   But you can imagine that we will have a much better combined relevance
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   rank stream that will be a better experience for you.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   Now, this is always, it's funny because on this show for a long time,
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   we've, one of the complaints I've had, I said,
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   Google needs to hire fewer computer scientists and more social scientists,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   because now we've got all these great technologies, but it's so complicated
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   for an end user to, to, to, to grok what's going on and to implement it.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   And it's clear that Andy and, and your team have put a lot of effort
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   into thinking about how humans will use this.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   But it sounds like this is an evolving interface.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   This isn't, you don't consider this done by any means.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   Oh, absolutely. I mean, feel trial is the right term.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   We're not, that's not a euphemism.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   There's a lot of rough edges in there and a lot of learning we have to do.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   So the feedback we've gotten in the first 24 hours has been tremendous.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   I mean, even if it's stuff we've heard before, the chorus of people debating it.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   And, you know, all of that informs how we prioritize getting to this work.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   So our year is to the ground and we're very excited about the level of engagement
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   and the feedback we're getting from folks.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   One more feature to mention, and this is the photo sharing feature.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   And it's essentially, is it automatic? This is what I'm not sure.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   Vic, would you explain how photos works?
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   Yeah, sure. We had this insight after talking with, like I said, our friends
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   and doing some basic research, is that people were finding that they had photos
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   and videos that were abandoned on their phones.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   And when we asked them, why didn't you just copy the videos and photos over?
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   They said it was just too hard.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   Sinking your phone to your computer, recognizing it as a USB device,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   copying the images onto your machine, putting them scaled or down
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   into the right program and then sharing it in mail, this was just all too complex.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   And so we put in a feature called Instant Upload.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   And for Android devices, that means with your permission,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   whenever you take a picture or you have a video,
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   we will upload those in the background to a private album.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   And it turns out to be a very magical experience.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   If you come back then to your computer, any picture that you have taken
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   in the last eight hours is instantly available for you to share.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   It literally shows you small thumbnails.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   And you can just select those thumbnails from the party last night
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.200]   and you can just share them really easily.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   People who have used this feature claim that they're addicted to it.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   It really simplifies the entire workflow of using your mobile phone as a camera
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   and then later sharing those assets.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   Currently Android. Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   You're explicitly choosing what to share.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   That's correct. Everything is put into the front.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   But nothing gets shared automatically.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   It's just kind of important.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   Yeah. Because people do all sorts of things with their camera phones.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   They may not want to share publicly.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   Vicker Bradley, talk a little bit about the...
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   I mean, one of the memes about this so far has been that it's...
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   I won't compare you to Facebook on privacy,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   but there's a lot of privacy caught in this.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   Vick said, "Thank you."
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   Well, of course, I want to mention here that I have a book called Public Parts
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   coming out September 27th, Simon & Schuster.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   But we'll get past that.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   What's the privacy goal of Plus?
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   So, Bradley, you want to take this or you want me to start?
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   Sure. I'll take this.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   I mean, I think one of the things we tried to do was understand users' unmet needs.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   And Gina wrote a really wonderful, thoughtful post this morning.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   Some of this is informed by mistakes of our past.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   Some of it is informed by primary research we did with users.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   But people really do care about how they are represented online.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   And the current systems fail to meet many users' needs.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   We heard this again and again as we asked.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   And one of the things we tried to do was make privacy not something that's sort of nine settings deep,
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   where you sort of set it and forget it, but to pull the basic tenets of visibility
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   and who's in the room and these kind of things that the physical world has.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   And the things that the physical world sets.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   In the physical world, we have walls.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   And I know that if I'm in the room with three people, my sound isn't going to go through the walls
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   and reach people on the other side.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   And in the online world, it hasn't felt like that to date.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   When I look at a share box, I really have no idea who's going to sort of receive this on the other end.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   And so we're just trying to reintroduce some of these basic concepts like specifying an audience
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   or when I take a right gesture to comment on something, I deserve to see who's in the room
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   and who can see this at that moment in time.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   So privacy is different.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   It's not like a setting.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   It's an approach toward building the product that sort of integrates this in at a feature level.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   And we think that's something users want.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   I want to let you guys go because I know we're using your time
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   and we really, really, really want to thank you for being part of this.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   But before I go, I should ask a question that our chat room is asking,
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   particularly about APIs, access to this data, is there a fire hose?
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   People can get, you know, this is one of the complaints people have about Twitter.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   Certainly you've had about Facebook is lack of access to this data.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.200]   Who owns this data?
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   How can we get to it?
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   Is there an API?
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   So obviously we are a platforms company.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   We believe that the data belongs to the user.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   And so you should expect those APIs to become available.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   Right now we're in field trial mode and our primary focus is on building a great experience.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.200]   If it isn't a great experience, there will be no users.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   And if there are no users, the API access won't matter.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   And so we're really focused on making sure that it's a great experience.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   But you can be assured that we are also going to have a platform,
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   in fact, we're simultaneously working on that.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   And we'll have something to announce in the future.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   Absolutely critical.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   And finally, how can our viewers get invitations?
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   You got any invites for us?
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   You can go to plus.google.com and you can sign up.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   We have an unbelievable number of people already signing up.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   I bet you do.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   And just be patient with us.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   I think what we've done is we've created an unprecedented demand for this.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   Because I think as people look at this and how you can use it,
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   and the hangouts and just the features, I think there's an unprecedented demand for this.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   Yeah, clearly this is going to get more real than more of my friends I can actually have on.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   I mean, I have a disproportionate number of Google friends, which I'm really quite enjoying.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   I'm getting into a whole new world.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   But I can't get the full sense of it until I get more of my world in there.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   So the sooner it's big, sooner it's real.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   You bet.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   Your team has been doing an unbelievable job of customer support answering questions.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   I mean, almost every thread.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   I've seen so many threads and even hangouts where Google's are hopping in and answering questions.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   Really, please pass on to them that I think they're doing an unbelievable job.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   Gina, like you, the fact that you gave such good advice to your users,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   people like Mark Pinkis gave as long suggestions about what to do.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   It's really impressive to see in a beta culture when you put it like suggestions and to help people give you.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   I also want to thank you for the Android app and ask, is there an iOS app in the future or other platforms?
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   Yes, there is an iOS app.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   What a surprise.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   I figured there was, but I figured I should also ask.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   I was just playing with this on Ileans Nexus One.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   I'm going to put it on my Android phone immediately as well.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   You want it because of Huddle. Huddle is the Android app only, which is really neat.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   I can't wait until my lunch buddies are all have the Huddle app installed because then we'll get to it.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.200]   Yes, and the Huddle app will be available in the iPhone version as well.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   And it also works with your friends who just have plain old SMS on their phone.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   Awesome.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   That's what I wanted to hear.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   We didn't mention Huddle. Huddle is kind of a good Huddle.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   It's group messaging, right?
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   Group text messaging.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   Yes.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   Well, guys, thank you for having us on the show.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   Thank you.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   Senior Vice President for Social for Google.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   Bradley Horowitz, Vice President for a product at Google.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate the time you spent talking about this.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   And congratulations on an exciting launch.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   Thank you guys.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   Take care.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   Bye-bye.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   Plus one.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   I still have my badge from a food camp. Thank you, Bradley.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   Now I know what it means.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   Unfortunately, when he gave me that plus one badge, I went, "I like this."
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   And I thought, "Forgive me."
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   No.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   You're always getting trouble, do y'all.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   Meanwhile, the hangout is still going.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   This is really, you know, I'm trying to be a calm journalist and not gush and a fuse over this.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   Trying to find the flaws.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   Trying to be negative.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   Especially after I said that part of me, Gina, wave was going to change the world.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   Gina, in her article, said that right up front, you know, that she's a little gun shy.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   We're all a little gun shy.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   What's very clear, they said it, but I think it's, it's bears repeating, is they have learned
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   a lot from buzz and from wave and from other launches that didn't go this well.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   In fact, that's the name of Gina's article.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   What Google plus learned from buzz and wave, what did they learn, Gina?
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   What are they doing better?
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   What are they doing right?
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   This product, these Google plus, this Google plus, we to products has a lot of good design
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   decisions that are very evident.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   And so in my article, I kind of run down, I mean, there are so many mistakes that were
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   made in buzz and wave, wave launching without email notifications to get people to come
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   back to it.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   You know, as soon as, as soon as the press was saying, "Ah, it's not that impressive."
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   People weren't, you know, were waving back and not seeing their replies.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   They weren't getting email notifications.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   This, you know, the way that buzz kind of just landed in your Gmail inbox and was this giant
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   add-on and made all this noise, you know, Google plus isn't this single monolith that was like
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   wave, but it's not this, you know, invasive add-on either.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   It's this separate suite of products that you, that you can opt into.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   It's plus, it's extra.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   And, you know, it just, it feels like they just, there's a lot of thought that went into it.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   And, you know, no one wants to make lists of friends, not even me.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   I'm the organizer.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   I get a lot of satisfaction from organizing.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   No one wants to make lists of friends, but the fact that Google was able to let go of its focus on
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.200]   speed and efficiency and let Andy do his, do what he does best in that, that circle interface,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   that chip interface, dragging and dropping people onto a circle.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   It is so sweet.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   The leading a circle is just so delightful and neat you want, or see, this is the thing.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   Time machine does this well too.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   Like, no one wants to back up your data, right?
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   But time machine is really cool.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   It makes it fun.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.960]   I think circles makes, you know, an organizational task, which is kind of a pain really easy.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:16.560]   And what I also like about this is that upfront, when you're sharing, you have to say, who am
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.560]   I sharing this with?
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.960]   Which circles am I sharing this with?
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.120]   Now, I believe that Facebook, you can make lists in Facebook.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.200]   I'm not even sure if you can share selectively with lists.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.720]   You can have a group.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   In groups you can.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.200]   You can have a group, but it's not.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.240]   It's sort of, you have to really know the product well and it's sort of buried.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.960]   This is what I like, really like about circles.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.360]   But upfront and center, you're saying, I'm showing this to my mom and my brother, or
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.080]   I'm showing this to Jeff and Leo, and I really dig that.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.320]   So I like that Google, I think it shows a lot of evolution.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.400]   This is the iteration three, I think, of their major social apps.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.600]   It doesn't look like a GWT, you know, the Google Web Toolkit design, you know, doesn't
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.640]   have the Google Voice, Google Wave, email time.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   This is gorgeous.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640]   I mean, it's beautiful.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.600]   It looks really nice.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.880]   And I too am trying to be cautiously optimistic.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.800]   The reality is that social products are only as useful as how many of your friends are in
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   it, right?
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.200]   So this remains to be seen what adoption is going to be like, right?
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.920]   But I mean, just hang out alone for me.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.240]   Just a couple weeks ago, I was thinking, I hate being alone in my office all day.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.000]   I'm going to find a co-working space.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.040]   I need to see more humans.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.480]   Hang out, that'll be something I'll have on all the time.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.640]   And for my coworkers at Expert Labs and my former Life Hacker co-…
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.160]   I mean, I'll be able to see my friends talking more and talk with them face to face a lot
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   more.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160]   And in fact, I think it was interesting.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.760]   Last night, Jeff and Vic and Bradley and I were in a hangout.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.000]   And that's actually the first time I've ever had a chance to talk to Vic directly.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.480]   I've seen him at conferences and I've always been too intimidated and too scared to walk
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.480]   up to him.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.760]   But then suddenly, Google hangout, I was talking directly with Vic.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.240]   I was a little intimidated.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.560]   But Jeff asked Vic and Bradley to be on Swig today in Hangout.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.200]   And there's something, there's a social pressure about being asked something face to
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   face in front of nine other people.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.400]   And they both kind of paused because they're both busy.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.280]   They paused for a moment and then they just said, "Oh, okay."
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.080]   You know, like you can tell that if we had sent them an email, they may not.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.120]   They may be because I know you're around.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   No, it could have been hard for the year.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.000]   Plus Gina, I also looked at you because I was making it a executive decision year.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.360]   Not sure whether this was the right thing to do for the show.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   Is that okay?
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:32.320]   And so the human cues and signals each got all around became really interesting.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.960]   It was a really, really interesting moment.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.360]   I was thrilled that you asked because I didn't have the guts to ask.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.600]   I was like, "Of course, this is what a real journalist does, right?"
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   I was like, "Oh my God, it's Vic."
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   I was like, "I'm a star of the book."
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   You've been a California two of all that.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   I guess so.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   I guess so.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   Hey, you're going to join us or what?
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   Get in here.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   Hey, get in here.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   I should do my book tonight.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:59.200]   I talked to Tim Shea, who's the head of next-to-network, which was brought by Google.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.400]   And he said, "I said, "I said, "I didn't think it, but you're still like it."
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.480]   I hadn't seen Tim in a year and a half.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.520]   So I got to reconnect with him, which is part of the magic.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.880]   Plus remember of Facebook and Twitter, too, is you reconnect.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.200]   And so I talked to Tim and he was talking about this and he said that even though I'm
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.600]   seeing this as very social, he said he hasn't had a phone call with anyone since he's been
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.840]   at Google.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   All he's done is hang out.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   Interesting.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   Everything is this.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.040]   And that's how he could have all communication that he's had.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.320]   It's just nobody wants to call.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.240]   I find this very exciting to be.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   It is.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.200]   Thinking of things, Tim was at food camp as was Bradley Horowitz, as was Gina.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.880]   And Gina, one of the things that struck me is that you can have little mini food camps.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.480]   One of the great things is seeing people in real life, the ability to do these hangouts
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.280]   and see these people, we could even play werewolf in here.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.200]   I see Dylan Fields in here.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.960]   We could even play werewolf in here.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.040]   I mean, it would be, this is, I don't know how we'd do it, but we'll have to, they need
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   a werewolf button.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.440]   You have to have a private I am conversation going on with the.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.440]   So are you?
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.120]   Matt, Dylan and Arin, by the way.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.680]   So I just think this is really intriguing.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.720]   And boy, you can re and scobles not.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   You can really.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.800]   You can really see the design, the UI put into this.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.640]   I think it's, that's kind of boy.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.680]   I don't know if it's all Andy, but this is unique.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.040]   Look, here's a cat.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   What is that?
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.000]   Well, we all's got an animal of some sort.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   He's holding up.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   I think there's marketing.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.520]   There's no ads visible now, not yet.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.680]   My editor, Simon and Schuster, when he saw this said, oh, can we do a book party on
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.560]   plus for, I don't know, a certain book coming out September 27th, Simon and Schuster called
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   public parks.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.040]   And pre-order is available now on Amazon.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   Yes.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.960]   And so, can you, can you imagine getting together with new kinds of focus groups, imagine customer
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.160]   service here.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.040]   I'm starting to huddle up people running problems with my computer.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.320]   You know, you just start to start to, this is where I always go too far.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:07.280]   But what other kinds of communication besides just hanging out, make this possible?
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   Because I think, Gina, you really hit on something there.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.880]   Sick, conductors boxes, the same size as Gina, Japan, these boxes.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   Yes.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.080]   There's an equalization there.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.840]   There's no stage here.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   Everyone gets the stage when they say something and they don't get interrupted.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.320]   And that's really cool.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.000]   It's pretty darn interesting.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.400]   Yeah, hangouts.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.680]   They definitely, they did great with hangouts.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.480]   The stream is not that different than Facebook or Buzz.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   It feels like friend feed.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   It feels like Buzz.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.240]   It feels better than Facebook.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:47.720]   But it's irritating because any, it defaults to giving you any post with recent activity.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:54.480]   So Vix post last night that said, wow, congratulations team, as all of his employees sucked up to
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.800]   them and said, yeah, thanks, boss.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.400]   It pumped that up to the top of my feed constantly.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   That was a buzz problem.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.040]   That was a big buzz problem.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.640]   They didn't learn that one from Buzz.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.960]   And I want more options to decide what it is.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.800]   I thought incoming was just new posts.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.400]   And then somebody from Google said, no, it's not.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.440]   It's kind of people who I'm not following.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   I want a few more controls there, not defaults, but just let me see just new posts.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.120]   Let me see current activity.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.720]   Let me see stuff you recommend.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.880]   Make that very clear to me.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.440]   The names, as Gina said last night, are really nice and human and cute.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.680]   But sometimes they need a little clarity, I think.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   All right.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.600]   Well, let's keep nitpicking, understanding that this is nitpicking.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   What else is wrong?
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.240]   Well, I think the main thing is siloing, which is not necessarily their fault.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.840]   But how is this going to connect to Twitter?
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.200]   How can it connect to Facebook?
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.080]   I want to be able to post one thing.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.040]   I mean, I was feeling a little bit of an anc API question.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.680]   If they provide an open API and access to the fire hose, there's nothing to stop Twitter
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.920]   from federating with this, right?
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   Which should be fine.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   Right, she does.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.320]   I mean, I think that that's the key.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   So that's the question.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.720]   And that's why it's an important question.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:08.000]   I didn't mention this to Vic, but that came from Lou and our chat room who works at Microsoft.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.120]   So I think that there's genuine interest in this.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.960]   And you know, if they do the AP, why wouldn't they do it?
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.960]   Right.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.920]   Because unlike Facebook, unlike Twitter, they're not trying to silo.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.640]   It's in Google's interest to get all of these companies to federate.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.880]   Is it not?
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.040]   Is it an actress?
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   They want to drive traffic.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.040]   Isn't that all they care about?
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.000]   It's I mean, it's in their interest to get users.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   They really want to get users.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.600]   And this is, I have to say, I'm really glad that the focus is on users first and then
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   developers.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.800]   I mean, I'm certainly interested in the API and I'm dying to integrate this and think
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.520]   up and all those great things.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.600]   But you know, I think there's something about, we don't want another buzz or another friend
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.920]   feed where people just sort of pipe their Twitter posts and Twitter or their friend
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   feed posts.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:52.120]   We want, you know, they Google wants people to be interacting on Google+, because it
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   forms a different--
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.560]   Well, that's the difference between buzz and plus.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.520]   In buzz, buzz became just another Twitter.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   Everybody who's pumping their Twitter into it.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.040]   We're not proposing that.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.440]   We're not saying that Google should suck it from Twitter.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.600]   We're saying Twitter should suck it from Google.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   That's a big difference, especially from Google's point of view.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.160]   In fact, it might be the reason the Twitter doesn't do it.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.800]   They don't want to become an also ran.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.120]   But I want to pump out to Twitter and let people know.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:21.280]   In fact, that was what's happening when Tim or no, when somebody else put up a hangout,
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.040]   they put it all on Twitter.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.680]   Publishing hangout on Twitter.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.680]   Bad idea.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.640]   Well, but you only get 10 people.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   That's true.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.080]   But you get the first 10 to see it.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.960]   You get the first 10, but if you're live, you're really lonely.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.280]   And you only get in with the URL.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.280]   Right.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.320]   Part of what I don't understand here is that there's two things that I haven't got my
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   head around yet.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.640]   More than that, but I'll list two now.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.000]   One is that this is async.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   This is not Facebook.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   It's async like Twitter in that I can follow people.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.520]   They don't have to follow me.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.200]   But I don't understand all the implications of that.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.600]   If I follow Robert Scobull and Robert Scobull doesn't follow me, does he see what I say?
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   I don't see what he says.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.760]   I don't understand that.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:08.800]   Second is when I make something public, what does public mean as opposed to just one of
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   my circles?
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   Right.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.840]   When it says public, how does the world see that?
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.160]   Does this have the potential to be Twitter and that I can follow lots of people who want
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.320]   to talk to the world?
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.200]   And where do I find that and how does that work?
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.680]   Of course, I can't yet because it's a closed test.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.000]   But those are the two things that are really confusing me so far about Plus.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.760]   Danny Sullivan just did a post.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:39.720]   I don't have the URL on me, but about how public Plus posts show up in search results.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.080]   So right now I think that you can search.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:47.880]   You can use the site colon plus.google.com advanced operator and search for Jarvis.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.880]   Let's see.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.880]   And then, yeah.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.280]   So I'm getting post by Jeff Jarvis in Google Plus.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.440]   So Google Plus public posts will show up in search results.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.600]   And I'm sure that they'll show up even more once we're out of the field.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   In this case, I want them to show up on Twitter too.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.040]   And I actually do want them to show up on Facebook too.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.040]   Facebook probably won't allow it.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.320]   But Facebook lets Twitter in.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.000]   Why wouldn't they let this in?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Right.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   So I want that end of it.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Right?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.360]   What was the other thing I was confused about?
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.440]   I'm looking at Danny's post here.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.360]   Anything that happens with Google Plus can be made public with the world if someone chooses
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   to do so.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.760]   And I've got a scoble declared he'd friended over a thousand people.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.080]   He made that public and you can see it says public.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   Of course.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.080]   Right there.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.280]   Of course, everything Robert does is public.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:37.320]   And then presumably Google does, you know, do a good job of spidering Google.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.080]   Oh, I know what I was asking.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.840]   The asynchronous nature of that.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   Okay.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:49.000]   So, so Leo, if you and I put Robert in our circles, we will see what Robert says to the
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.200]   public world, but we will not see what he says to a circle of neighbors.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   Right.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   I don't know.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   I mean, let me let's ask Robert.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   He's in here right now.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   He in a circle.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   Robert doesn't mean go ahead, Robert.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.720]   Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:12.640]   If I share an item with just my family and don't put it to the public feed, you won't
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.640]   see it.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.560]   Well, that's as it should be.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   Right.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.760]   Go to the next level, Robert.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.400]   So if I follow you, I will see anything public you say, but you will not see any public I
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.000]   say unless you follow me.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Right.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Okay.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.680]   So it's a it's it's it's a refine.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   It's Twitter with circle.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.560]   That I'm not sure about probably true.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.960]   So what happens is it's if you take a French regiment to send us, let's say I'm following
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   that cuts.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.520]   So.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.200]   And that cuts is a friend of yours and that cuts is following you and you share something
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.160]   and he plus ones that does it put it in my view, I believe it does.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.800]   Oh, Matt.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   Is Matt in there anymore?
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   Yeah, he's he's right there.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.800]   Yeah, man.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   Go ahead.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   Speak speak to us, Matt.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   This is so cool.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   I'm going to use this from now on on all the shows.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   Ten of you will get to talk.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   Hey, Matt.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.000]   Hey, Leo, Leo, this is your video.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   What we've got stuff?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   This is freaking cool.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.800]   This is exactly what we talked about last week.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.320]   We've been playing with all the corner cases and you can mute people and you can chat.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   It's really pretty nice.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.920]   I'm going to try to compose myself and be a journalist here, but it's kind of hard
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   not to jump up and down.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.800]   So, Leo, I'm going to leave this running on one of my machines 24 hours a day and people
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   can just see if I'm there or not.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   I am too.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   Actually hang out.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.200]   It's automatically shut down after a few hours.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   Oh, is it?
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.000]   So, will tell us who you are, Will Norris.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   So we.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.240]   So, I'm a developer advocate or developer programs engineer at Google working on the
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.600]   Google+ platform.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   So, he knows in other words.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.680]   Can you explain this async too heavy?
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.720]   That means we don't get to watch Robert on that bed in the middle of the night.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.600]   That's Gary Kay, by the way, the deep voice coming from a studio.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   Doug Kay.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   Doug Kay.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   Doug Kay.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   I'm Doug Kay.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   Gary Kay is an old friend.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   Doug Kay.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   Thank you.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   So, it's so matter, Will, am I right that if your friends of, let's say, Leo's and Leo's
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:15.640]   share something in the public, I don't see it, but if you plus want it, as it put in
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.160]   in my view, because I'm calling you.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   That's a good question.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   I'm not 100% sure.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   That's very buzzy.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   That's very buzzy.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.640]   I don't believe that simply plus one in it will span and do that.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.640]   Oh dear.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   And this is the problem of.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.480]   I'm just going to mute that.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.800]   We were for a while it was working nicely because I think, Robert, help me.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.520]   Did I have, do I need to mute everybody and unmute people as we speak to them?
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   How is this going to work?
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.440]   No, somebody needs to meet themselves or we need to figure out who's noisy and we'll
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.440]   meet them.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.640]   Yeah, so I do have, I see I have these granular mute controls.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   So I can remember.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.480]   The problem, Leo, the problem was that somebody was watching your video stream and have
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.880]   stopped speaker at their mic open.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   Right.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.880]   Just watch it.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   You can't do that unfortunately, which is a little bit of a limitation.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.920]   I guess you could do it if you were headphones or something.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.720]   Yeah, that's why that's why I'm wearing headphones and I have a good mic.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   Right.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   And then there's.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.280]   Yeah, otherwise, like we can't hear Jeff in the Hangout.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.280]   You can't.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   You wouldn't want that.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   Well, I can make that.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   That would be a bad thing.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.160]   We can make it so you hear Jeff now.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:26.720]   Yeah, if you feed Jeff and Tina, Jeff and Gina into the, into the Google plus audio,
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.720]   then we'll all hear that too.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.200]   I am doing that now.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   And then it's utopia.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   Well, only if you get.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.280]   We'll just die and go to heaven.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:40.880]   So Leo, we were talking last week about having a wall of screens where you have twit listeners
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.080]   able to come in and join and talk.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.480]   Google has been for you.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.240]   Yeah, this is really good.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   This is fascinating.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.280]   Yeah, there's so much I can do with this.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.320]   But it's not, it's not specifically me because really this, yes, there's a broadcast value
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   to it.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:03.760]   But what it really does is it solves it's, it's, it's a social thing that works socially.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.080]   And in intriguing ways, you know, this, one of the things that strikes me is that a company
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:14.320]   like Google has so much clout and these products have such widespread use potential.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.280]   You know, this could literally be used by a billion people that it can change society.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.200]   Oh, here you go.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.040]   Well, don't you think?
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   I know.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.040]   That's what I always do.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   I'm trying my best not to do that.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.440]   I would have said, I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.740]   I'm really interested in like kind of the cultural like behavioral effects that, that
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.740]   these kinds of things have.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.760]   Like, I really like Vix analogy about the someone hanging out on a porch.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.080]   The thing about a hangout though is that it's a moving porch because there is no host or
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   owner.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.320]   You know, it just sort of lives as long as there's someone in it, it lives.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.400]   And so Andy and my co-worker Andy and I were hanging out today and we were talking about,
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.480]   you know, what are the kind of social conventions around popping into a hangout and leaving a
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   hangout.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   Do you say goodbye?
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.380]   Can you pop in and really not say anything and just lurk like you can and I or see?
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.300]   And so last night, Jeff and I were on a hangout and a Googler who I won't name was saying
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.560]   that one thing that's been happening internally at Google is that, you know, hangouts have
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.120]   been sort of happening all through the night and there are these kind of young Googlers
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.360]   and interns using it.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.920]   And so eventually someone says something flirtatious or there's some sexual innuendo.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.360]   And so that the new thing that people do is they show their hands when that happens.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.640]   Oh, I like that.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.400]   So already we've got a new cultural like somebody, somebody says something dirty, you show your
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   hands.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.860]   I think that's, that is really interesting to me.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.220]   You know, what are, what are the conventions?
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.820]   Am I going to, am I going to leave this on and with my co-workers, the hangout and just
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.180]   sort of walking it out of my office?
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.580]   Look at, they're all showing their hands, Gina.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.540]   To hold guilty.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.540]   Hand check.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:51.460]   Which is, you know, it's kind of funny.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.380]   This solves this part of the week.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.020]   I held myself back and not using this word while the two are steamed guests for Google
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.900]   were on, but this solves the penis problem.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.740]   I almost said that and then I thought better of it.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.740]   I did too.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.740]   I stopped myself.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.240]   But, but it's, you know, it is the chat roulette is that identity is the interesting.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.960]   It's just enough identity.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.440]   You know, people, somebody well enough.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.720]   It gives you enough control to mute them.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.320]   It really becomes far more proper resource.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.360]   There can be anonymous people in here, but they're friends of friends.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.720]   So for instance, I started this hangout.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.840]   I don't know many of the people in here because Robert then added a bunch of people.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.840]   Right, Robert?
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   So that, that, yeah.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   What is that symbol?
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.840]   What is that symbol?
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:38.100]   That's, that's the way that wave.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.180]   It's starting to, I have to say this is starting to feel a little bit too much like the Gilmore
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180]   gang.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.180]   Oh, oh.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.180]   That's really getting low.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:54.260]   It has a, well, in some ways though, I say that in a positive way, but it has the value
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:55.820]   of the Gilmore gang.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.900]   We in somewhat more controlled situation plus video.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.900]   I mean, I think this is very intriguing.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:04.520]   I mean, one of the things I like about the Gilmore gang is the, is the large group and
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.080]   the somewhat anonymous ability to add people.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.180]   But Robert, these, all these people are your friends.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.180]   So they're friends of friends.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.180]   Now can they then add somebody?
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.700]   And I wouldn't call them friends.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.420]   They're people I found on the, on the street corner.
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.260]   So you have the penis problem and then you have the scoble problem.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.180]   It's another problem entirely.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.180]   We need a new sign.
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.860]   In my first four hours, I've found 1,200 people on Google.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.860]   I know.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:27.860]   I can't believe you did.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.220]   We need a new sign for Robert.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.220]   This is the Robert sign.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.780]   It's an S scoble problem.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.220]   No, but, but this is friends of friends.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.540]   So it's not completely anonymous.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:42.660]   And if somebody does do something untoward in here, they are, they are, in somebody on
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.540]   here's a circle.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.100]   Nobody's disconnected.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.340]   And you can report them.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.780]   There's a red hand underneath everybody's picture and you can report them to Google and
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.780]   say this, this person's naughty.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.020]   Oh, that's a naughty hand.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.020]   I see it.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.020]   That's a naughty hand.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.540]   The couple was on last night.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.980]   If I got into a fight with Robert and I wanted to just knock him out because I want to talk
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.820]   to everybody else and he wanted to knock me out and still talk to everybody else.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.700]   That's again an asynchronous thing.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.100]   We didn't want to do it and actually report somebody.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.820]   We were trying to figure out last night what are the rules that's built into the software
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.820]   around that.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.380]   Matt, do you know?
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.380]   Matt cuts.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.380]   I don't know.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.020]   Matt, do you know that?
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.020]   Matt's trying to do it.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.020]   Matt's trying to work.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.020]   He was making a sign.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.020]   Put the link.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.020]   Put it in here.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.020]   Get backwards.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.020]   No.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.020]   No.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:39.020]   I just asked the chat room where they were jealous of the hangout and I think they are.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.020]   Well, we'll use this.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.020]   I'll tell you what.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:46.620]   We will use this on Twitter like crazy.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.420]   My mind is reeling with the possibilities here.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.540]   One thing that always kind of made me sad, I wanted to use, as you know, Friend Feed.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:47:00.380]   I wanted to use Buzz and they just didn't take off and I ended up back at Twitter and
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.660]   I've never been fully happy with Twitter.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:08.380]   I keep hoping somebody will come up with the next thing and in some respects, is it too
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.020]   soon to say feels a little bit like that?
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:17.780]   I'm not sure it goes that far and I'm not looking at it that way.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   It's fun.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.780]   This is something that Google hangout is something you can't do with Twitter.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   Right.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.100]   Or Facebook, I might add.
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.100]   How big a threat to Facebook is this?
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:33.780]   Is Mark Zuckerberg quivering in his Adidas shower?
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:42.020]   Oh, Malek wrote today that Facebook shouldn't be worried.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:46.060]   The problem is I think we have to ask why Google is doing this.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.620]   And part of what I believe and part of what I think Omens said, if I remember it was his,
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.740]   is that this is a lot about search.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.700]   I have been arguing that the war now is over the best signal generation.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.300]   How do companies entice us to generate signals about ourselves so that they can better give
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:06.020]   us relevance and targeting in content services and advertising?
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.060]   And Google finally admitted and realized that they didn't have our lives.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.740]   They didn't have us as people.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.540]   They had us as words and questions, but they didn't have us as people and they have to
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.100]   learn more about us.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:21.220]   So there's going to be the fight that says, oh, Facebook has, you know, 600, whatever
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.060]   million number of people, 100 million people it has now.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.900]   And Google will have pick a number, 100 billion.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.940]   They say, ah, Google lost.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.020]   That's not going to be the calculation.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.020]   The calculation is going to be how we use Google, how we think of Google, how Google
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.220]   can serve us better, how Google learns more going forward.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:44.060]   And so, you know, what is, I think what I would ask instead of Facebook is not a numbers
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   game.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:49.820]   And Facebook is going to look and they better have this video feature fast or something
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.820]   equally as cool.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.420]   But I think that, you know, I actually think that one of the very interesting things about
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.620]   about this is sparks.
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.420]   I went through and found stuff about newspapers and journalism and the odd wonky things that
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.460]   I want to know and did immediately add them to conversation.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:11.020]   People did immediately pass them around and it added more substance than, hey, I got
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:15.380]   drunk last night, which is what has been interpreted as social.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.300]   So it adds, try this on.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.180]   It adds substance to social.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:24.740]   So I think Zuckerberg has to say, how does he add new functionality that they have here?
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:29.260]   How does he add substance to social and give us more control?
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:34.580]   I think that the whole notion of being able to create circles, Facebook might well have
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.580]   done it too.
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:39.420]   But the difference for Google is simply that it started from day one.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.580]   Let's see, I have a thousand friends in Facebook.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:44.900]   You were never ever, ever going to organize them.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:48.860]   So along with it answer with absolutely no conclusion, I don't think Facebook is necessarily
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:49.860]   scared.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.540]   I don't think that the war here is going to be over raw numbers.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:57.340]   I think we're going to see some really interesting competition about features and I think it's
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:02.500]   going to be really good for both of them, include and Twitter and Twitter clients and
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.580]   four square and so on.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.580]   So it's interesting.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.380]   I just played with sparks in that way.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.420]   I picked an article and I shared it.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.540]   When you share it, you actually, this is really kind of intriguing.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.980]   You have a choice of sharing it with your existing circles, adding a circle, extending
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.580]   a circle or public.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.340]   And you can do several at the same time.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:30.100]   So I can add public and then and say, oh, and by the way, send it to my family too.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.580]   And email for people not using Google+.
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:37.340]   So this is a very granular, very kind of, I think powerful sharing system.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.340]   So I agree with you.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.940]   Sparks is maybe a dark horse here that has some interesting potential.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.460]   Certainly, I guess it's the conversation starter.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.460]   Is that it?
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.020]   That seems to be what the name kind of sparks a conversation.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.180]   So Gina, we're all being cautious here.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.700]   We're all being Leo started off the edge.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.700]   We pulled him back.
[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:02.700]   Thank you.
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:03.700]   So close.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:04.700]   I would have lost.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.700]   And I'm there too.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:10.060]   Because Gina, you saw the potential in Wave.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:18.020]   Is this less profound and slicker or is this as profound as Wave could have been?
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:24.020]   Wave was trying to solve problems that people who are mailing lists and use wikis have,
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.020]   right?
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.580]   And that's a kind of a small group, I think, of super power internet users.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:37.180]   I think that plus one is really trying to hit mainstream folks who are frustrated with
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.860]   Facebook, who want something better than Facebook.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.820]   Have you seen the XKCD?
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.620]   A cartoon about Google+, you know, plus it was, you know, somebody says, "You should
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.140]   try Google+ and what is it?
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.140]   It's not Facebook.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.140]   What's it like?
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.140]   Facebook."
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.300]   And it's like, "Oh yeah, that's exactly what I wanted."
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.940]   I want something just like Facebook that isn't Facebook.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.060]   Right, just like Facebook that isn't Facebook.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:04.620]   So I think that Wave and plus are trying to solve different problems.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.940]   I mean, there's the broad stroke problem of like collaboration.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.340]   I mean, Wave was more about collaboration, collaborating on documents.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.100]   Plus seems more about connecting people.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.900]   I'm kind of obsessed with Hangouts, which is this, you know, feels like a very strong,
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.420]   strong connection.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:21.180]   But Huddle is something that I'm really looking forward to.
[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.700]   My lunch buddies, I can't wait till you get out.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.700]   What's Huddle?
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.700]   Oh, that's the group messaging.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.700]   The group messaging.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.460]   What's available now or is that something I have to wait for?
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.620]   It's available now in the Android app only.
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.740]   And it will be in the iOS app and it will also integrate with regular SMS.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.940]   So it'll be easy to just set up a lunch buddy circle and say, "Hey, where do you want to
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:38.940]   meet today?"
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.140]   So let's put it this way.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:45.940]   Plus is trying to tackle a much less geeky problem than Wave was.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.940]   Right.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.940]   So here's the interface.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.940]   Here's the Huddle.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:49.940]   Right, there's the interface.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.940]   Tap on Huddle.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:54.420]   Actually, I think Jason Howell has already created one.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.180]   So I see this message.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.980]   It came in as actually what looked like a text message, but it had the Google+ notification
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.220]   sign next to it.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.060]   Why isn't it on the web?
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.060]   Interface.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.060]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.060]   It's not on the mobile web interface.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.140]   I mean, I think it's supposed to really, they're kind of positioning it as group text
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.140]   messaging.
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.540]   And yeah, it's only available.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.140]   In fact, I'm definitely getting the feeling from iOS folks that they're feeling a little
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.540]   bit left out or not being able to try Huddle because it's an Android only app.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.740]   And can we add a video to this?
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.740]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:24.740]   Oh, interesting.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   Very interesting.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.740]   Watch out FaceTime.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:32.300]   I have to tell you, this show is the reason why I got so excited about Hangout is because
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:36.940]   I just feel like video chat, group video chat is such an intimate kind of way to talk
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:37.940]   and meet with people.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:38.940]   Amen.
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.820]   And I was really shy about video chat before we started doing Twig.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.300]   And then when I saw Hangout, I was like, yes, exactly.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.420]   I'm going to do my own Twig that isn't broadcast.
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:49.420]   And this is an important thing.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:54.940]   The fact you can't record a Hangout or unless you're using screen recording software, it
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.220]   lets you talk about people who came in and left.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:02.660]   When you go into a Hangout, there's also a text chat on the left side.
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:06.460]   If you come into a Hangout, you do not see what people said before you came in, which
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.460]   is interesting.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.380]   It's a very ephemeral, just a conversation at a cocktail party.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.380]   If you're there, you're there.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.060]   And if you're not, you miss it kind of thing.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.140]   And I really like that.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.140]   This isn't about productivity.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.140]   It's not about journalism.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.340]   It's not about broadcasting.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.260]   It's about just hanging out.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.820]   And I dig that a lot.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.620]   I just figured out how you could play werewolf with it too.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.860]   All right, everybody put your head down.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:36.140]   Now, werewolves, wake up and see, they'll look up.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.140]   You got to trust everybody.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.180]   Yes, see, look, see this.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.500]   I know you were a werewolf.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.580]   This is really interesting.
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.780]   So Leo, take what you just said.
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.380]   There's the awake check, by the way.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.140]   Since I haven't done anything, it says, are you still here?
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.140]   And I have to say yes.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:54.140]   OK, so--
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.140]   Like a dead man switch.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:56.140]   Yeah, dead man switch.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:57.140]   But I don't know that was an hour in, I think.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.140]   Yes, exactly an hour in.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:02.580]   So one thing you could do here is I could imagine the Twit Network deciding that you
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.980]   could have a mini sub show.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:05.980]   Right.
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.980]   Right.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:11.540]   You could just have a Samsung tablet people pick their own 10 people.
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:15.860]   And because they can't broadcast to the world through Twit, you could.
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.860]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.860]   Right.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:23.620]   So it extends this into a public form.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.700]   You can do that.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.980]   You can make a hangout public.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:32.740]   I should probably get-- I should have asked Vic, but I guess it's-- he kind of by his
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.340]   silence gave me permission.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.260]   I wonder if there is in the license agreement something that prevents me from doing what
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.380]   I'm doing right now, which is re-broadcasting this.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.380]   I don't--
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.380]   Surely not.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.380]   It's how could--
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:47.580]   Well, everybody-- I'd probably have to put a message up that says everybody, by the way,
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.580]   you're on the air.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.580]   Oh, that part.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.580]   But that's not a licensing issue.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.620]   No, that's not a Google licensing issue.
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:58.300]   Seth is showing us his tablet version of this.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.820]   Is that huddle in tablet form, Seth?
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.820]   Speak so that we can hear you on.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:03.820]   Speak so we can see you.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.820]   You can click on Seth.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.820]   What do I click on if I just double click on him?
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   Click him on him.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.820]   Click him on him.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.820]   It makes him the main one.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.820]   There you go, Seth.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:11.820]   Show us the tablet again.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:12.820]   I don't hear you.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.820]   Oh, because I muted you.
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:14.820]   Foolish me.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.820]   Go ahead, Seth.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:20.620]   Seth, I was actually showing you Robert's, I guess, message post.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.900]   What is the unit of a shared thing?
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:25.260]   You get to name it, Seth.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.260]   Congratulations.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.260]   Monad.
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.260]   It's a Monad.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.260]   Let's call it a Leo.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.260]   It's called a Monad.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.260]   A Monad's good.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.260]   I like that.
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.260]   Very Kantian.
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:45.500]   So, Zeke Weeks and Twitter just said that however, we might solve the penis problem for
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.620]   chat or we're left, but not for politicians.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:51.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:53.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:54.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:02.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.180]   Just think of what representative Wiener could do.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:08.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.020]   This is fun.
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.460]   This is really, I could see getting a lot of work not done.
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.460]   Yes.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.460]   That's the same.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.060]   I just wanted to go into a hangout.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.060]   It really is.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.580]   Well, the other problem I have is I feel like I'm living in the middle of Mississippi
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.060]   now because I'm looking at my Twitter stream.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.860]   I'm looking at my plus stream.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.340]   I'm looking at my Facebook stream, not to mention my freaking email.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.340]   A little bit of RSS.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.340]   Remember that?
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.900]   You know, it's just life.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.700]   Everything has become profoundly afloat.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.500]   And I talk about process versus product all the time.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.900]   So what does that have to do with Mississippi?
[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:42.900]   I'm sorry, I missed the analysis.
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:43.900]   It's all stream.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.900]   It's a huge stream.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:45.900]   It's a huge stream.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:46.900]   It's like you're living in a river.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:47.900]   It's like, yeah.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:48.900]   It's all stream.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.900]   It's a huge stream.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.900]   It's like you're living in a river.
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:52.900]   Sorry, but that wouldn't have worked very well.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.900]   Yeah, OK.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:54.900]   The money, money in Mississippi.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.900]   I get it now.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:56.900]   I understand what you're saying.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:01.900]   River, just old man Twitter.
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.260]   Oh boy, you guys should just do your own hangout.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.260]   We're going to, yeah, no kidding.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.260]   We should have an old man hangout.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.940]   Get a hangout.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.020]   I can empty the hangout, yeah.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.140]   Hangouts for singers.
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.140]   Oh, karaoke.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.140]   Oh boy.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:17.140]   Oh boy.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:18.140]   Oh boy.
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:19.140]   Oh boy.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.140]   Oh, come on.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.540]   Let's get the hangout room to all sing one song.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.340]   Let's see if we can do it right now.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.340]   The first karaoke hangout.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.060]   It's not going to work so well because there's some latency.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.580]   So what song are they going to sing, Jeff?
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.900]   You get a picket.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:34.420]   The loudest singer will win.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.260]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.100]   Because we only hear one audio thing.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.100]   You only hear one at a time.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.100]   Oh, that's right.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.100]   OK, never mind.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.300]   I'm muting him again.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.100]   I don't want to hear it.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:45.420]   All right, let me get back to the philosophy.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:49.500]   Any good technology to succeed, to continue on, to be used,
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:51.060]   has to be generative.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.380]   Yes, it has to.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:56.220]   And we're seeing this already, in many ways,
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:00.580]   it creates new uses, creates new thoughts about how you might use it.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.900]   This is absolutely generative technology I would venture.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.540]   Is it as generative as Twitter was?
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.660]   Not yet.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.860]   Or could it be?
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.940]   So Twitter became generative to the extent
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:16.300]   that people could set standards and could act on them.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.820]   You could search on hashtags.
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:22.260]   I don't know that I see that yet here.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:26.780]   It'll be interesting to see how people try to extend this.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:27.140]   It will.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.380]   I mean, the hands up behavior is sort of the new retweet.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:35.180]   I guess a lot less useful, but kind of fun and private.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.980]   There's not a lot of search going on here.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.100]   I mean, this is viral in so much that if you share things in your stream,
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.660]   the fact that you've shared it will show up in my Google search results.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:48.980]   I mean, there are sort of subtle hooks into other places.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.820]   So I'm going to assume if I search for Android and Leo
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.500]   has posted something from his sparks, he shared something.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.740]   I'm going to see that in my search results.
[00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.940]   So there's some virility going on there.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.420]   This is very intriguing.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.860]   I think that what we're seeing is something
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.460]   brand new that has some huge potential.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:07.960]   Right.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.540]   Let me ask another way.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:13.300]   Gina is a developer, queen of the developers.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.980]   What would-- just knowing what you know so far.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.300]   Yeah, write something.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.420]   What would you write?
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.420]   What APIs would you want out of--
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:20.180]   what do you want?
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.460]   I just get your hands into.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.220]   Yeah, great question.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.220]   That is a really good question.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.100]   You mean you could write tweet up for this, yeah?
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.060]   Yeah, I would definitely want to integrate this with ThinkUp.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.820]   So pulling public posts and pulling posts that
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:35.020]   are revealed to the circles that I'm
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.500]   in doing the kind of sentiment analysis and conversational analysis
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.740]   that we're doing.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.700]   I mean, you don't need that as much here
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.620]   because this is the Reddit discussion.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.100]   So I can post a prompt or a question to my followers of people who
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.620]   know in their circles.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.860]   And I'll have that conversation in a particular view.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.180]   I definitely want to search through things
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.860]   that my friends have said, things
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.220]   that I have a circle called my inner circle, who
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.140]   are like my super trusted VIPs.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.020]   I would love to be able to search through just things
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.860]   that they've said about a particular topic.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:11.100]   Yeah, I'm really still kind of thinking about what else.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.620]   Now, what's interesting about this?
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.460]   Did you guys read Stephen Levy's Wired piece?
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.620]   I really recommend it kind of the background.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.220]   It's a long one.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.540]   It's like eight pages on the process of building Google+.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:23.100]   From what I understand, the four or five products
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.700]   that launched yesterday are just sort of the beginning.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.900]   And a lot of other things have launched previously.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.860]   Like, plus one was part of this.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.660]   It's going to be the Emerald Sea.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.180]   I guess that was the code name for their social effort.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.300]   So I'm interested to see what else they've got brewing
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.020]   and what else is going to come out.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.220]   Like, hang out.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.700]   Being able to watch a YouTube video together, that's cool.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.980]   I also want to be able to listen to music.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.380]   Like I said, like turntable.fm.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.860]   I want to be able to pair a program.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.820]   I want to be able to share a whiteboard, that kind of thing.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:55.660]   So this seems to lay the groundwork for that possibility.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.180]   Again, though, social stuff doesn't matter
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.580]   unless your friends are there.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.180]   So it'll be really interesting to see.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.860]   I'm going to tip Twitter really competed for my attention
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.460]   from Google, you know, from plus in the last day.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.380]   Is that going to continue?
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.660]   Or when I spend more on my time?
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:09.740]   It'll be interesting to see.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.700]   It feels more like a place you actively play in than--
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.380]   Yes.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.580]   A place that you--
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.340]   See, Twitter, I don't actively play.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.580]   And it's not as compelling in that.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.220]   Right.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.100]   Well, here's another way to put it.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.100]   I scraped Twitter.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:22.540]   I don't--
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:23.100]   Yes.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:23.100]   Yes.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:23.940]   I think you're right.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.820]   You're public.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.740]   This is where-- I don't know if I've said this in the show
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.580]   before, but when I took the son Jake with me
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.900]   to interview Zuckerberg, and on the way there,
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.020]   Jake said the wall wasn't something entirely new in society.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.140]   And Zuckerberg himself disagreed.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.660]   And of course, I went aside with Jake here.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.980]   Jake said, well, what happens there
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.860]   is people are having conversations in public.
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.380]   And that's what made me realize that I didn't look at it that way.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.940]   I see the Facebook wall and Twitter by reflex
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.740]   as a place to publish or broadcast.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.740]   I see it as media.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.580]   Right.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.660]   Jake doesn't see it that way.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.420]   Jake and his friends see it as truly as conversation.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:58.020]   It's the one who's cooler.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.100]   And you use things to feed that.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.580]   It's their one that is.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.300]   And it's their society.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.740]   And that's where they do this.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.780]   So two people will have what appears
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.220]   to be a private conversation, but in public.
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:08.860]   And that's new.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.300]   So my point is that I think plus is built more
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:17.860]   around that model of the water core than of the newspaper.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.220]   And Twitter, when I talked to Ev, Twitter,
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.340]   he really sees Twitter as a news and publishing tool.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.620]   And I think that's what it's built as.
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.860]   That's what it's turned into.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:33.300]   This is something in between the two where I can put in substance.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.180]   I can put in content.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.620]   I can do all those things.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:41.780]   But the reason to do it in plus is to socialize.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.580]   It is to be with people.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:44.940]   Right.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:44.940]   Right.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.620]   With certain people.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.660]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.180]   Twitter has the-- I mean, Twitter's privacy settings
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:49.740]   are binary.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.220]   You either protected or you're public.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.660]   And most people are public.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.180]   I thought the Facebook wall was based on the white board
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.140]   that college students put on their dorm,
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:01.620]   put on their residence hall door so people could write on.
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.340]   I mean, this just introduces multiple hallways.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.620]   I've got my twig hallway where you guys live.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.580]   And then I've got my family hallway
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:11.580]   where my mom and my brother live.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.940]   That's interesting.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.620]   And I think that this stress-- plus stresses the fact
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.340]   that people have multiple hallways.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.620]   I mean, I think when you have a social network like Facebook,
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.540]   built by someone in college whose most significant life
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:29.460]   experience is college, there's one hallway where you live.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.100]   Yeah, I think that's really right, Gina.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.980]   And I think that I've watched myself.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.660]   And of course, I'm Mr. Public.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.580]   But now that I have the chance with everything I post,
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.740]   with one of the buttons there, I'm
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.340]   making virtually everything public.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.020]   Because that's what I do.
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.100]   And I'm used to it from Twitter.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.660]   And I'm fine with that.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.180]   The reason that I make something public to a smaller group
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:54.260]   is not so much privacy, but to not annoy everybody else.
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.660]   So if I say something to the Twit group,
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.340]   it's probably not because we have super secrets,
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.180]   but it's because this is only relevant to you guys.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:02.700]   Right.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.300]   Well, I mean, I can imagine playing the show in my Twig circle.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:06.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.260]   Well, we imagine that in Wave 2.
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.140]   I hate to point that out.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.260]   Reality facts.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.580]   We imagined a lot of things.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:18.060]   I mean, when I first heard about Wave,
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.340]   actually, when I started using it,
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.700]   it was pretty apparent immediately
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.180]   that it wasn't going to be useful for what we wanted to do.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.820]   But when we first heard about it, I thought,
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.340]   this is exactly what we're looking for.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.180]   I said it was going to change all of journalism.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.300]   You know, I went way overboard.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:38.260]   But that notion of privacy doesn't become a negative.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.060]   It becomes a positive.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.660]   In the way you just put a genome.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.420]   I can choose to go down this hall and just shout to those people
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.380]   and not bother everybody else.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:46.980]   Right.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:54.380]   And so the privacy has an active benefit.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.300]   Say one thing I like.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:06:00.180]   Unlike Twitter, I can edit my GD posts.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.100]   Typo in here.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:01.860]   There we go.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:02.740]   That's better.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.780]   You can change history, Leo.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.460]   I don't know if I like that out.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.580]   This has-- this is very buzzy.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.340]   You know, I got to wonder what-- a wither buzz.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:11.820]   Oh.
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.860]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.580]   Here's my tweet on that.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.660]   Buzz was.
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:17.620]   Buzz was.
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.620]   Buzz was.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:20.900]   And we have a show title.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.140]   Did you spell it W-U-Z-Z or W-A-S?
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:26.780]   I like that.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   Buzz was.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.020]   Buzz was, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.220]   I think so.
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.220]   I think so.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.940]   There's a lot of potential for integration here, right?
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.900]   So I'd love to see this supersede buzz.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.460]   I would love to see more integration out
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:40.380]   to talk and to contacts and to SMS.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.820]   I would love to see Google Reader kind of integrate
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:45.540]   with sparks and the sharing and liking and favoriting
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.660]   and commenting there to also feed into this.
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.300]   I mean, Google has been throwing a lot of stuff
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.420]   up against the wall in different silos.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.860]   Tied into calendar?
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.340]   Yeah, tied into-- I mean, yeah, there's so much--
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.180]   You could schedule--
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.540]   Meaning it's a hangout.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.060]   Hangouts.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.780]   Think of all the people who are disenfrained.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.940]   Does hangout have whiteboard capability or--
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:05.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.300]   --screeching?
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.380]   Because if you're go to meeting, you're scared by this.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.820]   I mean, the potentials here are to be a real disruptor.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.780]   Huge.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.880]   Now, and Google's percentage in this
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.720]   is the same as it is with all other apps.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   Just the more you use it.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.680]   Because there's--
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.720]   Signals.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.600]   Because there's no ads.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.380]   We should have asked--
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.640]   I should have asked Vic.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.680]   I presume at some point there might be some ads.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.200]   But do they even need to put ads in here?
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.160]   Because you're right.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.120]   They're getting-- what they were missing was social search.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.760]   We've said this many times that they were going to get
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.080]   lapped by Facebook because Facebook could
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.840]   merge search with social.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.880]   Or Leo, look at it this way.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.080]   You know, you look at--
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.440]   Twitter is trying to figure out its ad model.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.360]   But at some point, brands are using it.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.880]   Best Buy is using it to have a relationship with people.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:00.280]   So I could imagine joining a Samsung hangout.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.560]   If I have a problem with my Samsung product,
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.520]   and the Samsung rep should go in there and say,
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.280]   well, let me explain that to you folks.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.800]   So the commercial value of plus may be highly relevant,
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:16.080]   highly voluntary, highly opt-in marketing relationships
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.200]   and customer service relationships.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.120]   Interesting.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.920]   I mean, Googlers are doing that right now.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.880]   And they're hopping and hanging out
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.720]   to explaining how to use the product now.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.640]   I mean, they're really setting an example
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.240]   for how to do good customer service and connection.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.920]   I mean, there's no better connection than seeing
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.200]   someone's face and hearing their voice.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.280]   Whoa, whoa.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.640]   Did that automatically tag it or did you tag it?
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.440]   It didn't tag me, but then you tagged it tag it.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.960]   OK, so I'm sorry.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960]   It didn't mean to say anything.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:44.600]   But there's face recognition tagging in this.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:44.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.480]   And in photos, right?
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.360]   It says, "Ecogy, do you need to tag folks?"
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.760]   Yeah, because this is the photo I just posted.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.040]   So they put up the facial recognition?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:53.560]   Oh.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.280]   Well, I don't know.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.080]   Is it facial?
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:55.640]   OK, no.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   So Gina, you're not named.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.400]   So I guess it's by hand.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.040]   It's not just me.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.600]   Anybody could do it.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.040]   It says click to name.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:03.560]   Click to name.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.400]   So let me name you.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:05.960]   This is interesting.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.200]   And then look at this.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.360]   On the right, the comment thread--
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.120]   by the way, I like this comment from Tyler Gillies.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.920]   Buzz was the day it came out.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.480]   Oh, we're going to incur the wrath.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.800]   Watch it.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.440]   OK, so I typed G and it found you in my circle.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.200]   And so now it's tagged.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.040]   Yeah, facial recognition is really easy to lay on.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.200]   Is it facial recognition?
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:30.880]   No.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.800]   No, but it's easy to layer on.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.720]   Photo details.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   Rotate left.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.240]   Rotate left.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.080]   This is the capabilities built into this.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.720]   By the way, this was not manually uploaded.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.320]   I took the picture.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.760]   I then went to my photos.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.040]   And I was able to look at it and share it.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.240]   And do things to it.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.360]   And share it immediately.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.000]   So this happened right after I took the picture.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.560]   You see, I turned off the option on my Android device
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.400]   to do automatic upload because I didn't--
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.880]   I don't understand it.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.360]   Now, of course, I turn it on.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.600]   I haven't turned it on because I feel a little skittish
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.080]   about it.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.760]   The wiener moment.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.320]   Leo, does that photo now have a public URL?
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.200]   Ah, interesting.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.360]   I don't know.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.600]   You know who might know?
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.240]   Let's ask Will in the--
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.360]   We used to ask the chat room.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.520]   But yeah, I'm not going to ask the chat or anything anymore.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.040]   Hey, Will.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.400]   Yeah, well, I was actually trying to tell you.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.240]   Yeah, I actually went in and tagged myself.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.840]   And I tagged Jeff pretty much as soon as you posted it.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.400]   So it's not doing automatic face recognition.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.080]   Good.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:30.920]   And I actually went in.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.720]   And is there a public URL for these pictures?
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.960]   I presume there is a permanent right?
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.120]   Well, if you posted the picture publicly,
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.160]   you should be able to--
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.880]   Yeah, if you-- the little arrow in the top right
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.440]   of your post--
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.720]   So public posts have--
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.520]   public anything as permalinks I would present.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:45.840]   Correct.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.440]   Well, actually, all posts have permalinks.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.200]   It's just that you can only actually see it
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.160]   if you have permission to see it.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.120]   So it says link to this post.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.520]   And see, now I have this link with a long goo.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.120]   UID, G-U-I-D.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.920]   All right, cool.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.920]   So that means this is--
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.280]   so should Flickr be worried?
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.480]   Oh, interesting, huh?
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.280]   Facebook has, I think, 10 times the number of photos
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.760]   the Flickr has.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.520]   Well, it's certainly--
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.080]   Easily.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.640]   You know, Picasso Web has been around for a long time.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.520]   But suddenly, Google's a big player.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.360]   This is the comment thread.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:21.920]   And--
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.720]   The automatic upload is really interesting, too.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.680]   Just the passive streaming from phones automatically.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.920]   That's Matt Sweeney speaking.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.760]   Matt--
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.960]   That's a totally different thing.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.360]   Matt, are you a Googler as well?
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.000]   No, no, just nearly invitee.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.920]   And early invitee, OK.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.800]   By the way, Leo, you have a green--
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.160]   you see the other green box around the person in the main screen.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.080]   He'll stay in the main screen until you click off the green box.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:46.520]   Got it.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.320]   So I get it.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.080]   So I've made Will permanent, but now he's nobody.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.320]   And--
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.760]   He thinks a lot, Leo.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.440]   That popped up briefly.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.040]   This is really interesting.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.680]   I love the chat that's going on as well in here.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.920]   You see these little bubbles pop up.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.600]   The facial recognition is pretty interesting, too.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.680]   There was an article a week ago where someone found reference
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.400]   to facial recognition in some of the early source--
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.160]   you know, the publicly viewable source code on like buzz
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.280]   or something like that.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.200]   So I wonder if it's one of these things where it's very--
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.080]   a very real capability, but that's not being surfaced
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   for sort of PR reasons in this first iteration.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.640]   We also have Sylvan Weber watching from Google Paris.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.040]   And Trey Radcliffe asks a question of you, Will,
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.520]   how can I share into my stream and existing photo
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.840]   in a Picasa album?
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.120]   Is there a yet cross-linking from Picasa?
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.400]   So when you first activate your account,
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.480]   you're given the choice to connect it to your Picasa account.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.280]   I don't know the details of exactly what that does,
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.160]   but when you go to the share box and click the photo icon,
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.120]   you should be able to select from an existing Picasa album.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.360]   OK.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.760]   I believe you can.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.000]   And I'll reiterate if you're just tuning in,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.760]   that Will Norris, who you're looking at right now,
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.640]   is one of the people on the team working on Google+.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.280]   Are all-- is the whole team will right now in Hangouts
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.920]   or on Google+ helping people interacting with users,
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.280]   that kind of thing?
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.320]   I don't know if the whole team is.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.440]   I would imagine quite a few people are, certainly.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.600]   I'm actually sitting here at home,
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.800]   so I'm not even going to be off this.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.760]   I just got a Twitter from Samsung Jessica,
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.760]   who likes the idea of using this for customer service
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.080]   and wants to try it out soon.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.040]   Yeah, Comcast cares.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.760]   It's just fascinating.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.920]   But now you can see the face of the person.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.880]   What does that do to the faceless corporation now has?
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.760]   You don't just have a name for the amount of voice.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.440]   You're going to look him in the eye.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.320]   That's really it.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.920]   That goes back to what Gina was saying about being there
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.600]   on the equal footing with Vic.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.320]   Yeah, so then asking him face to face to be on the show.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.840]   Oh, man.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.320]   You know, it goes back to my Dell hell.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.160]   When Dell bloggers came in and started dealing with people
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.440]   on their problems, people were just amazed, right?
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.600]   When Gina and I were in our little Hangout last night,
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.840]   and here comes Bradley and then Vic.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.920]   He just came back, by the way.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.680]   I think it's just--
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680]   Hey, Bradley.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.280]   Oh, there you are.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.800]   See, Bradley, I was just--
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.120]   you knew we were talking about you.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.880]   You had a system to tell you that, didn't you?
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.320]   We know.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.960]   Yeah, we need like the ears are burning feature now.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.520]   Forget face recognition.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.960]   They're talking about me recognition.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.760]   Well, we've got real time speech monitoring
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.040]   of all the Hangouts in place.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.200]   So any time that you're ready, Bradley, don't say it.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.000]   Don't even joke about that, man.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.400]   Don't even joke.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.360]   Isn't that right?
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:58.040]   Bradley Horowitz, VP of Google products, said--
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.000]   Now, wait a minute.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.320]   We're still on Twitter, aren't we?
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.920]   Yes.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.400]   You're in public, baby.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.480]   So hey, let me ask you--
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.360]   I forgot to ask you this.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.920]   Is there any restriction on rebroadcasting this Hangout,
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.400]   as I am doing right now?
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.960]   You know, you're a test case here.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.760]   I don't think we've run into this yet.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.840]   And mostly, it's a social contract between you
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.160]   and the people in the Hangout.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.200]   That's what we figured out.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.040]   You've probably got your ducks lined up
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.040]   and clearances from everybody in this Hangout
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.080]   so that you won't consume the react of this.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.640]   So I mean, I think the biggest liability would be to you
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.640]   individually.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.760]   So I--
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.400]   That's fine.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.720]   Hey, can I ask you one more question?
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.680]   How do you get the widescreen?
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.640]   That's cool.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.240]   What's that?
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.920]   You got widescreen there, Bradley.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.160]   Why are you doing that?
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.760]   Is that some spice?
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.960]   No, that's good.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.240]   Everybody else is 4'3", or 16'9".
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.600]   I don't understand how you're doing it.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.840]   Everybody else is 4'3", or 16'9".
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.400]   I don't understand how you're doing it.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.760]   I don't know either.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.600]   Talk to our end here, so compliment them.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.080]   That's--
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:01.600]   Well done.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.240]   Yeah, we'll do something for you in here.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.480]   All right, I'm going to mute that just briefly.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.880]   But here's another tweet that I'd like.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.240]   Jason Sype, SEI-PP says that, "Imagine the implications
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.040]   Google+ can have for education and online classes--
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.520]   It's distilling Google Docs."
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.760]   Yes.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.200]   Yes.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.960]   Tutoring sessions, lectures and tutoring sessions,
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.520]   chat on the side.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.640]   This blows up education, which would be a good thing.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.600]   Somebody else asks a Twitter, Leo,
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.040]   don't you have any commercials today?
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.240]   No, we've decided to do--
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.800]   as a pro bono, we've decided to do a commercial-free show
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.120]   today so that we'd have as much time as possible
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:38.880]   to talk about Google+.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.380]   Really?
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.440]   Right on.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.400]   Oh, well, the audience is grateful.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.480]   This is-- this is--
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   No.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.280]   No, actually, I do have a couple of commercials,
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.840]   which I have deferred, because I think we don't want
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.640]   to take the time on commercials we really want to talk about.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.380]   This has been more of the most interactive, coolest
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.920]   twigs I think we've ever had.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.200]   I am just telling you.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.080]   I mean, and just to have people like Bradley hanging out
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   in the hangout there is pretty amazing.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:06.880]   Pretty incredible.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   I'll tell you what, we can wrap this up here.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.680]   I mean, we didn't cover any other Google news.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.080]   We didn't do a tip or a tibler.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.680]   I didn't mean to bring an end to this.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.000]   This was the story.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.760]   I think that we have the story of the week.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.880]   I think this may be the largest, most important Google product
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.960]   release that I can remember, and certainly in some time.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:29.960]   Since our show.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.120]   Since we started Twig, for sure.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.080]   Wave, Buzz, even Android.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:34.800]   This is huge.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.120]   This is huge.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.360]   Well, Android.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360]   All right, maybe Android.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.120]   There is one other story, which
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.720]   is that Andrew Rubin tweeted that Google is activating now
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:48.640]   half a million Android handsets a day, a day.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.720]   I know there are a lot of people in Plus and the Plus
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.880]   Field Test who wish they had Android for the instant upload
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880]   in Huddle.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.680]   I think it's great that Vic immediately jumped in and said,
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.360]   yes, we're doing an iOS version.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.480]   But you've got to think there's a little bit of them,
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.960]   little bit of people at Google would say,
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.120]   kind of don't hurry too fast.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.120]   Ooh, oh.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.120]   Oh, thank you.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.760]   Oh, thanks for a pesky approval process.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.200]   Steve may not like this.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.720]   Well, here's the thing that--
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.400]   why would we Bradley back again last night?
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.600]   But I think that the thing that people like us really want
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.640]   is integration with Google Apps accounts.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.440]   Because I'm now in this with my lesser account.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.320]   And Bradley, you said last night that, yes, you're well
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.480]   aware of the pressure to do that.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.280]   Right?
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.680]   I would say it's the single biggest--
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.360]   yeah, it's the single biggest bit of feedback we got
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:44.120]   was that a lot of our best and earliest customers,
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.480]   our Google Apps customers, and we have cut them out
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.720]   of their opportunity to use their authentic selves
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.160]   in this product, we're going to fix that, I promise you.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.680]   No, how is that going to work probably?
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.520]   All right, so now-- but I'm establishing an asset
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:03.120]   with my work account when I can switch over
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.320]   to my real account, which is where all my real people are.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.760]   How do you imagine that might work?
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.320]   Am I going to have to restart over again, or what do you think?
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320]   I hope not.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.320]   I agree.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   We've created a challenge in that people's identities
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.320]   are often siloed.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   I use multi log in to manage the different aspects of myself.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:27.320]   But when you-- sometimes also people invest in their apps
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.320]   account, and then they leave the university,
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.320]   and they want to take some of that with them,
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.320]   pursue it to the IP who owns what.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320]   We have to solve these problems.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320]   We have to give you a way to migrate your data out
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.320]   and get it where you are next.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   But it's not just the siloing.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   It's not just the siloing, Bradley.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320]   I think it's also just the fact that--
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   I don't try the silo.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   It's not because of that.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   I don't want to keep them separate.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.320]   But I do-- I also don't want to lose.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.320]   Actually, what are the opposite of siloing?
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.320]   I want to merge them.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   That's probably a technical challenge, yes?
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:07.320]   I see that there's already data liberation.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.320]   Download your circles in contacts option in plus settings.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   That's great.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   That's great to see this early on.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.320]   Yes.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.320]   We came out of the gate with us.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.320]   Thanks to Brian Fitzpatrick in the data liberation truck.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.320]   The reach of FITZ is broad.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.320]   Yes.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.320]   The held your hostage until it was done.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.320]   FITZ, by the way, brought a brick.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.320]   I'll do an ad.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.320]   FITZ bought a brick in the Twit Brick House that's going to have
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.320]   the data liberation front logo on it,
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.320]   which I think is awesome.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   I'm glad to support that.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.320]   I should have just given to it for free.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.320]   Hey, you want to spend the money?
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.320]   It's OK.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.320]   I'll take it.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   [laughter]
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.320]   ricks.twit.tv if you want your company's logo on the wall
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.320]   at the brick to it has.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.320]   Hey, Brad, I want to thank you so much and Vic too for being part
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.320]   of the show and then coming back, which is even better.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   Let me ask you the question that I asked Will earlier.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320]   You find a lot of the team.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.320]   A lot of Googlers are out there in Hangouts online talking to people
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   and helping users, that kind of thing.
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.320]   Oh, gosh, yes.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.320]   The team is really enthused.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.320]   As you can imagine, we haven't disclosed numbers,
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.320]   but an abnormally high fraction of the people you're interacting
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320]   with right now are Googlers.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.320]   We've been the whole company along with us.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.320]   That will change over time, but we're doing this because we want
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320]   to listen and engage with people.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.320]   We'll find this being extremely interactive and everybody's
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.320]   prepared and ready for that.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.320]   We're talking with the engineers and the designers and the product
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.320]   people that built this.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.320]   They're engaged in every thread, so please give your feedback directly
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.320]   to them and it will make a difference.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.320]   Thank you, Brad, for being part of the show.
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.320]   We really appreciate it.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320]   Thank Vic too for us.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.320]   One of the most awe-inspiring things of this whole thing was the
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.320]   incredible secrecy.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   All the speculation over the last two years about Google and
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320]   social.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.320]   Man, you obviously imprisoned your employees for two years.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.320]   David, you can't wait with that.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.320]   I think people believed in what we were doing and were excited
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   about what we were doing and such kept a secret.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:17.320]   The only leaks that were material, there were some buzz
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.320]   about circles three, four months ago around South by Southwest.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.320]   A fair amount of detective work was done on some of the JavaScript
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.320]   through profiles.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   Sprites were reverse engineered and some things they got.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.320]   But in general, the story that we told yesterday, I think,
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320]   surprised most of the world.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.320]   Yes.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   Yeah, I did.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320]   Well done.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.320]   I envision 500 Googlers coming out of a basement right now seeing
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.320]   the sunlight for the first time in plugs.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320]   Well, this has been a lot of fun.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:01.320]   I really want to thank all of our kind of ad hoc contributors
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:06.320]   in the show, including Will Norris, who's on the team for Google
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.320]   Plus, Trey Radcliffe, our great friend and photographers from
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:14.320]   StuckandCustoms.com, Robert Scobel, of course a Scobelizer,
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.320]   and Gary, keep calling you Gary Doug K from the Conversations
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:23.320]   Network for joining us and adding their two cents.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:27.320]   Already we see the value of Hangout, just pretty amazing.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:32.320]   And I just said on the chat room, chat room, we still love you.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   Oh, yeah, I'm just going to have to get another computer.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   The reason I haven't done much of the chat room is because they're
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   on the same computer as the Hangout is.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.320]   And so guys, we haven't left you.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.320]   I like what CR said, "Hangout is the chat you date.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.320]   IRC is the chat you marry."
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   What is the chat you kill?
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   No, no, no.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   In fact, IRC is kind of remarkable.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.320]   It is one of the oldest internet protocols.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.320]   I think it predates the World Wide Web.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:05.320]   It is considered by many to be the geekiest, maybe after Usenet.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:09.320]   And yet it is very effective, and we've used it very effectively.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:15.320]   I think there's going to be a lot of other ways that we can use this
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.320]   in conjunction with other social things.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.320]   But I'm pretty excited about Google+.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.320]   I think there's a lot to be said about.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.320]   And I think you, Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani for joining us and
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.320]   talking about it.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.320]   And for Jeff, I thank you for the invite because it was your
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.320]   invite that got me in.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.320]   So I appreciate it.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.320]   I think Karen, I've got to thank Karen Wickory.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   Karen sent me 15 invites, and we did in fact invite the team.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   But mine didn't go through.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   There's did.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320]   Geez.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.320]   Maybe because that Google Apps problem could have been the Google Apps problem.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   If I could have put in a number of people using their Google Apps address,
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.320]   I'm going to have to fix that.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.320]   We also want to thank our friends at NewTech.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   You know, we are building a new studio.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320]   You probably heard a little bit about that.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   And we have many, many partners who are helping us out with technology to make it
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   possible.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   None more important than NewTech.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:10.320]   They make the switcher that I use to do things like this, and this, and this, and this.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.320]   And that switcher is really critical to our operation.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.320]   We're getting a mighty big upgrade.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.320]   We've been using a TriCaster broadcast for the last few years.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.320]   We are now getting the TCXD 850.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:28.320]   This is the new high def, completely redesigned, super powerful TriCaster from
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.320]   NewTech.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.320]   It's basically a live production truck in a box.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.320]   22 channels for you, rack mount system.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.320]   It's going to give us high def.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:44.320]   It's going to give us capabilities that you will not believe, including 18 HD live virtual
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.320]   sets.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.320]   We can do sound, video titles, stills, motion graphics finally.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.320]   So when I say Jeff Jarvis and your name flies in, Jeff, don't get scared.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.320]   Don't get tacky on us.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   No, no.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.320]   I could have gotten tacky before.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   I have the tacky capabilities built into this existing TriCaster.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.320]   You know, I can do things like this.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.320]   But do I?
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.320]   No, you don't.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.320]   Only once in a while.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.320]   But yeah, there's a lot more we can do.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.320]   By the way, a lot of people use TriCaster, including Kevin Pollock, his chat show,
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:25.320]   Peter Hemillins, Fures World MTV, ESPN, the NBA Development League, WNBA, Fox Sports,
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:29.320]   the NHL, a lot of churches, a lot of youth groups, a lot of organizations.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:35.320]   For more information on TriCaster, visit NewTech, any W-T-E-K dot com, and really
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:40.320]   a sincere tip of the hat to NewTech because the TriCaster has been a really valuable
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.320]   part of the Twit Network and we want to thank them because they have essentially
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:48.320]   donated an 850 to our new production facility, which is fantastic.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.320]   They're revolutionizing television.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.320]   We couldn't do it without them.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.320]   I mean, really, I couldn't even consider this without something that I could afford.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.320]   I bought this TriCaster.
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.320]   It was 10 grand at the time.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:02.320]   And, you know, that sounds like a lot of money.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.320]   It's $1 million worth of production facility in a box.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.320]   Jeff Jarvis, his new book is coming out in September.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.320]   How exciting, Jeff?
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320]   We're thrilled.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.320]   It's called Public Parts.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320]   Can't wait to read it.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.320]   Simon and Schuster, when are we getting our press copies, Jeff?
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.320]   I don't want you to have the galleys because there's mistakes in there and drop type,
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   so when I get the real books, I'll send you autograph ones.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.320]   Can't wait.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.320]   Really look forward to it.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.320]   And I would appreciate that autograph.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.320]   Jeff is also bloging at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.320]   And he's @JeffJharves on Twitter.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   Gina Trapani, of course.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   Whoops.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   Whoopsies.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   I make Twitter a clip.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   Whoa!
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.320]   Whoa!
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:50.320]   Gina Trapani, the dizzy Gina Trapani is at SmarterWare.org.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.320]   Look for a blog post on what Google learned from the Buzz and Wave launches.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.320]   It's at SmarterWare.org.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.320]   Very good article.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:04.320]   She's also @GinaTrapani on the Twitter and a beloved friend.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.320]   I want to thank you both because I could tell you something.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.320]   [laughter]
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320]   This is a great show today, Leah.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.320]   Thank you.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:21.320]   We could not do this show without the two journalists with the prestige and stature of Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.320]   You're absolutely critical to this.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   Jeff, what a get to get Bradley and Vic on the show.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320]   Huge.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.320]   Huge.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.320]   So it would be the power hangouts instantly.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.320]   Boy did it.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.320]   Boy did it.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.320]   Well, that was the joy that Google had on this.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.320]   They said the PR people were saying, "Look, look at the benefit that already came from hanging out in the hangouts."
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.320]   They got something to plug, didn't they?
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.320]   Yeah, they did.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:48.320]   Hey, one more thing we can gush over with in plus, just Leo.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.320]   Can you show this?
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.320]   This is really cool.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.320]   And this is one of the most unexpected, kind of cool features.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320]   I'm ready.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.320]   If you're in plus, the gear on the top right hand corner,
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.320]   you can click that, it's options.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.320]   Okay.
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.320]   I got to go back to my plus here.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.320]   Okay, there's a gear in the upper right hand corner.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.320]   I see that.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.320]   Options.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   Let me zoom in a little bit on that.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.320]   Choose send feedback.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.320]   Send feedback.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.320]   Okay.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:18.320]   And now analyzing the page, now what you can do is you can, it takes a screenshot of the current page.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:23.320]   You can highlight the problem area and blackout private information.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.320]   Wow.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.320]   And then send, describe the problem that you're having and then preview the bug report.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.320]   Wow.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.320]   This is like, this sets the standard for, so go in another area that's not highlighted so
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.320]   you can blackout.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.320]   Okay, blackout all that.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.320]   Okay.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.320]   And then redacted.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.320]   Redacted.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:49.320]   And you describe the problem and then you can preview and you can see everything that you're sending to Google, the entire screenshot, your browser details.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.320]   This is awesome, awesome.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   This is an incredible feedback tool.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.320]   No, it is great.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   Mark, Mark Pinkas said that he also wanted a place where he could send just features because though a bug can be a feature or a feature isn't a bug.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.320]   Well, it says feedback.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   It doesn't say bug.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.320]   It says feedback.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.320]   My feedback is, I love this way too much.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.320]   Could you have made it a little bit less useful?
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.320]   Thank you.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.320]   I'm never going to get another thing done.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.320]   And look at all this additional information, annotations, page information.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.320]   This for the engineers.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.320]   Look at this.
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.320]   This is all the browser.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.320]   It's incredible.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.320]   This is incredible.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:22.320]   I mean, this is, this is awesome.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:27.320]   This is like, this is transparency and showing what am I sending to Google when I'm reporting a problem?
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:32.320]   Which when you're reporting a problem about personal, you know, a page that can include personal information is kind of important.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.320]   Anyway, I know that's like it's the nerdiest thing ever.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   That's your tip.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   Love send feedback.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320]   Jeff, you had a number?
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.320]   Yeah, I did.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.320]   What was, what was in here?
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320]   Let's see.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.320]   As well.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320]   As well.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:50.320]   It was, if we don't feel too sorry for Facebook, 280%, that's how much is advertising revenue is up.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.320]   Okay.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:56.320]   And my, my tool of the week, absolutely get Google plus on your Android phone.
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.320]   It rocks.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.320]   It'll blow it up.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.320]   Mine's been buzzing through the show.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.320]   It's, it's fun.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:12.320]   It's a gift in a way to those of us who love technology to get a new tool to play with that has so much potential is so intriguing.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.320]   And so many nooks and crannies.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:20.320]   And so while I'm sure there's downsides and negatives to this, and I don't want to sound like a gushing Google fan boy.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   And I'm sure I do at this point.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   Here he goes.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320]   I think this is pretty damn cool.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.320]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.320]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.320]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:34.320]   We do this show every week live at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern live.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.320]   Twitter.tv on Wednesdays.
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.320]   Please tune in and join us.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320]   We loved having you watch live.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:43.320]   And I think we'll probably will start using Hangout in addition to our IRC channel to get some interaction.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:49.320]   But we'll probably do that by invitation because I think that would be fun is to do a kind of mini Gilmore gang capability where we have some people that we have.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:54.320]   We really want to have as not maybe a full panelist, but as a part of the conversation.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.320]   I think there's all sorts of ways we can use this.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.320]   We're just going to start to start playing with this.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.320]   If you miss the show, don't worry.
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.320]   You can get it at twit.tv/twig.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.320]   T-W-I-T.TV/T-W-I-G.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.320]   And of course, on iTunes soon everywhere else.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   Yes, Jeff.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.320]   One last thing.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320]   I know you all want them.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.320]   We don't have any invites.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.320]   We had to give our 15 before we got in.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.320]   So I would love to give you invites.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320]   None of us has any invites.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   And you heard I begged.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   I begged.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.320]   I pleaded.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.320]   I asked for invites.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   And you heard me actually be turned down in a nice way.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.320]   Even Leo.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.320]   So don't ask us.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.320]   We don't have them.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:34.320]   But you can go to plus.google.com.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.320]   Is that where you go?
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.320]   I think so.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.320]   And you can ask for an invite.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.320]   And I bet you that they'll roll us out pretty.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.320]   Because you know what?
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.320]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.320]   You've been losing it for much longer than I have Gina.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.320]   I've only been using it for an hour and a half.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:46.320]   It seems pretty stable.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.320]   It's pretty stable.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:50.320]   I had a few moments where avatars were broken.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.320]   Things seemed a little slow.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.320]   I got an error message.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.320]   But for the most part, it's stable.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.320]   I do think that they're dealing with some stability problems.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.320]   I hope they'll roll us out soon though because they have an
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.320]   initial wave of enthusiasm from us.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.320]   We're not the only ones who are enthusiastic about it.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.320]   And I think that they would do well to roll out steadily and
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.320]   quickly as quickly as possible.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:09.320]   So over the next few weeks anyway.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.320]   So I hope to see that.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   That's great.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.320]   Well, thank you Gina.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.320]   Thank you Jeff.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.320]   Thank you everybody for watching the show.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:19.320]   The autumn leaves of change are blowing through the studio slowly.
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   Well, I have control.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.320]   I can make them below left or below right.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   I can do it all.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.320]   But that means we are out of time.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.320]   So say goodbye.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.320]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.320]   Bye bye.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:41.320]   [MUSIC]
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:43.560]   (chimes)
