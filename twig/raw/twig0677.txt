[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   It's time for Twig this week at Google Stacey and Jeff.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.840]   They're all here.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.520]   And what a surprise Android 13 is here.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.600]   It's rolling out now to Pixel phones
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.880]   to talk about some of the features.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.600]   We'll also talk about Thursday night football.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.840]   Amazon's got it.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.320]   What are they going to do with it?
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.720]   The rubber ducky.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   Watch out.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.960]   Don't put that in your USB port.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.560]   And Oracle is now in charge of TikTok's algorithms.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.280]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.520]   On Twig.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.360]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.880]   From people you trust.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.280]   This is Twig.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.880]   This is Twig.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.120]   This week in Google, episode 677, recorded Wednesday,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.040]   August 17, 2022.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.560]   Clemson Salmon.

[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520]   Let me get time off for it.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.600]   This week in Google, the show we talk about everything,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.080]   but Google, ha-ha!
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.960]   Except today, we're going to throw you a curve.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   Ant Proit is here from Hands On Photography.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.040]   Twit.tv/hoppies, also our community manager
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.800]   in the fabulous club Twit.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.320]   And just a great guy to have around.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.480]   Hi, Ant.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.160]   Hello, sir.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.880]   Hi, you be you.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.000]   I am wonderful.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.240]   But a very, very festive mood today.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.600]   I don't know why.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.080]   But I am just supposed to use rollers.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.960]   You seem like it.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.720]   I've heard of talk of TikTok and pre-show songs.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.480]   That's what it was.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.240]   It cheered me up.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.000]   In the movie, the mood.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.680]   We were dancing to ringtones with Mr.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.880]   Jeff Jarvis, the London Tap Professor
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.560]   for journalistic innovation at the Craig--
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   Craig.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   Craig.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.720]   Newmark.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.280]   Graduate School of Journalism at the SITD University
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.760]   of New York.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   Do they have a dance like--
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.280]   Oh, boss.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   --C-U-N-Y.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.120]   D-D-D-D-C-U-N-Y.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.160]   And our football games, yeah.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.360]   At the big football.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.080]   Yeah, the big football powers.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.880]   CUNY.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.120]   Big-- the big football power.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.200]   CUNY's stick ball.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.440]   Pickleball.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.560]   And here she is, the star of Pickleball, Bainbridge.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520]   Stacey Higginbotham and Stacey on IOT.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.000]   Pickleball Historian.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.080]   Pickleball Historian.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.160]   Stacey Higginball.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.960]   Nothing to do with Pickleball.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   She doesn't.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.560]   Everything to do with the IOT.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.760]   You're married to Pickleball.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   That's the thing.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.840]   I'm a Pickleball widow.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.680]   Pickleball widow.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.440]   Stacey on IOT.com, the website, the podcast, the IOT podcast
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.640]   with Kevin Tofol, of course, her newsletter, which
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.560]   is highly recommended to all.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.840]   Google threw us a big curve yesterday.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.400]   They released Android 13.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   What?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.080]   You were expecting 14?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.760]   No, you were expecting September.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.360]   I started with it.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.880]   I missed that.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.840]   I went from this way.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.440]   I usually go that way.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.360]   But this time I went this way.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   I went left to right, said a right to left.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.200]   Have I mentioned that I have a cold in a pair of--
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.680]   It's okay.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.920]   --just zoning in and out?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.280]   It's okay.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.040]   You're just going to be fine.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   You're just going to be fine.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.000]   Have you waffled up yet?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.240]   Pixel folks, you can now get Android 13.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.400]   Roughly a month ahead of schedule, I think.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.920]   Usually they release it with the release of the hardware,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.400]   Pixel 7.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   Still don't know when that's going to be.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.280]   It's not surprising because beta 6 came out last week,
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.400]   and it was pretty solid.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.240]   It uses-- there are quite a few features.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.040]   In fact, Michelle Raman, who is a regular on--
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.800]   he works at Asperio, but he's a regular on all about Android,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.560]   has his Android 13 change log, which Jeff pointed out
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.600]   is a 169 minute read.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.040]   It is a lot of--
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.120]   It is a deep, deep thing.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.360]   And we could take the rest of the show and then some to talk--
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.560]   Holy cow.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.400]   To talk about all this stuff.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.480]   I did not get it yet.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.040]   I think it's a rollout.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.560]   It will go to other phones, of course.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.680]   But usually, pixels get the newest version of Android way
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.760]   ahead of everybody else.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.360]   And you can't go back.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.400]   Oh, that's a big part of the story.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.080]   I don't remember that happening before.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.720]   Maybe it did.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.640]   They did, do I.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   I was like, I don't think so, but I'm not an Android historian,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.000]   so I don't know.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.800]   I mean, you could root the phone and go back, obviously.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.280]   But Google gives you no way to roll back.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.720]   So should we start with the letter A?
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.480]   How about we start with the letter P as in performance?
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   Is this going to run for day or--
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.840]   I've--
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.000]   Or should we go to--
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.560]   A game.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.240]   Interface, user interface.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.840]   Is it going to be a craptastic mess as the previous version was?
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.560]   People on the--
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.960]   I thought you were not bitter anymore, Ed.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.000]   I thought you were happy now.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.040]   Again, the DAGUM hardware is--
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.440]   I thought the team is now officially running out for Google.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.940]   Oh, sorry.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.880]   I'm just playing out for Google.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.280]   Sorry, stop making noise there.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.120]   Thank you.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.520]   I'm playing the 9 to 5 Google video with all the features.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.480]   I wonder how long that is.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   That's 23 minutes.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.240]   They must move a little faster than Michelle.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.640]   But the people who have been using the beta ant to answer
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.480]   your question--
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.520]   and I've been following this on Reddit--
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.840]   have been pretty happy with it.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.240]   They say the battery life is better for the most part.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.200]   They say the fingerprint reader works very nicely now.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.880]   The biggest thing is you're absolutely right
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.000]   is how it looks.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.440]   Material design is now throughout and even many apps,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.480]   all the app icons, everything.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.640]   Is that a picture of--
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.120]   Tim Cook.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.200]   That's a picture of Tim.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.960]   Tim Cook.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.400]   So whoever this is, Android 9 to 5 Google--
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.960]   A trader.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.800]   Is a trader.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.720]   Trader.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.800]   Is a trader a trolling?
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.920]   I think he's probably trolling, don't you think?
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.640]   There are a few other interesting features
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.000]   according to 9 to 5 Google at the highest level.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.240]   You can--
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.000]   Smart Home Control show up on the lock screen.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.280]   I know Stacey will be happy with that.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.240]   You don't have to unlock your phone, for instance,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.480]   to turn off your lights.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.520]   So they brought that back because they had said they
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.760]   moved it for security reasons.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.240]   Oh, interesting.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.040]   It's optional.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.200]   Users can determine whether it's enabled in the display
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.840]   settings.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.560]   Quick settings have been reorganized.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.600]   This is a look at the quick settings.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.160]   Did it have spatial audio before?
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.920]   No, I think that's new.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.120]   In fact, Bluetooth is also--
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.440]   I thought that was on the app, or, right?
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.400]   Bluetooth has also been updated.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.840]   There's a new Bluetooth audio codec.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.560]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.720]   Just a lot of stuff.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.440]   I don't know.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.000]   Did they cover this on all about Android yesterday?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.080]   Jason, did you cover it?
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.760]   I feel like they might have just snuck up on them.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.200]   Oh, you did.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.680]   OK.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.440]   They did.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.360]   So if you weren't all the details, snuck up on me.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.400]   I didn't know about it till later.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.120]   You're not watching all about Android?
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.040]   I have duties at home.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.000]   Great show.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.760]   I've got to scrub the floors, set the fires up
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.880]   for the next morning, make sure the chamber pots are clean.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.600]   That kind of thing.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.400]   I'm a busy person at night.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.640]   No, I missed it, unfortunately.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.160]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.200]   You can now toggle a flashlight quickly, which is great.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.400]   Really great.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.280]   I like that.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.320]   That's a simple pleasure for someone
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.120]   that takes their dogs out at night.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.840]   The Android 13 Easter egg.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.360]   Google continuing with that tradition.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.560]   Go to Settings, About Phone.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   Go to the Android version, and quickly tap 13.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.320]   And something magical will happen.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.000]   I think one of the reasons--
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.600]   I'm curious why they released it roughly a month early
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   or earlier than anybody expected.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.680]   I think one of the reasons might be tablets.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.560]   Remember, Google has been making Android better for tablets,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.840]   they say.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.400]   And I'm wondering if they want to announce a tablet
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.080]   or others are going to announce a tablet.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.320]   The task bar has application suggestions
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.080]   and a drawer to access your apps and open them in split screen
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.920]   mode via drag and dropped.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.720]   Multi-window mode now on by default for all apps.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.000]   So this is looking a little bit more like the new iPad
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.960]   multi-window operating system.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.080]   Anyway, surprise.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   It's here.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.600]   Android 13 with the August security patches is live.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.520]   You can download pixel factory images and over the air,
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.240]   although, again, not for everybody, all at once.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.640]   Get in line, queue up.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.160]   Beta program does remain open.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.600]   If you are in the beta and you've been using the beta,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.760]   there will be a chance to test feature drops as they come up.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.440]   They now do those monthly.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.240]   After those enrolled in the program
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.120]   get the final release, you could opt out.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.280]   If you go to the developer site, google.com/android,
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.200]   go to the beta section.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.400]   You can opt out and you won't have to wipe your phone again.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.000]   No, nice.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.360]   But do make sure you have the final version before you quit.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.520]   You kind of have this window between the final version of 13
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.280]   and then the starting the new betas, the feature drop betas.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.640]   AOSP, the open source project, will get Android 13,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.000]   which means that other manufacturers
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.280]   can start working on vetting it for their platforms,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.800]   including the Samsung's Asus HMD, which
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.880]   are the Nokia phones Motorola 1 plus Oppo, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.080]   Shao Mi.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.240]   So for all the deets, I think all about Android's a place to go.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:53.960]   Because there's 169 minutes of features.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.280]   Can I change my colors to be the colors that I actually want
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.920]   instead of these?
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.640]   Nope.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.040]   It's got to be the wallpaper color.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.560]   Sorry.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   [GROANING]
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   Colors, do you want?
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.920]   Yep.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.200]   Not this what they're called an orange, which looks like salmon.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.800]   It's not the same.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   It's just not the same.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.640]   They try to match it up with my image background, which has
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.040]   orange, because it's got clumps and a clumps in picture.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.680]   But everything sort of looks like this salmon color
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.240]   and a little bit of magenta.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.320]   It's just not my thing, but had to deal with it,
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.720]   because there's no other way to change it.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.480]   See that that or green or some crap?
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.760]   So apparently, I didn't realize this 12L had--
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.520]   I had not upgraded to 12L, but 12L had some form of spatial
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.400]   audio.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.640]   But now they've got head tracking support.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.840]   So as you move your head around, spatial audio produces
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.520]   immersive audio that comes from all around you.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.120]   Of course, your media has to be multi-channel.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.160]   On Apple's, it still be at most encoding.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.400]   I'm not sure what they're using here.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.720]   Devices with an audio spatializer service may have a toggle
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.960]   in Bluetooth settings to enable spatial audio.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.320]   Have you used spatial audio?
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.800]   I have.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.200]   And how Huawei is it?
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.840]   So Apple, when they rolled it out--
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.160]   Apple's very good at marketing-- they had a playlist
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.560]   to show you the difference.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.320]   And they had one of their DJs from their radio service come on
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.360]   and say, now this is what mono sounded like.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.080]   And then along came stereo.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.120]   And it opened it up.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.920]   And so you go from mono to stereo.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.600]   But now the next wave, and they had go to spatial.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.120]   And it's kind of like the difference in mono and stereo.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.000]   The sound stage gets bigger.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.200]   But there's a problem with spatial audio,
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.080]   which is you don't really want tuba's come from behind you.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.560]   You know, we're all kind of conditioned
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.760]   to the idea that even at a concert or at a movie
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.000]   or anywhere you're listening to music,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.880]   the music is in front of you.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.560]   So stereo makes sense because now you
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.000]   have a sound stage in front of you with left and right.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.440]   For instance, when they do spatial audio of classical music,
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.200]   it still comes from in front of you.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.360]   What you get in the spatial stuff is more echoes
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.640]   from the behind you, you know, it gives you--
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.800]   Or from the room, right?
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.360]   The room feel.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.720]   But then there's people with pop--
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.080]   For VR, that makes sense to us.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.680]   Yeah, well, no, even for like, you want a concert hall
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.600]   experience, but the problem is pop music and other music,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.560]   which is not recorded in a concert hall,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.400]   they will put the flutes up in the air,
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.120]   the tuba's behind you and stuff.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.840]   And it just, to me, it's a little gimmicky.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.240]   Maybe we're just getting used to it.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   They're just learning about it.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.640]   But isn't it more for like the gaming experience?
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.880]   No, no, no.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.400]   Apple's pushing all music.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.160]   They're pushing all producers.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.200]   Produced your music in Dolby Atmos.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.120]   They've got tools to do it.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.680]   And they're pitching it like NPR podcasting people
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.520]   want to use it too.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   Sure.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.800]   The sound of the door creaking can be over here over there.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.960]   Well, but you can do that with stereo.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.840]   You only have two ears.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.680]   And you are able to simulate--
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.680]   For yourself.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   That sounds staged.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.040]   I'm torn between its gimmicky and its--
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.000]   Apple's pitching it as like, first there is mono,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.400]   then there was stereo, now there's spatial.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.080]   It's like that big of a jump.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.560]   Quadrophonic, yeah.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.600]   Yeah, we had quadrophonic back in the day.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.560]   Maybe, I mean, maybe for--
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.920]   I'm just trying to think about things like,
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.760]   if you imagine the metaverse, right?
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.720]   So if you imagine that you could actually
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.120]   be immersed in the space and look around--
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.480]   Oh, you'll need it for games in metaverse, yes.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:50.840]   I agree.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.960]   Yeah, well, I'm just thinking, if everything
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.040]   becomes highly personalized and is in the virtual environment,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.520]   then it might make sense to be like, look,
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.000]   every experience is unique.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.480]   You can have this experience like everybody
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.640]   is playing literally just for you.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.080]   I don't know.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.400]   I'm just trying to think about it like--
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.080]   I don't-- at all question, it's usefulness in gaming.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.440]   They've had it for a long time in gaming or metaverse
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.880]   applications where stuff is all around you.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.080]   I'm thinking, for music, to me, I think it's probably not
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.040]   as big a leap as mono-disterea.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.000]   It's kind of--
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.800]   If done right, it's OK.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.400]   But have you listened to it too?
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.440]   Anne, I mean, are you?
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.160]   No, I haven't.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.520]   I just listened to what you describe.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.000]   It just makes more sense, far as how big the leap was
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.400]   from mono to stereo, far as music.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.920]   That was huge.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.800]   And that's kind of why Apple did this whole thing.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.120]   See, here's mono, here's stereo now, here's spatial.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.640]   But it's not--
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.160]   And I went out just to try it to get apples.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.920]   I got the expensive Apple Max headphones
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.640]   and they are popular--
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.520]   Your favorite?
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.800]   But the problem with that is that's Bluetooth.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.280]   And Bluetooth is highly compressed.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.680]   So the music is not as good as on good headphones.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.960]   But I think it works still with regular headphones wired
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.080]   if you do it right.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   And you can hear it.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.720]   You can hear it in speakers, too, by the way.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.560]   Don't have to wear headphones to get it.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.240]   And it's a little more spacious.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.440]   There's a better sound stage.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   I think if it's used-- if it's done properly,
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.800]   it probably is an improvement.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.400]   It's-- to me, it's a little--
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.240]   it's not gimmicky, but it's a little overhyped, perhaps.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.560]   Anyway--
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.280]   For the answer.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.040]   You can get it.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.880]   Yeah, I over-answered.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.560]   But thank you for--
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.040]   Would you like to hear my 169 minute explanation?
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.480]   Let's see.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.680]   There is now screen resolution settings in Android 13.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.120]   I think that tells you a little bit about the tablet future.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.960]   Lots of stuff.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.200]   Lots of guest profiles.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.720]   Clipboard editor overlay.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.200]   I'm just looking at Michelle's very long list.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.560]   I'm curious to see how many more Android tablets
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.520]   will be seen in the wild once this release happens.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.200]   If it's something that's going to really harness
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.440]   the power of a tablet's display, will people really
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.240]   decide to get more interested in it?
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.440]   Beyond the iPad, because right now it's
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.880]   pretty much just the Samsung devices, if that.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.600]   But most times an iPad, you see out there.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Even at a DAGUM gas station, it's an iPad.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.760]   Maybe related--
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.920]   As an Android tablet.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.560]   I think there's going to be a lot-- and I think Google's
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.200]   going to announce one, honestly.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.000]   Remember, I owe they were talking about how they're
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.960]   going to do better support.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.080]   I feel like they're angling to announce it.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.320]   Sorry to say not a Pixelbook.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:37.840]   Jeff--
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.600]   [GASPING]
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.480]   Wipe the tears, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.280]   He already got something.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.440]   We can stop feeling so sad for him.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.240]   No, feel sad for me.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.800]   Android police says that the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro--
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.840]   the phones that Google also teased at Google I/O
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.600]   may have just passed through the FCC.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.840]   So they're poised.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.280]   They're ready for a launch sometime soon.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.800]   I mentioned that in the past, Google's
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.360]   announced it ahead of Apple and after Apple.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.320]   There is a strong rumor now that Apple's event will be
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   September 7th.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.960]   So if Google's going to announce their Pixel 7,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.880]   they got a couple weeks before Apple,
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.920]   they got a couple weeks to do that.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.960]   If they're going to do it after Apple, well,
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.960]   then they got a lot more.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   My Nexus 7.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.040]   I missed the Nexus 7.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.880]   Wasn't that great?
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.200]   But you know what?
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.920]   They killed the habit of it.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.520]   If they'd made that continuously,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.480]   I'd still have the latest Nexus 7.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:32.840]   But now--
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.720]   I agree.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.880]   You'd have life without it.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.960]   Granted, if it still ran in to a 12,
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.400]   I don't know that's a different story.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:45.040]   But the Pixel 7 is probably close to 7 inches.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.280]   You know, new iPhone's going to be 6.7 inches.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.800]   I bet you this is 6.7, 6.8.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.960]   So you're getting the 7-inch tablet.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.440]   It's just a phone.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.320]   How big is the Pixel 6?
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.600]   That's a good question.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.120]   I don't know.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.160]   I think it's about 6.7 inches.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.960]   Yeah, because this doesn't feel like the Nexus 7.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.800]   6.7 inches.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.320]   Yeah, yeah, well, it's still different.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.760]   So it's a little-- that 0.3 inches makes all the difference,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.240]   huh?
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.760]   No, no, it was-- I don't know.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.720]   Bezels.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.040]   It had big bezels.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.480]   Yeah, big bezels, yeah.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.160]   It had big bezels.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.720]   Yeah, it did.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.040]   So I'm sure that the 7 will be at least 6.7.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.840]   I don't think it'll get much bigger,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   because that seems to be the sweet spot.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.080]   6.7 inches.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.200]   Anyway, see?
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.880]   We started with Google News.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.120]   So the reason, just so you know why you can't roll back to 12,
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.400]   is because of a security issue.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.000]   Google released Android 13 today.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.920]   This is 9.5.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.440]   Google, it's a permanent upgrade.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.520]   This is unusual.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.880]   Android updates are usually reversible.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.600]   If you could sideload it, but you will have to reset the phone.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.000]   I bet you could still do this, but maybe you have to root it first.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   This is Google, says where it hosts the factory images.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.200]   Warning, the Android 13 update for the Pixel 6,
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   Pixel 6 Pro and the Pixel 6A contains a bootloader update.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.000]   Oh, that increments the anti-rollback version.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.440]   After flashing an Android 13 build in these devices,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.280]   you will not be able to flash older Android 12 builds.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.120]   Oh, that means you can't even sideload it, yeah.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.160]   Sounds like you can't even--
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.680]   yeah.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:35.320]   All right.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.880]   This is truly irreversible.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.360]   Google says the bootloader version used previously
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.800]   had a security vulnerability.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.760]   OK.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.360]   Michelle Raman, one of the first to bring it to our attention.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.600]   Google warning reads, if this is flashed,
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.560]   you cannot go back to an old Android build.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.880]   This is on your current version.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.440]   Android 12, your device is running a vulnerable version
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.840]   of the bootloader.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.240]   After flashing this build, your device's anti-rollback counter
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.160]   will be incremented to prevent previous vulnerable versions
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.880]   of the bootloader from being flashed on the device
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.720]   in the future.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.920]   Wow.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:18.680]   Is the bootloader part of the AOS ASAP
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.120]   to where we can go to someone outside of Google
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.080]   to investigate whether this flaw was there or not.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.200]   Or is this just Google saying, you
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.840]   know what, we're tired of this particular version.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.320]   We're going to lock it down.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.840]   Same way Apple sort of does these types of restrictions
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   with no rhyme or reason, just because they can.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:42.320]   The bootloader is vendor proprietary.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.240]   OK.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.320]   So that's why--
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.240]   so it's not part of AOSP.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.520]   OK.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.560]   So that's why, for instance, Samsung
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.160]   has done this in the past with what they call it triangle,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.680]   with a triangle update to prevent people
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.080]   from flashing, rooting and flashing alternate firmware
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.640]   on there.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.840]   It would have a little triangle that you only had.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.120]   I think you could only do it three times,
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.600]   or something I can't remember, I dimly remember the details.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.040]   But various manufacturers have had modified boot
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.280]   loaders that would prevent you from rooting and ramming.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.000]   OK.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.200]   So it's up to the vendor to do the bootloader.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.840]   Now, I don't know if Google provides a reference bootloader.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   I bet you they do.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.800]   That would be pretty common.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.520]   So what I'm not sure then is if the security flaw in Google's
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   bootloader is in other bootloaders as well.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.440]   That's an interesting question.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:47.160]   So it sounds like Google is doing what Samsung used to do,
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:53.480]   which is locking down their pixels.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.960]   Yeah, it seems to remember hearing about the lockdown,
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.440]   Samsung devices, which is why Motorola was really
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.160]   popular amongst the hacker community,
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.840]   because their bootloader was pretty much wide open.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.640]   Google has always been agnostic on the idea of rooting your phone.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.240]   So with any operating system, there's an administrative user.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.080]   There's a super user in the Unix world that's called Root
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.280]   sometimes.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.040]   That Root user has all permissions.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.080]   They can erase anything.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.000]   They can do anything.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.160]   It's for security reasons.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.400]   You don't usually operate as Root user.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.080]   And in some situations, you're never given a Root user.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.480]   On both Windows and-- actually, Windows, I think,
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.160]   administrative users are Root users.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.760]   I'm not sure, but I think, yeah, you do have full access.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.400]   On Macintosh, you have to explicitly give somebody
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.440]   those permissions.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.760]   On Linux, you very rarely will use the Root.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.120]   And by the way, Android is Linux.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.880]   You'll rarely use the Root account,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.320]   except for special things.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.800]   So Google's always been agnostic, saying, well, if the vendor wants
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.600]   to allow Root, we're fine with that.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.240]   Android doesn't have an opinion on that.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.000]   But for security reasons, it sounds like that may be changing.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.320]   Jason, did you guys talk about that at all yesterday?
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.000]   All about Android's the authority on this.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.840]   Absolutely.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.280]   Anyway.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.040]   I think I know what my Wednesday TV view on will be.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.960]   Yeah, I'm going to watch it.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.040]   And then I'm going to go home.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.600]   And I'm going to-- I think I'll put it on there.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.960]   Oh, they didn't cover that.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.680]   I think I'll put it on-- you know what?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.120]   Now that you know, the bootloader has a security flaw
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.320]   in Android 12.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.000]   Maybe you should get off of Android 12
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and get off of Android 12.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Yeah, I'm like, yeah.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   I feel like--
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.760]   I don't like being the first to do this,
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.280]   but I'm also like, oh, well.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.320]   I just said in the RSC that I was just
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.480]   going to wait on it to happen.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.040]   I wasn't going to force the update, but geez.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.280]   Well, patching.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.040]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.920]   I don't think Google has said emergency emergency.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.960]   Let me-- I have to look more at this.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.240]   Well, the person has to have physical access
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.680]   to your device in the case of--
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.200]   Yes.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   So, OK.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.840]   Yes.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.840]   So that is a big deal.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.240]   Good point.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.320]   I always forget to find where the UI--
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.680]   I check on my--
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   see if there's a new version, if it'll download for me.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.720]   About phone, something like that.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.480]   I think there's a phone.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.040]   I'm there.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.520]   And system update at the very bottom.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.080]   Nope, not there for me.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.480]   This is the tweet from a flawed world
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.440]   warning to AOSP developers on 6th generation pixels,
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.960]   aka the Pixel 6.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.680]   Ensure you flash Android 13 to both slots,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.960]   because if you're A-- there's a-- there's
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.800]   the one that you use, and then there's kind of a backup--
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.920]   in case something goes wrong with the first ROM.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.000]   If the A13 fails to boot and falls back to the A12 boot
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.440]   loader, your phone will be permabrized.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.720]   Son of a mother.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.640]   Now, I presume the official update will automatically do
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.240]   that, put Android 13 in both slots.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.440]   But wow.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.800]   It's permabrized, a formal word.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.240]   It's not in websters, but it is certainly something--
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.880]   No, I've never heard that, but that is really accurate.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.160]   It's a good name, permabrized.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.680]   It's extra-bricked, just like you could brick it.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.200]   I think we had to make up permabrized,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.000]   because initially, brick was brick, right?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.520]   If something's-- if something's brick, it's a brick.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.160]   You can't restore it.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.080]   Do anything with it.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.720]   But I think they're soft-breaking.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.200]   So he really want to underscore.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   This is a permanent--
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.840]   The permanent nature of this.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.480]   This is a permabrick.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.560]   Yeah, I guess that soft-breaking makes sense,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.840]   thinking that to the old Kindle Fire days,
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   you could pretty much beat those things up,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.280]   but still figure out a way to bring them
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.920]   out to life as long as you could connect to them physically
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.000]   with the cable.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.800]   So yeah, I guess permabrick is--
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.600]   you're done.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.520]   Now--
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.320]   You're done, son.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.800]   Just wait and see what the rumors and others come up with.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.920]   So they were able to get around Samsung's triangle blocking.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.440]   Mr. Jarvis, I'm sorry.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.560]   It's not about phones.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.000]   I found it.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   System.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.120]   System scroll down.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.720]   I always have to go to four different places.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.880]   I'm always like, is it the phone?
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.240]   No.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.160]   Is it the OS?
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.720]   No.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.120]   Is it-- yeah.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.160]   Honestly, I usually just type in the little-sauce feature.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.600]   I just type in right there.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.640]   Can you ask Google?
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.120]   Can you be like, hey, G?
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:30.920]   Can I update--
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.840]   Is I just put in--
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.320]   30?
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.800]   I just put in UP, and it already brought up updates.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.520]   Oh, fast.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.960]   And is it there?
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.280]   Well, you know what?
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.480]   I didn't check, but--
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.320]   Well--
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.080]   If I want to check system updates, right?
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.120]   My first thing I'm going to do is--
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.560]   I'm going to do some dog menus.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.960]   I'm going to go home and try.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   Yeah, Mary Jo Foley, who has a Pixel 6 XL,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.600]   said she hadn't been offered it as of this.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.920]   Mine has not been offered.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.960]   I just checked.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.920]   What do we have to do, make a Google podcast together?
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.400]   Gee, school.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.360]   You'll get it?
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.360]   Just be patient.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.200]   Just so much.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.040]   You'll have to burn the appropriate dessert
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:20.220]   in call of the spirit of anti-v
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.240]   world, who works.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.880]   Oops.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.040]   So don't just let Google do it.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   Let go and let Google--
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.800]   Google knows best.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.240]   Google knows best.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.280]   Google has 310 results--
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.120]   To do so.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.480]   --coming up for the words perma-bricked.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.680]   So there are--
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.000]   To Rick Kahn.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.320]   Rick Kahn's doing the research.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.600]   I often think of--
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.880]   our IRC chat is kind of our research assistance.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.800]   I think more than our research assistance,
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.960]   they're really the people keeping us honest.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.920]   OK, that too.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.960]   That's well said and well said.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.120]   I might point out that a number of those results
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:02.320]   are for something you can buy called perma-brick for your walls.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.560]   That's a different kind of perma-brick.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.480]   OK, so there is, in fact--
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   Stick walls?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.880]   Did I just see a bullet back up?
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.960]   I did see a bullet stick walls.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.600]   That's so people can't--
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.880]   high security facilities can't drive through it.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.440]   And yeah, they're crash resistant.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.800]   Next to was Trump's wall.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.680]   The Hurricane fence?
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.160]   No, but look, there's perma-fence, perma-sound, perma-wall.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.000]   I'm only getting computer results.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.040]   I got 976 results.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.840]   Because Google knows you, geek.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.440]   That's interesting that I got when I searched for perma-brick.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.040]   All of my related searches are like, make boot image.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.800]   The number one result for me was classic brick walls.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.160]   Perma-brick from permacastwalls.com.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.440]   Wait a minute, here's Perma-tint, the leader
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.640]   in brick staining products.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.600]   Ah, but here we go, perma-brick on XDA forums.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.160]   Now slash verb.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   This is the real thing.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.480]   Describes what a phone or other device
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.640]   has been made totally useless in a form that
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.680]   is unrecoverable through normal methods.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.840]   Yeah, that's what I'm searching for.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.400]   Oh, well, I'm searching perma-brick.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.800]   So I'm searching it as a verb.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.200]   Oh, that's why.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.440]   I'm searching as a perma-brick.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   Search for the perma-brick.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.520]   Perma-brick is what you get after Brexit.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.600]   You are permanently British.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.440]   You are rich.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   Perma-brick.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   It's a perma-brick.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440]   All right, yes.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.080]   Now I get concrete for you and other exciting questions.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   Yes, exactly.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.680]   So the bill has been signed into law.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.920]   Inflation reduction acts, which really doesn't
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.440]   have any to do with inflation, but you know it's--
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.440]   It's a really name.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440]   It's a good name.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440]   If the other side could make us--
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   No, because I already have IRIS.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   You already have IRIS?
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.440]   IRAs.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   Oh, it is.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440]   It's IRAs.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.440]   IRMA accounts.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   What is the IRIS?
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   IRIS for public and army.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.560]   Joe Biden signed it into law yesterday.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.120]   Lots of things will be impacted.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:07.000]   The White House did get a battle list of electric vehicles that will be eligible this
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.400]   year for the clean vehicle credit, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:21.920]   The Ford F-series, that's the Lightning, Transit VAN, Jeep's, Lincoln's, Lucid's, Nissan's,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.800]   Rivians, Volvos.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.960]   Next year BMWs, Mercedes, Nissan's.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:34.400]   But EVs that have used up their tax credits shame on you, the 2022 Chevy Bolt, UV, the regular
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.440]   Bolt, the Hummer pickup, the Tesla models, 3S, X, and Y.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.360]   But it's a really weird market intervention here just because--
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.400]   Gee, we rushed and we got out EVs so we could sell to the public.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.640]   Oh, well, now you're kind of screwed.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.640]   There are all these rules though.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.000]   You have to have a certain amount of it that has to be made in the US or North America,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I guess.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Thanks, Manchin.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.200]   You have to assemble it in North America.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.720]   Yeah, there's lots of rules.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:05.320]   But I have mixed feelings about, you know, I'm all for battery electric vehicles.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.120]   And certainly government subsidies early on made it possible, but really those were
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.920]   luxury vehicles.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   Yep.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.960]   So the benefit went to rich people who might have bought these anyway.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.040]   I mean, like, what about the Prius?
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.000]   Every Uber driver or Lyft driver drove a Prius.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.360]   Yeah, but that's a hybrid.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.840]   That's not eligible for the--
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.320]   Okay, what about a leaf?
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.720]   Did hybrids, which get credits?
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   Maybe they did.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   I might be wrong.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.360]   Well, Leo, in this list, it lists only three models have a 2023.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.200]   Is that because that's when the new restrictions come in?
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   I'm confused.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.480]   No, I think it's just because these are the only-- I don't know.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   I don't know.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   I don't know.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   20 model year 20-- oh, it's just the model year.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.360]   These are early 2023 model years.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   That's all.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.880]   You know how the model year begins in like September.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.360]   So these are the ones that have been announced.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   And the leaf is in it.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.640]   What's the Volvo brand?
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.640]   The pull star?
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.640]   Is that what you're thinking of?
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   I'll say that.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.480]   I don't see no pull star because it's not assembled in North--
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.160]   It's not assembled in North America.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   Oh.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.360]   Is it assembled and sweated?
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.000]   Probably.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.880]   So would you rather have a drunk sweet assemble your vehicle?
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.560]   I don't think so.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.040]   No, I think those pull stars are actually pretty nice.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.720]   It's a Swedish brand headquartered outside Gotenberg.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.480]   Vehicle production takes place in China.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   Good good boy.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.800]   They're built in China.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.440]   I can pretty much guarantee you're not
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.920]   going to get a credit for a vehicle built in China.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.800]   Lots of other things in the IRA.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.680]   That's all I have to say about that.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.960]   Are these cars still starting out at like 30 grand?
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.440]   Because I do.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.720]   Much more than that.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.840]   The only one that's affordable is the Bolt, I think.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.360]   OK.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.960]   Elon wanted to make the model 335,000.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.680]   He's not got down below 45,000 as far as I know.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.440]   But a vehicle's just expensive, right?
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.640]   But they're a lot less expensive.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.080]   It's a whole cost.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.320]   Because the problem is the battery for 15 to 20,000 is still
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.800]   the serviceable car for--
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.600]   Yeah, the battery's a significant part of the cost.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.440]   That's why.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:32.800]   However, you save money, a lot of money on gasoline
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.360]   and maintenance and all that.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.080]   We got a Chevy Bolt close to 20 after the federal and state
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.000]   credits.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.640]   Oh, nice.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.920]   Yeah, that's a nice-- it's actually a really nice battery
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.040]   electric vehicle.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.400]   Good range.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.120]   Sure, a few of them have blown up.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   But that's--
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.800]   That's just the risk you have to taste, man.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.400]   Just keep the moment at salesmen.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.560]   Eric Duckman says he said--
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.800]   Yeah, electric.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   Looks nice to me.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.360]   They're nice.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.320]   He's a really nice--
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:01.880]   Yeah, I like them.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.600]   Nice.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.800]   There's also the ionics.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.720]   There's quite a few, a really nice bet.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.120]   And thanks to Elon and Tesla for making that market
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.000]   good and take off.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.320]   I think they really did make that.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.480]   And the Feds and their subsidies definitely helped.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.960]   But there are very many inexpensive BEVs, battery
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.520]   electric vehicles, because of that.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:25.600]   Would you get a Rivian?
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.240]   Yeah, they're cute.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.520]   We did a Sam and Bull Sam and our car guy did a review.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.040]   Car guy.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.680]   Comparing the lightning to the Rivian,
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.280]   and lightning's the Ford F-150.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.240]   The Rivian is this new R1T from a company called Rivian.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.000]   And he liked them both.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.320]   Ford's made a lot of trucks in their time, a lot of F-150s.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.000]   So he thinks a probably better truck
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.320]   for a little convenience reasons as much as anything else.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.840]   I think he liked the lightning.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.520]   But he can't get a--
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.000]   Can power a damn house with that thing.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.080]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.880]   In theory, any car, any electric vehicle can.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.520]   You need an inverter for the battery.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.920]   The lightning comes with it built in,
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.920]   but you can always get an inverter for your battery
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.480]   and plug your electric vehicle and power your house.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.160]   In fact, my house is powered by two recycled Tesla batteries.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.640]   Thanks.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.000]   The cheapest electric vehicles out there
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.440]   are indeed the Chevy Bolt.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.400]   I keep wanting to say it.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.920]   I'm like not Volkswagen.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.120]   That's 26.5.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.240]   And then the Leaf is 28.9.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   And then we get into the 30--
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.800]   The Leaf is still qualified.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.800]   The only reason the Chevy's Bolt is modest
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.000]   is because they sold more than 200,000 of them.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.360]   I mean, that's the same thing for the Tesla.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.440]   They've sold enough that they're no longer subsidized.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.680]   And when you get into these mid-range ones,
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.920]   they're kind of terrible.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.760]   Like the Mini Cooper for 30,000, it only goes 114 miles.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.680]   That's its range.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.880]   Yeah, that's what Lisa tries.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.360]   And then the Mazda is 100.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.320]   Yeah, these kind of suck.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.200]   Pepper.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.120]   Pepper.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.640]   She loves it, but we have a longer range vehicle, obviously,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.840]   because you could barely get to the airport and back.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.920]   So it's not ideal.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.560]   What do you find if you're--
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.400]   Have you gone on overnight trips to things
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.080]   where you've got to find someplace to charge?
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.640]   No problem.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.480]   We went down to Carmel.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.240]   There's chargers everywhere.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.080]   There is an issue.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.560]   And I just saw an article about it.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.040]   There is an issue with--
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   Unfortunately, a lot of the electric chargers
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.640]   are unmonitored.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.240]   You know, not like a gas station where there's
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.600]   somebody there.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.440]   And so they--
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.160]   Rumpy and but there.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.720]   Yeah, they're grumpy, but they're there.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   And there are a lot of gas vehicle drivers
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.360]   who don't like electric, who will--
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.520]   these get vandalized and damaged frequently.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.680]   And so it's a little disappointing.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.840]   You've got a map.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.040]   It says there's a charger here.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.560]   You get there and they're out of commission,
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.880]   because somebody's torn them off or something.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.240]   But there are everywhere.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.160]   We went to Carmel.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.360]   We found a charge point.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.760]   I had to leave the car there overnight.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.000]   It wasn't a fast charger.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.160]   But it's fine.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.360]   And it parked it there, charged.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.720]   How far away was it from the hotel?
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.000]   A couple of blocks.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.360]   Many hotels now have a--
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   I'll have a destination.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   All right, here's another question for you.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   Where's the other question for you?
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   Sorry.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.560]   Go ahead.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.240]   No, I was going to say we were in Portland,
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.840]   and we could destination charge up at the hotel.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.800]   At the hotel?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.880]   So Newark Airport Parking has slots.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.840]   And let's say you're going away for a week.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.360]   Yes.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.600]   You parked the problem.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.920]   No.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.840]   You can't.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.920]   You're monopolizing it for a week, right?
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   They'll charge you.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.160]   No.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.520]   So there was an Austin--
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.360]   there was a parking ride.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.640]   It wasn't a parking ride, but whatever.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.520]   They had those slots.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.880]   And you just booked those slots,
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.640]   and you could stay there for the whole time.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.240]   That's nice.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.760]   But the ones in the parking lot and the long-term
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.840]   parking at the airports--
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.680]   I don't know what you're supposed to do.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.720]   Maybe it's for people on an overnight trip.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   I don't get it.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.880]   Because yeah, if you're gone a week,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.000]   you're going to leave it plugged in for a week,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   or does your wife come on plug it?
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Are you charged for the time it's plugged in?
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.920]   Or are you charged for electricity that you don't?
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.280]   Most of those, they charge you while you're
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.080]   charging for electricity, then you get like an hour grace
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.560]   period, and then they start charging you for parking there.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   Well, wow.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.240]   Which is not ideal.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.520]   Well, maybe they just charge you at the normal overnight
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.040]   right there, though.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.840]   Yeah, I don't really look into Oakland Airport has them.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.080]   The nice thing is they're right by the terminal.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.200]   So you could just whiz in, pull in, charge it.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   But I think it's not right to do that.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.600]   By the way, the credit also--
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.000]   Not right.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.280]   I think it's not right.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.520]   The credit also applies to used battery electric vehicles.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.280]   So that's going to be interesting.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.920]   That's going to jumpstart that market, so to speak.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.360]   And I think that's good.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.120]   I think that's good.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.800]   All right.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.240]   I think we've said enough about the I-R--
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.200]   Actually, there's lots more to say, but I think that's the--
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.840]   Oh, do you want to take--
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.240]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.000]   Go ahead.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.880]   I'm super excited because it offers residential tax breaks
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.480]   for residential upgrades for things like demand response.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.040]   And I'm really hopeful we'll see, one, the adoption
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.800]   of more heat pumps and things like that.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.520]   But also--
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.120]   Yes.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.240]   Much more intelligence being put into the end nodes of the grid
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.920]   so we can start coordinating between those two better.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.160]   So I was excited about that.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.840]   80 billion in rebates as much as $14,000 in money
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.280]   back helping households pay for green energy upgrades,
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.960]   including efficient heat pumps.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.480]   You can get $8,000 back per hassle, which is great.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.080]   I've been wanting to replace my furnaces with a heat pump.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.400]   Much more efficient, right, Stacey?
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.120]   So much more efficient.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   And you don't have heating oil deliveries,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.160]   and that's disgusting anyway.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.080]   I will tell you, though, you're going to have a fee for decommissioning
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.520]   your heating oil tank if you formally decommission it.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.280]   We have gas furnaces, natural gas furnaces.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:02.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.480]   So that won't be sufficient.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.560]   Well, then your fuel.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.840]   Electric water heaters, you can get money for that
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.360]   if you have a gas heater and electric cooktops.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.960]   We've been wanting to buy an induction.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.200]   Get conduction, not conduction.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Induction.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:15.720]   Induction.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.320]   I've had it now for--
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.720]   Do you love it?
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.560]   I love it.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.160]   I really do.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.560]   I mean, last year, right?
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.360]   Yeah, well, was it last year, early this year, January?
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.280]   I don't know.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.880]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.360]   Like, yes, I had to relearn how to cook rice on it,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.040]   but that's OK.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.000]   You have to do that for every new stove.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.360]   You just clean it like a minute after.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.880]   It doesn't get hot.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.440]   And the pots are for your heating oil.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.320]   I don't know about that.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.920]   If you've got stainless steel, I mean,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.200]   you do have to replace all your pots.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.320]   It's expensive.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.760]   But it just-- it's a great cooking experience.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.600]   And it's so exact.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.320]   Oh, I love it.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.200]   I love it so much.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   I can't wait.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.280]   Can I recommend on line 97 Hank Green
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.600]   did a really, really good explainer of the IRA?
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.720]   Oh, thank you, Hank Green.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.360]   So should we watch the whole thing?
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.040]   No, you could just watch a minute of it.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.560]   I don't think we can watch any of it.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.680]   This one will get taken down by Hank Green.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.280]   I can share--
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.320]   there was a blooming--
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   Famous last words.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.160]   A lovely graphic.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:30.400]   We had-- I put eight seconds of Colbert.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.040]   Was it Colbert?
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.560]   Who was it?
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.400]   No, it was-- yeah, it was Colbert and Twit.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:35.880]   And--
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.360]   --severeign.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:37.880]   Pardon me?
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.640]   --said the severance.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.160]   Was it severance?
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.520]   It was a cleop of his parody of severance.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.240]   Put this much in it.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.280]   And I chickened out at the end because Lisa said,
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.680]   you know, yeah, we only have maybe 5,000 to 7,000 downloads
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   of the show on YouTube.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.800]   But we're right on the edge of deliverables.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.880]   And if we lose those 7,000, we might have to do make goods
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.200]   for every ad on Twitch.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   Oh, shit.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.040]   There should be a lot of money.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.480]   And so I chickened out, even though I know I have every right
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.040]   to do it.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:10.880]   It was commentary.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.240]   It was transformational.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.800]   It promoted his show.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.840]   It didn't cost him--
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.160]   I mean, in every respect, it was, of course, perfectly
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.720]   OK, it was news coverage.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.400]   But I chickened out.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.800]   So I'm not playing No Hank Green.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.600]   I appreciate the--
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.480]   Hey, Hank, so nice.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.760]   Is that up to each creator as to whether or not
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.840]   they go after you?
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.160]   Or is that YouTube now?
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:32.600]   No, no.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.320]   It's the creators you have to--
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.800]   Other people can--
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.880]   Other people, though, can do it on their behalf, can't they?
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.280]   And the content ID, you know, Hank Green--
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.640]   I don't know if Hank Green uses content ID.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.840]   He might--
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.440]   I don't know.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.240]   Do you know he doesn't?
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.080]   I want to Twitter.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.200]   I want to go out of Twitter and ask him.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.720]   Ask him, Hank.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.600]   Can we have permission to show the biggest climate bill
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.200]   of your life, but what does it do?
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   No, because we're going to make our own dang content.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.080]   Ha, ha.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:00.680]   We're not going to--
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.520]   But our content isn't actually researched.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.440]   Like, I haven't finished reading the IRA,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.960]   even though I am reading it.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.160]   Homeowners can receive a 30% credit
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.720]   for installing solar panels.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.520]   There will be substantial tax credits
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.600]   to transition to clean energy.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.840]   We mentioned electric vehicles.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.760]   It'll make it easy for families to actually make
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.480]   these clean energy changes.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.080]   Families who use funding from the bill
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.000]   to switch to greener technology could save money, as well,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.880]   on energy costs, up to--
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.040]   according to rewiring America, $1,840 a year.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.000]   So there you go.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.160]   You're going to get faster tax refunds
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.720]   because the IRS is going to hire new agents.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.600]   Perscription medication.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.080]   We know about that.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.960]   For seniors only, the rest of you, sorry.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.760]   But Medicare is going to get to negotiate drug prices, which
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.000]   has been a huge issue.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.400]   We did, I'm sure, talk about the insulin issue.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.040]   Lower prices and other items may be eventually.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.440]   Economists say it's unlikely the Inflation Reduction Act
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.520]   will reduce inflation, at least anytime soon.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:15.240]   Maybe 0.1 percentage points in about five years,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.040]   according to Wharton.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.480]   It was still brilliant positioning.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.040]   It was a very good name.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   But a lot of things that I think it's really--
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.040]   it's stuff that is forward thinking, especially
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.120]   with climate change breathing down our necks.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.160]   I think it's good.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.320]   Hank was quite enthusiastic.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.520]   About us playing it?
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.800]   Quite-- no, yes, it answered yet.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.280]   He was quite enthusiastic about the--
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.240]   he was arguing that this is a big deal, folks.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.160]   It really is the biggest environmental we've had.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.640]   It's really going to make an impact.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.680]   People have been working really hard.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.640]   Finally, we see a little daylight.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.640]   That's the wrong word.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.840]   See, we didn't have to play it.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.280]   Just summarize it.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.360]   You got my interpretation.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.880]   Yeah, hey, summarize it.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.640]   Can you do an interpretive dance to the--
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.280]   tell you what, we'll save that for later.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.760]   We'll save that for us.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.760]   What?
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.600]   What?
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.680]   You'll find out, Steve.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:11.520]   You'll find out in TikTok Corner.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.760]   Hey, hey, hey, you're going to thank me.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   I guarantee you, you're going to thank me.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.560]   All right, all right.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   I showed it a brought to you by--
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.160]   So much mattress Mac right there.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.520]   Hey, it's better than pillow Mike.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.600]   Oh, we know it's not--
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.280]   no, it's the-- who is the guy at the men's warehouse?
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.520]   You're going to like the way you feel.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.800]   Mattress Mike.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.960]   Who's Mattress Mike?
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   Is that a low-hole--
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.200]   No, he's the one who's mattress Mac.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.360]   He's a Houston furniture salesman.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.720]   Houston.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.840]   But yeah, I don't-- George Zimmerman,
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.680]   was that his name?
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   The men's warehouse dude?
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.180]   Yes.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.880]   Yeah, and then he got fired for some reason.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.960]   They didn't like the way he did.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.360]   They pushed him out.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.400]   You're going to hate the way I run this company.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.280]   By the way, mattress Mac--
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.440]   But I'll let him tell you this story.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.120]   Well, very disappointing game.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.480]   I'm heartbroken that our great customers who bought mattresses
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.720]   and power furniture didn't get their money back.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.600]   I thought the bingles are going to win all the way up
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.720]   to the very end.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.440]   He lost $5 million on the Super Bowl.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.920]   Yeah, it's a heartbroken for our customers
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.200]   since the night he didn't win.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.960]   Why is he heartbroken for the customers?
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.760]   He's the one who lost $5 million.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.520]   Because they were going to get their stuff for free?
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.080]   Popular Houstonian and furniture guru Jim Mattress Mac
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.360]   McEnvail is now at a large amount of cash
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:48.280]   after he been on the losing team for Super Bowl 56.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.240]   And our customers are the losers because we're
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.120]   going to raise prices on everything.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.160]   Oh, no, no, Mattress Mac.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.600]   No, he's a good dude.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   He's a good man.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.880]   Is this the guy who has people enduring the floods?
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:00.480]   Yes.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:01.840]   Oh, great.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.560]   This man trusts--
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.400]   He also has beautiful--
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.840]   well, I'll let him tell you the story.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.120]   Beautiful bedroom furniture at reasonable prices.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   You look all over Houston.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.440]   If you grew up in Houston for the 1980s until now,
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.040]   you're going to know who gallery furniture is.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.120]   Is that him right there?
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.640]   He will save you.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   I'll bet you're back.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   That's his catch line.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   I'm going to do his catch line.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.160]   We'll save you money.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.120]   You're going to know that's mattress.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.200]   I like his tight pants.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.200]   Yes.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.280]   There's a little dated.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.720]   You're going to know that's Mattress Mac.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.320]   If your mattress is older than 10 years old,
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.920]   if you live in Houston, you're a hundred percent
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.160]   of who Mattress Mac is.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.680]   I can't believe--
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.680]   Oh my god.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   That's awesome.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.320]   Now we're going to get taken down by Mattress Mac.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.400]   That's exactly the idea.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   You don't trust--
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:44.880]   Hey, creep.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.240]   You trust Mattress Mac.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.880]   No, Mattress-- like, he used to visit schools
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.400]   for the dare program.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:53.880]   Oh.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.160]   You can tell when I grew up.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.640]   But like, he--
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.200]   But hey, did you do drugs?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.760]   Genuinely, like, community-oriented, nice dude.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.640]   You just said no, right?
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.400]   You didn't do drugs?
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   Yes.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.560]   I-- what?
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.080]   What?
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.640]   No.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.880]   Isn't that what dare was all about?
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.640]   Dare not to do drugs?
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.840]   That was what dare was all about.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:15.000]   Dare to-- yeah.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.040]   Dare to just say no.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.280]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.400]   I was you all the fingers, kids.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.640]   You probably didn't know about yet.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.520]   But now you do.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.400]   What happened to the war on drugs?
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:23.920]   That is true.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.880]   That's how I learned about a lot of drugs
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.960]   when I was like in fourth grade.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.960]   Did we just lose the war on drugs and give up?
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.880]   Do we just walk away?
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.800]   Like the war on COVID.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.040]   Wasn't that like Nancy Reagan's thing?
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.160]   She just-- I thought that was one of great things.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.680]   I say no.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.560]   Wow.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.000]   Chuck Norris did some ads for Gallery furniture in 1992.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.560]   How about this?
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.760]   Am I encouraged in San Francisco?
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.160]   There's a new book out about Crazy Eddy.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:51.720]   Oh.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   Crazy Eddy!
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.320]   So Bachelors back was like Crazy Eddy or Crazy Eddy.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.240]   Or we had Top of the Hill Daily City.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.080]   We had-- what was his name?
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.880]   Oh.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   I guess every region probably has their Huxter
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.760]   that buys so much ad time on radio and TV that he's a celebrity.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.360]   Well, now you probably don't have it
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.000]   because we don't have local TV.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.360]   Yeah, it changes, doesn't it?
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.000]   It's streaming.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.160]   You know, instead of what we have,
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.440]   you know what's driving me absolutely up the wall?
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.760]   Now I have to mute the TV at every break on MSNBC,
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.640]   not to see the Looney lady.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:32.000]   Putting this weird deodorant in your butt cheeks.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   What?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:33.480]   What?
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.720]   Oh, she's just-- she just--
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.120]   I think what's happening is they're buying tons of time
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.880]   on Verizon, not on MSNBC.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.920]   Yeah, I think it's in New Jersey, Ed, because I don't think--
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.280]   I think I'd remember that if I'd seen it.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.640]   Oh, it's disgusting.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.320]   It's completely-- she's trying to convince women
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.160]   they all smell bad and they should put this stuff
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.440]   in their butt cheeks.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.440]   Wow.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.040]   It's like butt deodorant.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   Hold on.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.680]   I don't want to Google this, but--
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.520]   No, no, stop.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.320]   Right now, don't.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.680]   No, please.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.200]   Looney.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:03.920]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.560]   Yes, if you--
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.080]   Yeah, no.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.200]   --that Looney stops odor naturally.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   Oh, my God.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.200]   Below the waist deodorant.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.000]   Oh, may I escape?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.520]   You know all the waist odor.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.040]   You're also offers one.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.960]   Oh, my God.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.360]   She's-- the commercial is made like she's doing it just
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.680]   to a phone because it's a vertical.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.200]   Then she shows you the little dabbadoo, a little dabbled
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.280]   dewia, and your butt cheeks.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   Oh, my God.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   Oh, where they can add a dog spot?
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.520]   If you need a better car, go see Cal.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.040]   You're a strong choice, I'm sorry.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.640]   OK, but I want you to know there's
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.480]   another one called Sweet Cheeks.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.240]   Ah, that's about cheddar needs.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.720]   Ah.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.600]   I tried.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.320]   I really tried.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.160]   Folks, you know I tried.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:49.760]   Did you watch--
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.600]   Did you run our ad yet?
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.680]   Did you watch the end of Better Call Saul?
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.320]   Yesterday, Monday.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.800]   Well, I didn't watch the beginning.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   What?
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   Great show.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.720]   Oh, because I was-- you got to commit, and I didn't commit,
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.520]   and so it was always too late to commit.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.040]   It's not too late.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.120]   It's going to-- you know, you can watch all.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.040]   So let's see.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:08.960]   Is Stacy a gas--
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.460]   Gas.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.720]   --for gagging herself or y'all?
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.240]   6 years of breaking bad, and then in 8 years
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.680]   of Better Call Saul, 15 years making this Heisenberg
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.400]   universe.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:21.900]   Yeah, no--
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:22.920]   This is prequel.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.960]   So this is all before?
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:24.760]   No, no, no, no.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.280]   It's both.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.240]   It's a prequel and a postquel.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.080]   Oh, I see.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:28.280]   OK.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.600]   It's very confusing.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.440]   But the reason I thought about this
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.000]   is because he became famous for his ads
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.360]   on local Albuquerque TV for Saul Goodman.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.000]   He's a lawyer.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.320]   Evicciently, yes.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:44.800]   Fictionally.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   Well, and they were completely a parody
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.880]   of all these other ads.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.200]   They were hysterical.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.720]   Anyway, it's over now.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.600]   Beautiful, beautiful show.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.760]   So our show today brought to you by SecureWorks.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.560]   Let me talk about SecureWorks a little bit.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:06.960]   If you think about it, the biggest risk to your company
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.160]   is not knocking on your door.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:13.360]   It's the prowler who's already inside,
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.720]   like a intruder in your home who's sneaking around,
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.320]   eating your food, watching your Netflix, sleeping
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.560]   in the basement.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.560]   Wouldn't that be the worst to have an intruder
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.120]   in your IT infrastructure?
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.880]   Think of the damage they could do.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.960]   How many passwords they could compromise?
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.920]   The documents they could steal on many systems.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.120]   They could damage or degrade.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:38.040]   Threat actors often hide in plain sight in IT systems.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.720]   And on average, more than 200 days
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.920]   before they're detected.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   Six months before they're detected.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.000]   And I can tell you story after story.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.520]   Remember the hacker who got into the Sony Pictures Entertainment
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.640]   was there from May through December before Sony noticed?
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.840]   Meantime, they have to infiltrate all the movies,
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.680]   the contracts, and then they trigger ransomware
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.600]   as just a kind of a final farewell.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   What happens when stopping at the endpoint
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.760]   is stopping your ability to properly defend your infrastructure?
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.360]   Then you need SecureWorks.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:17.280]   And they're Tages Extended Detection and Response, XDR.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:21.040]   It's great to have a perimeter defense.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.160]   But when people get in and they will get in, you need to have more.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.840]   You need a comprehensive and effective security posture
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.280]   with one unified singular point of view,
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:35.360]   giving you visibility throughout your entire stack.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.800]   Tages XDR is extensible.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.160]   It follows data moving beyond the perimeter.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.680]   It helps organizations unify prevention detection and response.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.200]   And completely mitigates this issue of siloed security solutions,
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.880]   probably what you have right now.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.240]   You've got endpoints, you've got perimeters,
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.040]   you've got maybe you're going through email protection.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.400]   But that leaves coverage gaps.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.440]   And of course, what's going to happen?
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.200]   Bad guys are going to take advantage of them.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.640]   By organizing multiple point solutions
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.680]   and creating one unified and clear picture of your infrastructure,
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.000]   Tages XDR helps teams prevent threats effectively,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.920]   detects them rapidly.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:13.200]   And most importantly, respond appropriately quickly.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.880]   SecureWorks meets customers where they are with managed XDR.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.840]   A lot of you might have a big IT team,
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.520]   and you can manage it yourself.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.880]   But many of us are too small to do that.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.200]   SecureWorks offers a SaaS solution that can leverage
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.360]   their own in-house experts 24/7, 365 days a year.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.240]   So they can help you.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.400]   They can investigate and respond to threats on your behalf,
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.320]   which cuts 12 times, decreases operational burden,
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.400]   produces your cost.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.640]   So if you've got a big team, fine.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.800]   You can manage XDR by yourself, but there is also
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.480]   a managed XDR solution for you.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.160]   And since most companies have a shortage of security talent,
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.480]   this is something you'll also want to look at.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.720]   Let me give you a number.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.760]   Even if you're not a SecureWorks customer,
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.880]   write this down, put it on a post-it note.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.400]   1-800-breached.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.240]   See is it remember, right?
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.760]   1-800-BREAC-HED-breached.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   If you're a SecureWorks customer, even if you're not,
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.200]   you can get fast emergency response with chat,
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.720]   including incident commanders who will find the root cause
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.080]   while preparing you for future threats.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.560]   They leap into action.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   It's like 911 for advanced persistent threats.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   When your organization experiences a breach or a cyber attack,
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.960]   time is of the essence.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.760]   You can't fuss around.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.600]   What do we do?
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.440]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.280]   Where are they?
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.120]   Who knows?
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:33.960]   What are we going to--
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.320]   Every minute counts, call 1-800-breached.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.760]   And SecureWorks Emergency Incident Response Team
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.000]   will provide you with immediate assistance
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.800]   responding to and remediating a cyber incident or data breach.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.760]   And they can do it any time of the day or night,
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.680]   any day of the year.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.520]   They're there for you.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.680]   1-800-breached.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.560]   SecureWorks, they offer a purpose-built XDR solution
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.160]   designed to answer today's evolving security challenges.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.040]   Optimized by machine learning, sure.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.320]   But-- and yes, deep detection capabilities--
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.680]   but refined through human intelligence and insights
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.560]   earned over decades of experience.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.800]   Now, that's a perfect marriage.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.000]   That's a perfect marriage.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.840]   The software is smart.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.840]   It's got deep detection capabilities,
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.880]   but you've also got these experts who've got intuition,
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.440]   who've got knowledge, who know what to do to help you.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.440]   They're there for you.
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.000]   Gartner, Forrester, and IDC, all three
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.120]   have declared SecureWorks a leader in security operations.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.080]   SecureWorks empowers organizations
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   with a collaborative and innovative security
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   solutions required to achieve strong security
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.600]   in an evolving digital world.

[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.440]   presents to your organization.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.080]   SecureWorks has case studies.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.400]   They've got reports from their counter threat union.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.800]   This is what's cool about SecureWorks,
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.400]   that all these experts, and they're
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.840]   working all the time to find out what's going on,
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:03.000]   what are the newest threats, and then they
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.520]   reported the counter threat unit.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.760]   And I think this is so useful.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.040]   Visit secureworks.com/twit.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.520]   You can get right now a free trial of Tages XDR,

[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.600]   Amazon and Nielsen, this is interesting,
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.440]   have made a deal to get ratings for Thursday Night Football.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:50.360]   Amazon this year will own NFL's Thursday Night Football.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.920]   But traditionally, streamers do not have ratings, right?
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.520]   In fact, this came up on Mac Break Weekly last week
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.360]   because Ben Stiller, who created Severance,
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:08.520]   and two of the stars of another Apple TV show,
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.400]   its most popular, Ted Lasso, all said,
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:15.720]   we have no idea if anybody's watching.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   I find this--
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.560]   I mean, I know it doesn't.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.320]   There's not a third party audience.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.320]   There's no auditing--
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.960]   It's not IP addresses.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.760]   Oh, Apple knows.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   But that's a point.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.880]   They're not telling anybody.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:28.720]   It's probably--
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:31.960]   In this case, Amazon is the one whose asking for ratings.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.760]   When Amazon knows.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.920]   Amazon may want to be audited, but Amazon knows exactly how many--
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.520]   Well, no, because there's also over-the-air stations.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.280]   It's also viewed in bars and restaurants.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.440]   It's not just streamed.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.760]   So it's public place, too.
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.400]   It's all--
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.400]   So--
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.680]   But this is a big deal because, historically--
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.880]   and we know this-- Apple, Amazon, Microsoft--
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.440]   they don't want to-- even Netflix, they never say numbers.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:03.840]   No.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.080]   They will never say numbers.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:05.760]   They don't want--
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.080]   Right.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.240]   For whatever reason.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:07.960]   Jeff, for this case--
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.400]   But in this case, Amazon is the one asking for it,
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.440]   doing the deal.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.360]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.560]   Amazon could just reveal their number.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.400]   I think this is pressure from the advertisers
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.360]   would be my guess.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.120]   Having--
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.320]   But didn't Nielsen have pretty much a solid name?
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.080]   Yeah, Nielsen's been doing TV measurements since,
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.920]   for time and more.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.120]   There's two companies that do TV.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.920]   And you're right.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.200]   There's been some kind of scandals around that.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.600]   But the weird thing about Nielsen is it's sampling.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.520]   Right.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.600]   So they do people meters.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.480]   Yeah, they have people meters and that kind of stuff.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.120]   So they only-- this is the problem with small niche things
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.600]   is the odds that the one person who's sampling in Montana
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.640]   is watching your show, speaking for all of Montana
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.040]   and the statistics, are pretty low in a time of abundant choice.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.360]   Nielsen said this will be the first time they'll
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.520]   be doing measurements on both a streaming service
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.840]   and a live streaming program.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.040]   I guess--
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.160]   You just said the same thing.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.640]   Yeah, but that's what I'm reading.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.080]   This is-- that crunch Nielsen said this will be the first time
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.280]   the firm will include a streaming service
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.840]   and its live streaming program in its national TV measurement
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.280]   service.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.560]   I guess it's the first time they've ever done for streaming.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.160]   So is Thursday night-- I guess-- tell me, Chatteram.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.920]   Is Thursday night football going to be on TV as well?
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.160]   Or is it just on Amazon?
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.120]   It used to only be--
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.720]   Last year it was on NFL Network.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.400]   It used to only be on NFL Network exclusively.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.040]   It wasn't something that ESPN would pick up.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.800]   It was just the NFL Network.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.760]   And then they split it.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.120]   And they were able to be available on prime video
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.080]   and NFL Network.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.680]   I don't think NFL's got it anymore.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.360]   I think it's just Amazon.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.240]   That's what it reads.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.400]   Because remember Amazon--
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.440]   did this big deal they got--
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.480]   Al Michaels to come over from broadcast.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.560]   Kurt-- Kurt-- Herb Street, I believe.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.280]   And then there was a big--
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.720]   who's going to be number two with Al Michaels
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.320]   and Al had a lot of say in it because he didn't want
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.760]   to work with the doofers.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.280]   I guess Herb was good--
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.120]   Kurt-- Herb Street.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.200]   Kurt-- Herb Street.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.480]   Or Herb Kirk Street.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.040]   Whoever was-- just exactly who Al wanted.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.760]   Out of home viewing refers to bars, restaurants, and hotels.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.320]   Anyway, it's interesting.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.080]   You're right, Jeff.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.320]   I mean, that was my thought as well.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.600]   Doesn't Amazon already know exactly?
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.760]   And there is no broadcast TV.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.600]   So for some reason-- oh, OK, Nielsen's streaming TV charts
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.800]   now include Apple TV plus for the first time.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.880]   OK, so that started last in October of last year.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.920]   So to answer your earlier question,
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.240]   I'm trying to look up everything behind a paywall.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.920]   But there were accusations that Nielsen was under reporting
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.840]   viewership numbers, which is always the complaint.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.320]   Yeah, that works.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.360]   That can't possibly be that low.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.720]   I know more people were watching.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   Which probably means Nielsen was accurate.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.600]   Well, I mean, but if no one believed it, why would they trust
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.160]   in years later, especially if they were getting it wrong?
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.200]   And you're right, it's the only name in town, I guess.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.040]   That's the only reason they were trusted.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.480]   Yeah, well, they've been up for sale more.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.960]   I was on the original committee for the Audit Bureau
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.480]   of Circulations--
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.080]   for magazines.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.520]   --for magazines.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.360]   And they thought that advertisers would want an audit
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.840]   of the total audience of a magazine, which, of course,
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.960]   they didn't, because no longer was it presumed that one person
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.280]   read the entire magazine that saw every ad.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.200]   So all he wanted was an audit of what--
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.200]   of their flake of ads that was served.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.320]   And for example, GM in the early days said--
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.040]   very early days on the web said, you ain't serving our ads.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.600]   We're serving our ads ourselves, so we know what gets served.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.920]   Here's what Amazon said.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.160]   Our collaboration with Nielsen will
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.000]   allow us to provide advertisers with familiar campaign
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   measurements to make Apple the Apple comparison.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.560]   So this is exactly what I thought, which is advertisers
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.400]   are saying, yes, streamers, you tell us how many downloads,
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.840]   how many IP addresses.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   But we want to know the same--
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.880]   The third party.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.920]   We want to know those--
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.800]   yeah, first of all, trust the third party, right?
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.400]   Because we have the same problem in podcasting.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.680]   We want to trust the third party.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.680]   And we want those numbers to be the same kind of numbers
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.240]   we get from the networks--
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.840]   share in ratings and a dominant area of dominant influence
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.120]   and all that stuff.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.760]   But in a panel, podcasts could never show up.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.400]   Because the odds of a panel member
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.520]   having watched in the period listened.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.960]   This was a problem in tech TV because we were on cable
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.280]   and we got ratings.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:00.240]   But the number of people who watched--
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.600]   the number of people who were on a panel or had people meters,
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.080]   it's a statistical sample, right?
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.240]   So they only give them to, I don't know,
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.120]   how many 1,000 people or something.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.680]   And that represents millions of people's nationwide.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.320]   The problem is when a network audience is so low that one
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.320]   or two people represent the entire audience
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.200]   in that 1,000 per person panel.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.240]   If one of those people gets sick or goes to the bathroom
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.080]   or dies, your audience just got cut in half.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   So that's the problem when you're really small.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.000]   The ratings are terrible because it doesn't work.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.440]   The whole panel system doesn't work.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.080]   By the way, update here, Hank Green responds,
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.800]   "I think you should be good."
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.200]   "I'm not going on it. I think you should be good."
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.160]   "It doesn't even know."
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.200]   "There's not a yes or a no."
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:49.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.800]   "Try it and see," is what they say.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.000]   "I've got a trust."
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.680]   "I think you should be good."
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.080]   "I need a yes or a no, bro."
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.280]   "I ain't playing it, sorry."
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:04.680]   "You played the mattress guy, you won't play Hank."
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.680]   "Geez."
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.360]   Do you think we'll get taken down because I played mattress Mike?
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.360]   "I don't."
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.600]   "Well, you played a show about him."
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.200]   "That's what was going to be about."
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.280]   "Matress Mac."
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.640]   "Matress Mac."
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.800]   "You're going to get taken down because you just named him."
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.040]   "I don't know if Mattress Mac is on his watch."
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:28.720]   "I don't know."
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.320]   "Here's how they're going to do it.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:37.360]   Nielsen will rely on a panel of 42,000 homes that it uses to measure traditional broadcasting
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   cable channels."
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.360]   "It's ridiculous."
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.680]   "Initially, this is going to be terrible.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.280]   Nielsen will primarily measure Amazon viewers on TV sets."
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:53.960]   The very fact that they use the phrase TV sets sounds like the '50s.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.160]   "I am going to go home and watch the game on my TV set."
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:02.040]   "Can you touch those great Amazon rabbit ears we got on that TV?"
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.480]   "Boy, Jeff, did you have a set of rabbit ears?"
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.880]   "Is it UHF or VHF?"
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:13.080]   "Nilsome will also track audiences on mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:18.960]   Amazon will also provide advertisers with its own viewing data, which will show what
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   BS Nielsen is."
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.520]   "That's going to be interesting."
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:29.000]   But what's interesting about this is how much of an advertising company Amazon now is.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.080]   Its advertising revenue is bigger than the revenue of the entire magazine industry.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.560]   But think about this.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:43.560]   They spent for Thursday Night Football $1.2 billion a season for 11 seasons.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.320]   They spent big bucks.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.480]   They're going to count somewhat on advertising revenue.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.520]   I think Amazon probably feels like it's also a benefit to Amazon Prime and so forth.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.080]   But I think they want to recoup some of them.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.000]   Can you all look at stream just the football?
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.040]   Are you only for Prime or is it free with Prime?
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.040]   What's the deal?
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.680]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.280]   It's free with Prime video.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.600]   Excuse me.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.440]   I don't think you could just buy the...
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440]   I don't know.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   Exclusively on Prime.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.480]   I've watched it on Prime video and I've not spent anything extra.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   Yeah, no.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.960]   I came with Prime last year.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.720]   But remember they were sharing it with...
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.720]   Let me see.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.720]   Oh, that's right.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.720]   They were sharing it with NFL.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.360]   It says included with Prime.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.720]   Prime video is the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football beginning in 2022, 15 regular
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720]   season games.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:40.000]   They spent almost a billion dollars a game starting September 15th.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.240]   All are included with Prime and yes, you have...
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.120]   1.2 billion dollars a year for 11 years.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.120]   Right.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.120]   That's not...
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.560]   The same year as the point 2 billion is a game.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.560]   Well 1.2...
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.560]   Oh, you're right.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.560]   Never mind.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.080]   I mean, I met 100 million a game.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.080]   You're right.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.080]   Little bath.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.280]   I'm divided right.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.720]   It's 1.2 billion dollars for 15 games.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.120]   So it's like 90 million or something.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   A game.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.120]   It's like...
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120]   It's like 900...
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   It's like...
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.120]   It's like 900...
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.120]   It's like 900...
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.120]   It's like 900...
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.120]   I don't know.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   It's like 900...
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.120]   It's like 900...
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.120]   There hardly ever does a football game.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.920]   For a while, I don't know why.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.360]   This was the game where they would wear neon uniforms.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.360]   Yeah, and that's the thing.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.440]   They'd do the whole colorway uniforms.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.280]   Each team would have a special Thursday colorway uniform.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.520]   But the games are usually pretty entertaining.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.480]   Ant is like the only normal person in a whole world.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480]   On this panel.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.960]   He has a herb, Kirk Street is.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.640]   And I have to give him Kirk for that.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:52.000]   I'm going to campaign to get him renamed.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.880]   If Al Michaels even wants in those 15 games calls him Herb Kirk Street, that would be great
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880]   happy.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.280]   Well, you know, Herb.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.240]   Every Thursday, a football game has multiple broadcasts, options.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.560]   Well, there's a typo right there.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.200]   Good job, Amazon.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.360]   Multiple broadcasts, options to choose from.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.000]   Whether it's the primary broadcast featuring Al Michaels and Herb Kirk Street, an alternate
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:28.040]   stream, such as TNF with Dude Perfect or TNF and Español.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.720]   Each presentation of TNF on Prime Video offers a different set of alternate streams.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.640]   They did that last year too.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.920]   Like they would have Peyton Manning and Eli Manning doing the play-by-play of the game.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   It was horrible.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.520]   Can they have football for dummies too?
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.600]   Dude, perfect.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.920]   I think he might be the guy.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   He's your guy.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   Really?
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.920]   I don't know who's Dude.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.920]   If he's a perfect dude, I think he's so Dude.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.960]   You don't explain anything to you because if you were a Dude, you would be the best player
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   in your perfect.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:59.280]   It's an American sports and comedy group.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:05.240]   Tyler Tony, twins Corey and Kobe Cotton, Garrett, Hilbert and Cody Jones, former college
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:11.080]   roommates at Texas A&M, baby.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.720]   That's a different school.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.560]   That's not a school that I'm excited about.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.720]   That's not the eyes of Texas or upon you.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.600]   That's our arch rival.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.600]   Dude, perfect.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.400]   That's edgy for God's sakes.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.480]   So they do trickshots.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:33.200]   They'll be great for hosting.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.280]   This is what they do.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.400]   They do.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.720]   This is what Amazon's doing.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.440]   They're trying to get younger people to watch football, right?
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.200]   So they get these YouTube stars doing it or something.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.000]   Yeah, my son probably knows who he is.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   Dude, perfect.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.440]   I think they were featured in the Super Bowl last year.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   Oh, really?
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.400]   In LA, they came out and did an event with...
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.400]   Hey, man.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400]   You know how to have those cannons to shoot...
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.240]   He has a tissue ball racket.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:02.880]   They made another modified cannon that's big enough to shoot up to the top level of the
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   stadium.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.480]   So, apparently you can go on a cruise with them.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.080]   That's a sure way to get coated.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.000]   Tell me about it.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   Tell me about it.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.760]   We should have said that about two months ago.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   We did.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.760]   Anyway, oh yeah.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.440]   Yeah, none of us were excited about cruise thoughts.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.080]   None of you thought this would end well.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.400]   And Mehta has just decided to do...
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.480]   Maybe we should turn that switch, flip that switch on end to end encryption on messenger.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:41.120]   Oh yeah, we did ask that last week.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.920]   Someone in Discord asked that.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:48.760]   They flipped the switch after, of course, that horrible story about the mother and daughter.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.160]   It was already on.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.040]   It's already literally flipped.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.040]   I don't know.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.040]   I'm logging in.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.280]   Okay, can you tell your friends at Conde asked something for me?
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.560]   So, how many magazines does Conde have?
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.560]   Quite a few, right?
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.760]   A few are about it now that they used to.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.520]   Yeah, there's the New Yorker, there's Vandy Fair, there's Wired Fair.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:17.280]   So I have an account for several of their magazines, New Yorker and Wired.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.400]   But every time you log into Wired, which I'm trying to do, it doesn't take you to Wired.com.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.360]   It takes you to Conde Nast.com.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:32.960]   And so it pops up my password for Conde Nast, which is not the same for Wired Digital.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.760]   So it breaks my password manager.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.560]   So we'll tell your friends at Conde to stop it.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.040]   Either come up with one subscription for everything.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.680]   SSO, baby.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.080]   You know, Leo, I got Hank Green, so you can put the video.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.480]   But you wouldn't listen to him.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.360]   So why am I going to use your reputation for Conde Nast?
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   I need your help.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.760]   In order to sign into my account, I have to select all images with bridges.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   That would be good at this, Jeff.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.720]   No, I need a trigger warning on that.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.720]   Where's a bridge?
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720]   Is that a bridge?
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.720]   That's an overpass.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.120]   That ain't a bridge.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.800]   That's an overpass.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.440]   I don't see any other bridges.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.960]   Do you see any underneath one in the one in the middle of the tic-tac-toe spot?
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.960]   Is that a bridge?
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960]   I'm under an overpass.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   You're under an overpass.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.320]   What does that count or no?
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.320]   No.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   No.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.240]   Oh, it was a bridge.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   I told you.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.640]   Liars, it wasn't a bridge.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.160]   We're both overpasses.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160]   Overpasses.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.320]   Finally, I can read you this article.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.120]   Meta, just...
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.320]   So can you please talk to your friends at Conde Nast?
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   Tweet him.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.320]   No.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320]   Tweet him.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.320]   I used my poll with Hank.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.320]   Tweet him.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.320]   I'm not doing it.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.880]   Do not.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.680]   So meanwhile, a move that Meta says is totally unrelated to the story from Nebraska.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.960]   The social media giant announced this morning, which was August 11, so a few mornings
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   ago.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960]   A little behind.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.440]   Well, I don't do this show every day.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:03.880]   We haven't had a show since the 10th, so this was after the show last week.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:09.840]   The social media giant announced this morning, a week ago, that is testing expansions of
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.840]   end-to-end encrypted messaging.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.320]   Oh, they always test stuff.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.320]   Messenger.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.320]   Yeah, they got tested.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.800]   They're testing, also testing a secure storage feature for end-to-end encrypted chats so
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.880]   you can back up your messages securely.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.960]   Now, do you think the secret servers start using a Facebook messenger?
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.960]   That might be cool.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.240]   Company says a secure backup feature be the default for end-to-end encryption chats on
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.240]   Messenger.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.640]   You can lock the backups of the pin or a generated code.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640]   The features design.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.080]   So Meta will not be able to access the backups.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:42.760]   Honestly, Meta, like every other company, doesn't want to be able to respond to those
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.760]   subpoenas, right?
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760]   Right.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.760]   They want to be able to say, oh, sorry.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.760]   I don't know.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.760]   See?
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.360]   Isn't that plausible deniability?
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.680]   That's one way to put it.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.480]   I think mostly, look, I don't know if Meta really doesn't want to help law enforcement
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.480]   in a case like this.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.600]   They may very well want to, but they don't want the heat that they got from it.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.040]   So they'd much prefer just to say, hey, we can't help you.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:12.520]   Meta spokesperson told Wired, this is not a response to any law enforcement requests.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.360]   We've had this date in the diary for months, but the short notice is because Messenger
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.800]   product teams have been finalizing the tests that are going live.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.560]   These tests will start last Thursday a week ago.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.760]   We want people to hear about these tests from us before they see the changes in the app.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   So good.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:35.440]   I mean, it was three years ago, Mark Zuckerberg said, and then encryption everywhere.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.200]   So they're finally getting around to it.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.360]   They were going to become the encryption company, right?
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360]   It was the whole thing.
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.280]   All right, let's take a little break and then it's TikTok corner that changed along all
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   the things you've come to Twig to expect.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.840]   Yes.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.280]   For Stacy and Yay.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280]   Yay.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.280]   Okay.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.800]   You know, every night Lisa goes to bed.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.200]   I'm glad she goes to bed.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.200]   I was other.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.200]   Sometimes she doesn't.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:10.520]   It shouldn't be news to you, but she puts her watch and her iPhone on Nomads base one
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.520]   charger.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.120]   This is an awesome charger.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.680]   I actually got it for her because I said, oh, Lisa, this, this was because she, the watch
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.520]   would fall off her charger.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.960]   So now she, this is so awesome.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.920]   She puts, she puts her phone on the, on the MagSafe charger.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.560]   She puts our watch right next to it and boom, they're charging together.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:37.320]   By the way, they now have the limited edition gold version.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.120]   I got her the black one because she likes red and black, but this is one of many great
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.200]   products from Nomad.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.840]   Nomad was started as a Kickstarter project many moons ago, but they've always had one
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.840]   goal in mind to create products that are better made, that are better designed.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.320]   Oh, oh, I have, I have my chargers.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.680]   I have my chargers right here, better made and better designed than the run of the mill
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.680]   stuff.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.120]   This is the MagSafe charger.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:11.480]   And as soon as you have it, you realize boy, it is the weight and this is one of the things
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.640]   I love, all the Nomad products come with their braided cables.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.600]   They got tired of the flimsy charging cables that fall apart every few months.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.960]   I'm sure you are too.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.600]   So they decided to engineer the most rugged cables around.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.060]   They're reinforced.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:31.440]   They're braided, which I love, but they're double braided Kevlar outer shield.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:36.940]   The connector is a strong metal alloy, the housings metal alloy engineered for extreme
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.240]   durability, every, every day use.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.600]   This is a Nomad cable.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.760]   This is just, it's the detail, the attention to detail.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.960]   How about the Nomad leather cases and Apple watch straps?
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:53.400]   I have a wonderful Apple watch strap that's Nomad leather premium wallets, passport holders,
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.840]   all crafted with beautiful whore ween leather.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:00.160]   Hore ween is a tannery in Chicago, more than a hundred years old.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.040]   Oh, that's more good.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:07.280]   They offer an unparalleled blend of quality and consistency.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.160]   And what's nice about these, this is a brand new one.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.320]   But as you use it, all my Nomad wallets and everything are like this.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.360]   They get petenid because it's good leather and they're unique.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.520]   They're just, they're only you, but the leather smell does not, does not go away.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.240]   It smells so fantastic.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:29.200]   It just feels like luxury, rugged and minimalist tools for the 21st century that seamlessly
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.960]   integrate into your everyday carry.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:38.760]   This is the Nomad stainless steel band for the Apple watch.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:44.600]   Again, heavy, you can tell it's quality, solid metal, it's beautiful.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.760]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.680]   They're a climate neutral certified brand.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.280]   Nomad is and always will be a company that prioritizes design and quality over everything
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.600]   else.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.560]   And for them, one of the most important aspects to Nomad when they're designing new products
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.960]   is to use the best materials, the longest lasting, the highest quality materials.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:07.000]   And they are not white labeling somebody else's stuff.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.800]   They design everything from the ground up.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.240]   They always have and they manufacture it themselves.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.320]   So you know, you're getting really good quality, excellent stuff.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.680]   I just love Nomad goods.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.680]   And I so does Lisa.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:25.640]   I have to tell you, if you want that gold one right now, get head over there.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:29.240]   It's a limited time offer on the base one, Max.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:32.760]   Beautiful silver, gold or black, the best stuff.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.720]   Go to nomadgoods.com/twig.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:40.080]   Oh, and by the way, use the promo code TWIG.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.880]   You'll get 10% off your first purchase of any Nomad accessory.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.360]   That's nomadgoods.com/twig.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.800]   And the promo code is twig.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.200]   It's a limited time offer.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.000]   Don't wait.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.640]   Love the Nomad goods.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.960]   Really nicely made stuff.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.000]   They'll look good, they'll feel good and you will love them.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.280]   Thank you Nomad.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.040]   Thank you very much for supporting this week in Google.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.880]   You support us of course when you use that special address.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.200]   All right, Aunt, hide your head.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.840]   Actually, before we do that, I just have a question.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.360]   Wait, you left.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.960]   Reprieve here from the--
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.040]   No TikTok yet.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:22.960]   Like gallows.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.160]   Say more.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.040]   She was already leaning away from the mic to run.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.280]   She's like, I'm out.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.160]   So thank me.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.160]   I'm telling you, you're going to thank me, but go ahead.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.520]   There's a guy.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.680]   We've had him on our shows.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.800]   He's been around for a long time.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.840]   I worked with him in Canada and had a tech TV.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.480]   Darren Kitchen, right?
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.280]   You know Darren.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.560]   He has the Hack 5 show.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.400]   He sells-- well, he sells, I think, questionable goods
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.240]   in his hackers store, the pineapple--
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.960]   Pintesting stuff, for what I remember, right?
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.320]   OK, so that's my question.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.040]   They call it pen testing stuff.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.560]   It's hackers tools.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.280]   So they've just announced the new USB rubber ducky.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.160]   This is what the Verge writes.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.060]   The beloved hacker tool can now
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.560]   pwn you with its own programming language.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.880]   So it looks like a USB key.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.480]   But instead of being a USB key when you plug it into a computer,
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.400]   the machine sees it as a keyboard, which
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.640]   means it can type in any commands.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.120]   And here it was what Darren Kitchen says.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.440]   Everything it types is trusted to the same degree
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.880]   as the user is trusted.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.080]   So it takes advantage of the trust model built-in
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.120]   where computers are being taught to trust a human.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.600]   And the computer knows that a human typically communicates it
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.200]   with it through clicking and typing.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.600]   It can be used to hack machines.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.520]   Pen testing.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.120]   That's what it is.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.480]   Keystroke injection attacks with advanced ducky script.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.200]   But you have to have physical access to the device.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.200]   Well, or you could just leave it lying on the ground outside.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.680]   Oh, I'll try this.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.080]   Hey, if we were to speak to you.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.800]   So is there a radio in it that you communicate with?
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.520]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.800]   That's a good point.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.240]   Does it just hack into your machine?
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.320]   You have to retrieve it.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.400]   You'd have to retrieve it.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.880]   Well, it could actually could run.
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.600]   It could run a tool that would then--
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.760]   Yeah, it was a tool for the vulnerability.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:23.000]   I mean, there's plenty of USB hacks out there
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.880]   that doesn't seem like a problem having an easier one
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.200]   if it is indeed easier.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:28.680]   Sure.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:29.160]   I don't know.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.560]   I'm like--
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.400]   It's not-- I guess it's not illegal, but it's just--
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:34.840]   I don't know.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:39.080]   And think about all-- I mean, you should never plug an unidentified
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.760]   USB into any machine.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.320]   I mean--
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.040]   This is true.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.080]   That's like--
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.920]   In--
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.160]   Anyway, he shows it off--
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.960]   OK, I get scared to plug it in the ones from CES
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.680]   when you go to the booths and they're trying to get--
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.240]   Oh, I don't plug them in, man.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.680]   I'm always like--
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.880]   It feels like there's a lot of rationalizing going,
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.120]   well, it's a pen testing tool.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.520]   Oh, yeah, I see it teaches people not to do this.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:03.880]   I don't know.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.800]   I feel like you're selling tools to hack people.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.400]   But you don't think a lot of people
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.440]   in tools to give to the bad guys?
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:13.640]   There are--
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.120]   Lock picking kits are illegal in many jurisdictions.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:17.760]   Are they really?
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:21.240]   Yeah, unless you're a locksmith.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.520]   I had no idea.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.400]   So I don't know.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.160]   I just-- so if I were to try to order a lock picking kit
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.120]   from Amazon right now, would Amazon block it?
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.400]   Lock picking kit.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.960]   I think you can buy it, but I wouldn't get caught carrying it
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:42.400]   around.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.160]   I thought it was illegal, but you're right.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.080]   Here I am.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.480]   Oh, and a lock pick is not illegal in most states.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.960]   OK, lock pick world.com.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.520]   It's only considered a crime if you use them illegally.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.400]   So you have to know that.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.000]   She's looking--
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.200]   Oh, they're reading this.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.120]   --and so that, yeah.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.720]   So it's not illegal.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.240]   Research.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.400]   So this is probably like that.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.200]   Most states in the US allow for the purchase
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.360]   and possession of lock picks.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.920]   In Mississippi, the possession of lock picks is illegal.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.920]   But the concealment of such can be considered prima facia
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.560]   evidence of intent to commit a crime.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.360]   So you should open carry your lock picks.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.560]   Open carry, please.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.560]   Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia laws require one
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:26.960]   to prove otherwise the prima facia evidence of intent.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.640]   Illinois has a specific provision on lock bumping.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.120]   You can't buy a lock bump.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.720]   And Tennessee has laws on locksmithing.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.960]   So it's not completely illegal.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.080]   So I feel like, I guess it's kind of like that.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.040]   They're legitimate uses for lock picks, though, right?
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.600]   Completely legitimate.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.880]   Well, aren't there legitimate uses for penetration testing
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.200]   tools to help the enterprise that whatever--
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.440]   You don't need a USB rubber ducky to do pen testing.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:57.960]   No.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.000]   No, you don't.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.400]   But I'm just saying that's probably just one of the tools
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   is a trade.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.480]   You can make it-- yeah.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   Not my lock pick, man.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.560]   This is one of many stories coming out of Defcon Black Hat
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.160]   besides all the hacker summer camp.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.360]   John Deere.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.920]   Oh, did you see this one?
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:16.920]   That's a good one.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.920]   A new jailbreak for John Deere tractors.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.640]   I put up a Corey Doctorow thread on watching it happen.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.000]   Yeah, Corey was in the audience.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.880]   So an Australian hacker named Sick Codes
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:38.480]   actually was able to break into the tractor programming
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.360]   interfaces on John Deere tractor.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.080]   He's actually an Australian who was in Asia.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:50.160]   He broke into their module, and he convinced the module
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.200]   that he was an authorized dealer.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.280]   And basically, from there, he could reprogram or do
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.000]   whatever he wanted.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.880]   So he put a special agricultural version of doom on it.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.520]   Which Corey quite enjoyed, I remember.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.640]   He also learned that John Deere is using a fairly ancient
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.760]   version of Linux--
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.920]   Linux 8.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.560]   Linux 8.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.120]   We're up to 15 now.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.560]   And less common, Windows CE.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:28.480]   Probably not secure and almost certainly a violation of GPL.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.800]   He launched the attack, and two minutes later, a terminal
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.000]   pops up.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.760]   I had root access, which is rare in Deere land.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:41.000]   Farmers did not want him to show--
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.520]   This is interesting.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.320]   Farmers hate him because they would hack it.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.240]   And then he would basically let John Deere know--
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:53.280]   not from farmers, but people-- he would figure it out.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.480]   He would publicize it, and then John Deere would fix it.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.080]   And they were like, please stop telling them.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.600]   This is the only way we can fix our tractors when they break
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.360]   down, because John Deere--
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:02.880]   Exactly.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.320]   --was us to go to an authorized repair person,
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.360]   and that can take weeks.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.080]   Which is impressive.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:07.840]   And the crops are dead.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:12.360]   The farmers figured it out before the hackers did.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.760]   Farmers are just very mechanically and whatever.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.600]   They're hackers.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.800]   They're mechanically inclined.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.800]   Resor, thank you.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.360]   That's the word.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.320]   I've never met a farmer who can't figure something out.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.040]   All right.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.240]   Period.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.400]   Six codes after he made his research public last year
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.960]   at Def Con said, the right to repair
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.440]   side was a little bit opposed to what I was trying to do.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.600]   I heard from some farmers, one guy emailed me and said,
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.280]   you're f'ing up all our stuff.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.320]   But that was last year.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.160]   This year, his hack was so powerful.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.400]   He said, I figured I put my money where my mouth isn't
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.560]   actually proved to farmers they can root the devices.
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:01.760]   So once they do, then Deere can get back into it
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   and take it back?
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.200]   Right.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.400]   So I'm sure Deere will try to patch these vulnerabilities,
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.520]   of course.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.680]   Somebody's working on that right now.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.000]   Have they talked about this on Floss Weekly?
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.120]   Actually, we did, sir.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.080]   Mr. Jonathan Bennett, our untitled Linux show host
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:21.800]   and club twit.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.920]   He's apparently, you know, sick codes quite well
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.400]   and got a lot of joy out of this.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.440]   And today's guest, Dave Tack, was pretty much up in normal.
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.000]   It was because of the version of Linux that's being used.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:35.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.080]   And because they're not violating the JPL.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.800]   They're not adhering to the license.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.080]   Good.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.760]   Try to get sick codes on the show.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.560]   That would be really cool.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:44.960]   I'm John.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.480]   I'm John.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.000]   I'm just kidding.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.920]   The Corey thread is that when he put it back on,
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:53.640]   it tried to send 1.5 gigabytes of data up to Deere.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:55.720]   Ooh.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:56.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.200]   There's a lot of data on those things.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.920]   So Deere actually created their own custom GPS
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.280]   to address things like the tilt of the earth and things
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.040]   like that because it needs to be so precision for seeds
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.880]   and that sort of for planting.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:14.840]   So they've actually done quite a bit of--
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.720]   they've done quite a bit with sensors
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.000]   and with machine learning on their tractors.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.160]   So it doesn't surprise me that those things are sending
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.440]   lots of data.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.400]   I know we hate Deere, but they've built some really cool stuff.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.040]   Oh, my God.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:27.400]   Yes.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.400]   It's super cool.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:28.880]   Machines.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.200]   And our food supply relies on them.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.320]   That's a little less cool.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.200]   So Corey says he discovered that all
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.240]   it took to convince the computer that he was a dealer
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.040]   was to create an empty text file on its hard drive whose
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:43.200]   file name was something like imdealer.text.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.360]   Says Corey, I didn't write down the exact file name
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.280]   alas, but it's not far off.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:47.560]   Wow.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.080]   Right.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:48.600]   Wow.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:53.320]   It makes use of-- a great deal of use of free and open source
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:59.320]   software, gravely out of compliance with license terms.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.840]   John Deere's probably running not picks.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.960]   Well, Corey also figured there were a few Deere people
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.920]   in the audience.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:06.680]   Oh, yes.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.200]   So--
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:07.720]   Oh, yes.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.480]   Yeah, of course.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.840]   You know, their tech people are probably at odds
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.280]   with their business people.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:19.760]   And to some-- like, I'm really torn on some of this.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:27.960]   As we use sensors to highly optimize machines with software,
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:31.440]   it does become much more of an issue
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:38.680]   when that software is broken inadvertently or advertently,
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.800]   simply because it changes the way they might operate.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.960]   It might create weird dependencies.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:48.000]   And I'm not trying to defend them for not--
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.680]   it's a really--
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.120]   I don't think Deere's behaving well.
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.160]   But I do understand things with type
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.040]   to security and regular updates.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.560]   We have to come to some sort of middle ground
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:04.000]   on building this sort of software--
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.240]   tight software to machine integration
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:12.440]   and then making it possible to fix things easily and not
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:17.600]   as in economically for regular use, I guess.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.800]   Because some of the stuff-- like, their emissions stuff,
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.800]   I do think there's probably some-- that's not just FUD.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.200]   I don't know.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.520]   That's just me.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.600]   There's a way to do it.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:27.920]   Right.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.080]   There's a way to do it.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.920]   Well, I think we should be exploring that.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.840]   And that's also why I say with future business models related
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.920]   to connected devices are going to have to rely so much
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:39.920]   on people trusting the company providing those services.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:41.720]   And we're not there yet because everybody
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:45.920]   is like this weird capitalistic--
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.240]   let's just gouge as much money out of people as possible.
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:52.360]   And that actually isn't sustainable.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.800]   And we're going to turn our backs on some really good technology
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.160]   because we understand that it's going to actively
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.680]   be used against us.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.120]   And it's a shame.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:01.760]   But I get it.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:11.600]   Yeah, Reed Corey's full post on pluralistic about this.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.280]   And he makes a very strong case about why what John Deuce
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.520]   is doing is so very, very wrong and basically monopolistic.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:22.800]   It is.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.400]   Corey's new book, "Choke Point Capitalism--
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.160]   How Big Tech and Big Content Captured Creative Labor Markets
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.560]   and How We'll Win Them Back."
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.320]   I'm going to get--
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.960]   I'm funding now by you.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:36.880]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.720]   Kickstarter.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:42.520]   We're going to get-- I'm going to try to get Corey on to talk
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.880]   about that because you have a little bit more time,
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.920]   I think, on the Kickstarter.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.840]   I'd love to give them some--
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.400]   Yeah, they've already met their goals.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:54.040]   Yeah, but they should meet their goals and then some.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:54.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.060]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:57.680]   The more people who can access this book, the better.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.920]   "Choke Point Capitalism."
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.360]   Hearing aids are going over the counter.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.440]   Huge news, the FDA finally moved.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.400]   They finalized OTC hearing aids that
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.200]   could be sold without a prescription of people
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.240]   with mild to moderate hearing loss available as soon
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.960]   as October.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:24.040]   Hearing aids cost around $6,000.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.880]   You have to also visit an audiologist to get tested.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.560]   There's bought one for my father last week.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:31.480]   Especially mold too, right?
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.480]   $3,500 for $1 plus $120 for the mold.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.680]   If you use that kind, you don't have to have the mold
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.600]   unless your hearing is bad enough.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.840]   But my father is, if you don't use the mold,
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.120]   the feedback is off--
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:44.840]   Oh, it squeaks.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:48.920]   So the mold not only makes it easier for him to hear,
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:52.400]   it also stops us from hearing all that.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.120]   This was for one hearing aid because his other ear is just
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.920]   a goner.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.800]   But what I don't understand about this, Leo,
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:03.480]   is who's to say the price is going to come down?
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.960]   Well, already-- and we'll know in October--
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.960]   but already, competition should bring the prices down.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.160]   Right now, a few companies dominate it.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.240]   They dominate--
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.240]   Well, you don't have to go to an audiologist.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.600]   They dominate because you require an audiologist,
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.440]   and so they make deals with it.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.360]   But our audiologist really made a lot of adjustments that--
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.040]   Well, he do.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:21.600]   Specialized.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.120]   So you might have seen an ad right after the butt deodorant
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.880]   for a thing called lively hearing aids.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.600]   I've already started seeing these ads on MSNBC.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.560]   These are $1,300 for a pair, a lot less.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560]   And they don't--
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.000]   It's a third.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.400]   You don't use an audiologist.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.280]   You have an app on your phone that does the test
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.240]   and then sets the hearing aids.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.840]   Now, admittedly, when I got my hearing aids,
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.240]   I went to an audiologist.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.480]   They do an extensive hearing test.
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.440]   They adjust it.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.520]   You go back in several times to get them further
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.720]   adjusted.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.720]   There's a lot of even psychological adjustment
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:03.400]   to wearing hearing aids, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:08.200]   In fact, good article in Wired from Jaipreet Verde,
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.920]   the unintended consequences of OTC hearing aids.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.040]   He's profoundly death from birth.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.960]   Death from-- oh, no, I guess not from birth.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.040]   But he's 98% hearing loss in both years for over 30 years.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.120]   He talks about the fact that, yeah, not having
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:28.760]   audiologists in the mix and all the marketing that
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.760]   might happen from over-the-counter hearing aids
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.800]   might mean that people get a worse experience
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.800]   and then decide not to wear hearing aids.
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:42.680]   And so that's-- what needs to change
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.720]   is how we perceive hearing aids in the first place.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.760]   Rather than leaning heavily on the implication,
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.360]   hearing aids are inherently embarrassing.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.640]   These devices should be marketed as tools
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.120]   for highlighting the vitality and richness of deaf experience.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.120]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.840]   They're saying there's a stigma behind hearing aids?
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:02.080]   There are, because people feel their whole--
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.600]   That's why a lot of old people don't wear them.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.880]   In fact-- Oh, not know that.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.680]   In fact, I would say--
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.440]   let me see here.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:17.600]   About 28 million US adults could benefit
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.520]   from wearing hearing aids, but most choose not to.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.680]   More than half choose not to.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:29.680]   13% of the American population has some hearing loss.
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.800]   That's 28 million.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.760]   Because-- and this has started in the '30s, physicians framed
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:39.640]   deafness as a worrisome public health problem.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.840]   Yeah, it indicates that your old Medicare does not
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.880]   cover hearing aids.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:49.840]   Cost of hearing aids is really outrageous.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.760]   Let's see, according to guidelines presented in October
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.320]   of last year, OTC hearing aids will
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:57.680]   be available from any seller over the counter, sold at approximately $600
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.440]   a pair, about a tenth what I paid.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:04.880]   The average cost of $5,000 more than $14,000 a pair, which
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.080]   includes fittings and follow-up services.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.880]   But without customized fitting, without those adjustments
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:15.080]   that your dad got--
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.800]   Which mattered greatly.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:19.000]   The audiologist spent 15 minutes, 20 minutes,
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.400]   standing out in the hall, talking to him,
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.760]   seeing what sounds didn't work, coming back adjusting.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.680]   The other thing that we found out the hard way
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.840]   was when he was in Florida, he bought one under the Audabel
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.800]   brand.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.320]   Audabel is a subsidiary of Starkey,
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.680]   which makes a lot of hearing aids.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:35.600]   I have Starkey's.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.840]   A lot of places.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.280]   But if you buy an Audabel, just like John Deere Tractor,
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:45.000]   they're locked so that no other audiologist but an Audabel
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.640]   brand person can see and change the settings.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.480]   I think that's the case.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:51.800]   And I had a drive an hour and a half
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.840]   to get his hearing aid adjusted in Pennsylvania,
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.240]   because there was no place here.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.480]   That's why we bought a new one just simply because we couldn't
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.720]   get around the adjustments.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:02.080]   I think the answer to this, though, is going to be--
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.080]   and I think it's coming from companies like Apple--
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.600]   making them part of your AirPods experience,
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.800]   your standard kind of headphone experience,
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.600]   positioning them not as something for old people,
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.720]   but as something that enhances your hearing--
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.000]   For the lately deaf, yes.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.360]   Yeah, or the deaf.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.480]   Yeah, if you're going to have to get--
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.880]   I mean, what, you're deaf.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.040]   Yeah, if you're super--
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.440]   yeah, and that's exactly it.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:31.120]   If you're super handicapped, if you're super unable to hear,
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.560]   you're going to have to deal with this.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.880]   But we've had hero bowls for a while, which
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.800]   is what these kind of augmented hearing things,
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.360]   they are going to get better.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.520]   I think they'll also reduce stigma, right?
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.120]   I think it'll reduce stigma, because you'll
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.000]   see much more innovation--
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.280]   like some of the innovations from consumer electronics
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:52.680]   around battery life and Bluetooth connectivity,
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.280]   like, I don't know about you, but my mom,
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.520]   when she's trying to connect her, you're hearing it's--
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.000]   Oh, it's a pain.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.320]   It's a real nightmare.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.400]   So I think we're going to see some good stuff.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:08.320]   And you're right, this isn't going to be for everyone.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.320]   The more hearing loss you have, the more
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:12.600]   you'll have to go to a professional.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:18.320]   But I think instead of starting when you're like 50,
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.400]   maybe you start when you're 70.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.960]   And the innovations you see at the bottom,
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.120]   and they're going to be pushed up to the top end
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.160]   and pricing as well, because they'll be more competition.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.480]   So I think this is good.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.960]   I think ultimately it is.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:36.840]   But I hadn't really thought about the unintended consequences.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:40.800]   So Japreet's article as well, I think well taken.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.480]   And definitely there's a difference between the people
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.200]   who need, like me, who can hear, but need a little help.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.040]   And people who are profoundly deaf.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.400]   And I think the over-the-counting stuff,
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.640]   over-the-counter stuff, is really more
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:54.520]   intended for people like me.
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.680]   I wish insurance companies, including Medicare,
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:59.440]   were required to cover hearing aids.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.840]   Unbelievable that Medicare doesn't cover it.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:04.200]   Now, can you, for a health savings account,
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.560]   can it count under that?
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:06.560]   I think you can do that.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.200]   Sure, yeah.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:08.840]   I'm pretty sure.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:11.240]   But still, it's very expensive.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.240]   We're talking a lot more.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:12.720]   It is.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.200]   Well, that's why Medicare doesn't want to cover it.
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.400]   You got to draw the line somewhere, I guess.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.200]   Fair point.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.200]   Fair point.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.760]   Um, he's trying to avoid it.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760]   He's trying to go away.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.560]   And he's trying to find something else to talk about.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.320]   But you know, it's just out there waiting to be done.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:38.240]   Oracle is beginning to audit TikTok's algorithms.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:42.400]   That's because the Chinese government started calling for social media companies in the
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.440]   country to audit their algorithms.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.440]   That's right.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.920]   And it's Project Texas.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.120]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.920]   Yes, that's what this called because I guess Oracle is in Texas.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.680]   It's based in Texas.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200]   The idea is really not so much.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:04.320]   I think they're doing it to reassure Congress and maybe the American people that the TikTok
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.240]   US is not an arm of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.040]   Right?
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.920]   I had a guy call, the last call of the radio show this weekend saying, don't you think
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.280]   TikTok is a Chinese conspiracy and you know, shouldn't we ban it?
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   I said, well, he said, I know your son is a TikTok star, but shouldn't we ban it?
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280]   And I like Jeff.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:34.280]   And maybe some of you think that it's a great venue for creators just like YouTube.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.280]   Yes.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.920]   And I don't think it's a bad thing to have some oversight.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:40.400]   And I think maybe this is the way to do it by dance.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.040]   It does collect a lot of data.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.960]   It does collect a lot of data just so you know, it's collecting your location data.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.160]   Like everything else.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.960]   Yeah, I'm less worried about that.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.960]   I'm more worried about that.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.520]   Yeah, what are the Chinese going to do with that?
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:52.520]   Yeah, do they care?
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:53.680]   So they know where I am.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.600]   If they understand like not necessarily you, Jeff, but let's say you have access, let's
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:03.800]   say you work at a company like, I don't know, Twilio, they can use that information to target
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.600]   individuals that they might be interested in fishing.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.760]   And follow Chinese expatriate Chinese dissidents and so forth.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:12.960]   It's not so I don't trust China.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.120]   I'm not saying I'm not defending the Chinese.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:19.600]   I'm just saying the solution of that is to not let people with sensitive jobs have yes,
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.640]   TikTok or a smartphone.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:24.000]   I mean, look at everything on our phone.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.400]   So maybe they should not carry their phone or where I mean, there's got to be some solutions,
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.440]   but it doesn't mean necessarily.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:34.240]   I mean, everything, Facebook's tracking you too.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.240]   Everybody's tracking you.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:41.000]   I mean, didn't we try to give the leader of the US a dumb, a dumbish smartphone at one
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000]   point in time?
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000]   That's what stuff like that.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000]   I think we still do.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.560]   I think we still do.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:51.040]   So TikTok said it's been routing all its US user data oracles cloud infrastructure.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:54.800]   So all the stuff is stored in Texas.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.600]   And now they say they're going to establish a partnership with an outside firm to oversee
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.480]   its algorithms.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.760]   Because I think that's the secondary concern.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:10.080]   Maybe to me even more important is that what if the Chinese government started forcing
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:16.600]   bite dance to promote things that are in the interest of the Chinese government and subtly
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:19.320]   modify our thinking through TikTok?
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.800]   Is that possible?
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:26.880]   Is it possible that there is disinformation on TikTok?
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:29.560]   What if the Chinese government decided, well, this is for this information.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:30.560]   It's okay.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.720]   This isn't, you know, we like that.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:36.800]   Sure, they're already deciding that they already don't show you people who live in crappy
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.480]   homes or fat people.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.480]   Yep.
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:44.320]   Although they got caught and I think they do show you fat people now, but, you know,
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.320]   that's the thing.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:50.960]   The new arrangement gives Oracle regular vetting and validation of TikTok's content recommendation
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.800]   and moderation models.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:59.320]   So not only that the data, but Oracle can see the algorithms.
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.320]   Make you feel better?
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.320]   You trust Oracle?
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:08.360]   Well, I guess more than bite dance, but no.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:14.320]   And again, I think this is not really an attempt to make this fix this, but just to appease
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.560]   Congress.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.560]   Yes.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.560]   Yes.
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:18.560]   Yes.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:21.600]   This is a hundred percent a a sev to Congress.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:25.880]   Oh, it's not just Congress.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:31.120]   I mean, all, all governments right now are looking at auditing algorithms in some form
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.120]   or fashion.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:37.320]   So you mentioned Twilio that Twilio breach now more and more looks targeted.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:43.320]   Yeah, it's a hundred percent targeted by a nation state who was trying to break into
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.960]   somebody's signal account.
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:51.240]   And then encrypted messaging app signal says attackers access the phone numbers and SMS
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:57.360]   verification codes for almost 2,000 users as part of the breach at Twilio last week.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:06.520]   Twilio provides phone number verification services to signal.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:15.000]   It sounds like there were some specific two or three accounts that they were looking for.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:23.800]   While they doesn't mean that signal, the message contents are available to anybody, they're
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:25.200]   not.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:32.000]   Nor does it give the attacker access to the message history, but you could reregister
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.440]   an account and then send and receive signals from that phone number.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.920]   And since on signal you're identified by your phone number, it would allow you to impersonate
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.760]   somebody.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:47.280]   The company says it will unregister signal on all devices that the user is currently using
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:52.240]   or an attacker registered them to and will require users to reregister signal with their
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:56.240]   phone number on their preferred device.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.360]   You should also switch on registration lock if you use signal, a feature that prevents
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:05.520]   the account from being reregistered on another device without your security pin.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:10.280]   So I guess signal thought about this ahead of time.
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:19.240]   So 40 million users use signal, but they were going, it looks like after about 125 specific
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:21.760]   customers.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.840]   And it looks pretty much like a nation state attack target attack.
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:30.240]   Any guesses to which nation in the speculation?
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:31.240]   No.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.560]   And it could be so many of them, right?
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.600]   If you knew a dissident was using signal, I mean it has a limited use, as I said.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.720]   You could only pose as them.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.000]   You can't read their messages or see who they were talking to.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.400]   But you could set up a meeting and then kill somebody.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.400]   That's right.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:51.600]   I read a lot of spy fiction.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.120]   Maybe you should knock that off.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:48:02.880]   Maybe you could also impersonate someone provide documents and misinformation and then help legitimize
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.720]   basically disinfo.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:05.720]   Yep.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:08.800]   As a journalist, we would be susceptible to that.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:15.160]   And Jeff, I think as a journalist, it's your job to understand how people could lie to
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.560]   you or just joking.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.760]   I just don't know.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.160]   Geez, lay off the spot.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.720]   All of us, Stacy.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:32.000]   Did you see, and I recommend it if you didn't, Anne Hathaway and Jared Leto in Week Crash?
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.800]   No, is it week?
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:34.800]   What was it?
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.520]   We, we, I think it was week crash.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.520]   We crashed.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.920]   The story of we work.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.760]   And at the end, Adam Newman and his wife, I think it's Rebecca Newman, walk off with
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.040]   a pretty substantial billion dollars.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.480]   It's tons of money.
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:54.000]   Leaving a lot of investors out of pocket.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.400]   Newman, second act was investing in real estate.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:04.320]   Well, now he has just raised, he's got a new company called Flow and he's just raised
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:13.760]   significant $350 million from Andries and Horowitz, who I guess didn't watch that show.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:20.600]   I mean, but don't they have to do some type of due diligence as investors?
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:21.600]   Yes, they're money.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.600]   Man.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.680]   Well, it's actually not their money.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.480]   How is it?
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:30.840]   How does this cat continue to just get free money from people?
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:31.840]   Flow hasn't even launched.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.280]   It was really good at building up.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.280]   That salesman.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.280]   He's a great salesman.
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:40.200]   He's, he wants to transform the residential real estate market.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:46.360]   He has been buying up properties for the last few years on his own dime.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.520]   Flow, which hasn't launched yet, is expected to launch next year.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:52.600]   Mark Andreessen will be on the board.
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:50:01.120]   Newman is also planning to make a sizable personal investment flow.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:07.240]   Here's what Andreessen wrote in a post on the Horowitz, Andries and Horowitz website.
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:11.960]   It's often underappreciated that only one person has fundamentally redesigned the office
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:20.720]   experience and led a paradigm changing global company in the process, Adam.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:24.280]   Newman has already purchased more than 3,000 apartment units in Miami, Fort Lauderdale,
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.760]   Atlanta and Nashville.
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:31.920]   He is planning to rethink the housing rental market by creating a branded product with
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.880]   consistent service and community features.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.640]   Sounds a lot like we work.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.640]   Flow will operate the property.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:37.640]   It's a huge feature.
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:41.000]   Newman is bought and also offered its services to new developments and other parties.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.440]   By the way, we work was originally, we live.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:47.320]   It was this that was intended to be co-housing.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:48.880]   I thought that came after the work part.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:49.880]   I thought that was the extension.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.240]   No, according to, well, okay, all I saw was a TV show.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:54.240]   So you're right.
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.240]   But according to the TV show.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.320]   I read the book and reported on WeWork.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:50:59.320]   So let me tell you.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:02.840]   So it was later, it wasn't before the workspace thing.
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:03.840]   No.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.840]   Okay.
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:05.840]   No.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:10.160]   Anyway, he's still planning to do it.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:14.720]   He also co-founded a crypto company, Flow Carbon.
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.920]   And he raised $70 million for that last May for injuries in Horowitz.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:21.520]   So they're in doing 420 million 420.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.680]   He keeps coming up.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:29.120]   I don't know.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:32.800]   He's in, and Driesin says he's interested in Flow because the rental real estate market
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.920]   is ripe for disruption.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:37.920]   I want some names.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:42.200]   Who are these people that says, you know what, we're going to sign the check and I know check
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.200]   is old.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:47.320]   That's not used, but who are the people that are saying, yep, we trust this person.
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:51.200]   We're going to just go ahead and send this money in and have them come to the press until
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:57.680]   why they believe whatever this person is telling them, considering the track record.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:03.440]   So Ant, I saw speculation on Twitter, you know, take it for what you will, that there's
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:08.960]   a strategy behind this, which is it's, our recent Horowitz wants to, it's not unlike
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:11.520]   NFTs.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:15.480]   If we invest a whole bunch, other people invest a whole bunch and it'd be worth it.
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:16.480]   Right?
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:17.480]   Look at Clubhouse.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:22.080]   He's key behind Clubhouse and the hype brought the valuation of, you know, we remember what
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.880]   Clubhouse is, though, we don't.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.520]   But they got more investment.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:32.720]   And the other argument that was made was that this is a message to bad boy founders.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.680]   How will forgive anything?
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.040]   We've always said that, haven't we?
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:39.640]   We've always said failure is celebrated in Silicon Valley.
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:41.680]   We fetishize it in America.
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:50.880]   In fact, he said, you know, we love seeing repeat founders build on past successes by
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:53.720]   growing from lessons learned.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:57.200]   For Newman, he added the successes and lessons are plenty.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:01.040]   While we're on the rich get richer.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.840]   That's the rule, right?
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.800]   We're talking billions, not millions, billions of dollars.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.800]   Yep.
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:09.800]   People are trusting this?
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:14.240]   Well, not many need to, Ant, only a few limited partners need to.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:15.840]   I need to find these people.
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:18.480]   Hey, let me talk to you.
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:21.200]   I don't even need a million.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.560]   You know what you need?
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:28.440]   You need a little ringtone interpretive dance.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.440]   Here we go.
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:33.360]   Sound up.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:35.360]   Unbelievable.
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.640]   To those on audio, people are dancing.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:43.840]   That's brilliant, isn't it?
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.560]   Well, brilliant is a big word.
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.040]   I don't know if it's.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.200]   Dude, this is like my life with my child.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:53.000]   He's just somewhat filling it.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.520]   These are just some French people dancing to ringtones.
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.320]   Not even ringtones.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.040]   Notifications sound.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:04.680]   Notifications, isn't it?
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:10.000]   I do this every day.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]   This is my life.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.440]   I dance whenever I hear these sounds, I do interpretive dances.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.440]   They get costume changes.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:28.640]   Well, you can't, you know, they probably just fill them at different times.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:33.600]   By the way, it looks like the TikTok account is all piti-pud de France.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.600]   So a little bit of France.
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.600]   A little bit of France.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.400]   Right there in your TikTok.
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:40.400]   Bum, bum.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:41.400]   Okay.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.400]   That was clever.
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.720]   Yeah, thank you, man.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.840]   I'll take that as a rave review.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:47.840]   So like as well.
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.760]   For the start of TikTok quarter, but there's more.
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.920]   Oh, there's so much more.
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:51.920]   Can you just now?
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.320]   Pick a couple of these because there's just a lot of them.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:58.480]   Well, you could do the kindergarten teacher talking to politicians.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.480]   All right, why not?
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.800]   Now, can we get taken down for the...
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:03.080]   No, because there's no content ID, right?
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:04.080]   Right?
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.080]   Okay.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.080]   We're good.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:07.080]   So this is a...
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:09.400]   You gotta go back to the beginning to turn your sound up to get the first joke, but okay.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:11.560]   Well, I, you know, I don't take this as well.
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.960]   TikTok is auto play and that just takes me off guard.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:16.920]   Thank you so much for cleaning up the ketchup, my friend.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:19.840]   That was really responsible and I appreciate that.
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:23.160]   Are you feeling calm and safe and ready to talk?
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.360]   Okay, great.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360]   How are you feeling now?
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.360]   Sad.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:29.360]   Yeah, I get it.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.360]   Frustrated, maybe?
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:31.360]   Me too.
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.760]   Do you understand why they took those items from you?
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:39.720]   No, not for no reason, friend.
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:41.480]   Those did not belong to you.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:45.520]   You took them home and you were not supposed to, so they took them back.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.520]   The FBI.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:53.320]   We need to start taking some responsibility for our actions.
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:56.080]   Do you know what responsibility means?
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:00.640]   Listen, everybody makes mistakes, okay?
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:02.440]   You can grow an up's thing.
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.240]   You're a grown up.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:05.240]   Okay.
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:10.560]   Um, no honey, we cannot go play golf right now.
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:13.000]   It's pretty cute.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.160]   It's pretty cute.
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.880]   And makes the point that some things, the most important things you might have learned
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:21.040]   in kindergarten or not.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.880]   And the music street is very short and kind of fun.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.640]   I did, maybe you saw this before, maybe you do this.
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:26.640]   I did not.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.640]   Okay.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:28.640]   One more.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:29.640]   This is it.
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.640]   It's a good place.
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:31.640]   You sure?
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.640]   Final answer.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   Okay.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.640]   Stacey, come on.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:35.640]   Stacey, come on.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.000]   That was a dud.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000]   Music's trasse.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.960]   Oh, I've seen this before.
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:46.320]   They've got, they've got highway, you know, the little, and the shoulder of the highway
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:48.600]   together, little bumps, little warning strips.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:53.800]   So you go over and you go, you know, your car is off the road, except here in, this
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:59.480]   is apparently in Hungary, it's not just a.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:08.200]   Seems this would encourage people to trap off the road.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:16.160]   I'm also thinking of Kramer when he took over a mile abroad.
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.160]   Yeah, these are old.
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:18.160]   I've seen these before.
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:19.160]   Yeah, I've seen it before.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.160]   Never seen this.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.160]   Okay.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:22.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.160]   Well, you see, I learned something new every day.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.160]   There's nothing new on TikTok.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.160]   Nothing.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:31.560]   And the two put one in there.
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:36.000]   Quiet quitting is the latest workplace trend going viral on TikTok.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000]   It's like, you don't need to do that.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]   I thought I had put that in.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.240]   No, don't bother with that one.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:41.080]   So we've had quiet quitting.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.960]   We've had people quiet quit.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:47.400]   I'm quiet quitting right now.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:54.680]   Yeah, you see a bad add to terrible.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.280]   So terrible.
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:57.280]   No.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:58.280]   No, yes.
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.280]   No, yes.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.280]   No, I am.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.040]   Well, I was quite quitting during the TikToks.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:04.040]   I'll be honest.
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:05.040]   We're done.
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:06.520]   But we're done with the TikToks.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.760]   And now I'm back.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.840]   Let's do a change log.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.480]   Play that thing that you do so very well.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:15.880]   The Google change log.
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:26.600]   The official Android 13 version of Android is out.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:27.600]   Right?
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.400]   We said that already.
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.520]   This is the official statue.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:35.560]   It's not a dessert.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:36.560]   What is it?
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.280]   Is that a swing set?
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:40.000]   It needs lumey, I think.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.760]   It's a swing set.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.880]   It says, this is Android police.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.360]   Google's official Android 13 statue sure looks like a butt.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:56.760]   It's a swing set in the shape of three of a three triggers all the wrong suggestions.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:58.400]   Well, it's a swing set.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.760]   Swingsets always look like butts.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:01.440]   They have to fit your butt.
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.440]   That's not anything.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:03.440]   Wow.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.600]   This is on the Google campus.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:06.480]   I guess they're not doing desserts.
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:10.640]   Is there a dessert associated with Android 13?
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:13.040]   I think there is.
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:14.280]   I think there is.
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:17.880]   We used to make that like a top story of what's the dessert.
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:18.880]   Yeah, what's the dessert?
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.440]   I don't care.
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:24.240]   Was it Q?
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.240]   Q-R-S.
[01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:27.120]   Gosh, I don't even know anymore.
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:28.120]   Was it T?
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:29.120]   Turimasu.
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.120]   He says maybe Turimasu.
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:31.120]   Yeah, T.
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.120]   Okay.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:35.800]   That's a good, at least there's a decent dessert.
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:39.560]   I don't know why they didn't have a nice little piece of Turimasu in the sculpture park
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.560]   instead of a swing.
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:45.920]   A piece of Turimasu.
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:48.440]   Google Photo has made a change.
[01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:49.800]   I think this is very, very important.
[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:51.600]   I want you all to listen carefully.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:55.280]   They're renaming archive to hidden.
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.280]   What?
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.280]   They're renaming.
[01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.520]   You really want me to repeat it?
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:00.520]   I heard you.
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:01.920]   I don't understand.
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:03.720]   That's the change.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:10.600]   Archive, in fact, there is a prompt when you update Google Photos to 6.1 on iOS.
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:15.960]   You'll be greeted with archive is now called hidden.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.440]   So hey, it's a change and it's in the change lock.
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:24.480]   Google Chrome can now become your default browser on Windows.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.960]   Remember, this was, I don't know if you remember this.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.720]   It was certainly a conversation.
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:32.360]   For went on for a while on Windows Weekly, Microsoft really wants you to use their browser
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.240]   edge and had made it for a while.
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:38.840]   Very hard to change the default browser.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:41.400]   You know, a lot of buttons to click and so forth.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.560]   Well, Google Chrome is now rolling out the ability to become your default browser with
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.920]   one click.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:49.920]   I think Firefox tried this.
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:52.760]   Microsoft changed it than Fire.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:55.760]   But I think it's really Microsoft capitulating.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:05.000]   Y'all, did you see that Lorenzo Franceschi, the chatter, I don't know.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.800]   He was a journalist, so the Twilio attack was trying to attack journalists.
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:18.040]   Oh, so, at Lorenzo FB is the guy.
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:20.640]   On Twitter, I presume.
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:21.640]   Yes.
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:28.920]   So there might match up with your thesis that is an invitation.
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.920]   Oh, Lorenzo Franceschi Bikkiari.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.480]   There he is.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:37.280]   Yes, a real time historian of late cyber capitalist era at Motherboard.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:43.200]   Oh, he's a motherboard, which of course makes sense.
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:46.560]   They targeted 1900 signal users, specifically going after three of them.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:52.040]   I was one of the three and the hackers were able to take over my signal account for 13
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:53.040]   hours.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:55.760]   Yeah, I know, of course, his byline.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.920]   We see it all the time.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.480]   That's very interesting.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.280]   Oh, see, and he's saying to people, if you've talked to me during this timeframe, someone
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.280]   was impersonating me.
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:08.960]   I wouldn't understand who or what.
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:09.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:10.960]   Yeah.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:13.280]   He probably has sources who use signal.
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:15.320]   Expect this to be him.
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:20.800]   It could be actually, now that makes me think it's more industrial espionage kind of stuff,
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:21.800]   right?
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:24.400]   What is Lorenzo usually right about?
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:27.720]   Let's see.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:31.400]   I think the environmental activist trying to sabotage mining companies.
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:34.640]   Oh, so that could be a government.
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:40.400]   Yeah, head of Ukraine's cyber security says Russia has committed cyber war crimes.
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.240]   He writes about security.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.640]   Yeah, info second surveillance.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:45.840]   Oh, all right.
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:46.840]   Well, there you go.
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:48.840]   Sorry, I interrupted your change log, but it felt him.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.920]   No, that's important.
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.920]   That's good.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:51.920]   And that makes a lot of sense.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.640]   I knew it was a targeted attack.
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:55.200]   I didn't realize it was targeting journalists.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.360]   That's very interesting.
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.600]   Hey, guess what?
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:02.600]   Google Meet now shows how noisy your office is.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.600]   Huh?
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.600]   Huh?
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:10.520]   Well, you know, you don't want to take a video call in a noisy office.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:15.440]   Google has ambient noise suppression to block out the noise, but they've revealed in a
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:20.080]   post on the Google Workspace blog, there's actually a new visual indicator for when
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.160]   meat has activated that.
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:26.640]   So if you look here, you know, when you're talking, it's got the little waveform, but
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:29.760]   you see it'll say reducing noise.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:34.160]   So if you see reducing noise pop out, it means, hey, the dog is barking.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:37.280]   The dog is barking or something like that.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:40.760]   The pop up will appear as often as once per meeting.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:45.640]   Did you ever try Google Meet instead of Zoom?
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:46.640]   Did we, John?
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:47.640]   I don't think so.
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:48.640]   We use it for corporate.
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:51.640]   You use it for our staff meetings and stuff.
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:54.960]   And I think our experience is there in form of decision not to use it on the air.
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:58.560]   I think I would imagine that.
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:01.240]   You're going to have to explain this to me.
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:03.080]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:04.880]   Google is killing off.
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:07.000]   Oh, go ahead.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.960]   Google is killing its IoT core link between connected devices and its Google cloud platform.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:16.480]   Is that a big deal?
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:18.320]   Sounds like a big deal.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.520]   So they're giving you a year's notice.
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:26.920]   And basically, it's an indication that Google sucks when it comes to getting IoT devices
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:27.920]   onto their cloud network.
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:30.520]   They do have a few customers.
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.360]   There's a customer's individuals or companies that make IoT devices.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.720]   Companies that make IoT devices.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.880]   So this is, and specifically, it's industrial companies that are sending device data.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:46.480]   So IoT core is a data ingest off of different devices and modules.
[02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:50.480]   And you knew it wasn't popular because nobody making modules actually supported it.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:53.280]   They were like, yeah, we support Azure and AWS.
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.040]   And then, crickets, if you asked them about Google.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:59.680]   But it's still a big deal from a competition perspective.
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:03.400]   So Amazon and Microsoft both offer similar features.
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:04.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:07.840]   Microsoft is Azure IoT Hub and AWS IoT core.
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:10.080]   They're the two names of that.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:15.800]   Google went general variability with their cloud IoT core service, managed service early
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:21.160]   2018, unclear how many people used the service ever.
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:28.360]   And so they are killing it five years later, August 16, 2023, one year from yesterday.
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:29.360]   Yesterday.
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:36.640]   I figure, you know, small story, but ties into the don't love anything that Google produces.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:37.960]   It will kill it.
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:41.320]   Here's the quote for the stack.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:44.680]   Since launching IoT core, it's become clear that our customers' needs could be better
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:49.880]   served by our network of partners that specialize in IoT applications and services.
[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:52.200]   Don't use us.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:54.080]   You'll be better served by somebody else.
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:56.480]   They're not you.
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:57.480]   It's us.
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:59.440]   Well, you know, good on them.
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:04.200]   If something doesn't work well or people aren't using it, then that's completely appropriate.
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:09.680]   And that's why we're going to end the Google change log.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.680]   We're done.
[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:11.680]   It's over.
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:13.520]   We'll be back next week with more.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:15.440]   Don't worry.
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:18.880]   Let us pause for a moment.
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:22.880]   And when we come back, I'm going to put you all back to work with the final thoughts,
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:26.520]   your picks of the week.
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.480]   Let's kick off the picks of the week.
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:33.820]   And and again, no pressure with Stacy's thing.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.600]   My thing this week is not actually a thing.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:38.040]   It's an app.
[02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:43.640]   If you're like wondering, Oh my gosh, should I go for hearables or anything like that with
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:48.480]   the recent FTC decision, I'm using I use an app called the Mimi hearing test.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:53.880]   You can get an Apple and Android and it keeps a running you to a hearing test.
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:57.880]   However, many times you want and it just basically tracks your hearing.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:00.000]   How is your hearing?
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.040]   My hearing is OK.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.640]   I'm losing some high frequencies.
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:03.640]   Yes.
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:05.440]   That's because you're getting old.
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.440]   Thank you.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:11.040]   I've used this because I'm really old and I agree.
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:14.440]   This is really a very weird the hearing is all the time.
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:17.120]   Leo, no, I hear well enough.
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:21.880]   You know, I got them because I kind of wanted to understand the market.
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:24.120]   I wanted to understand.
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:30.280]   I was excited about the hearables category and I went to Starkey and Resound because
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:34.360]   both of them seemed to be kind of forward thinking that I was very underwhelmed.
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:37.120]   It really gave me insight into hearing aids and how.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.800]   Yeah, poorly they work.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:45.440]   So I wear my hearing is definitely deteriorating because too many years of headphones for one
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:46.440]   thing.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:47.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:49.880]   The New York Times just said that that is not a problem.
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:50.880]   What?
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:51.880]   Hearing?
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:52.880]   Earbuds.
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:53.880]   Earbuds.
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:55.320]   Earbuds don't hurt your hearing, they say.
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:57.840]   Well, if you don't listen to loud, I've been listening.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:02.520]   Look at, I've been wearing headphones for 46 years and probably too loud.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:07.680]   And the thing is it's a vicious cycle because you start turning them up and then it damages
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:09.560]   your hearing and then you turn them up some more.
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:12.280]   So you're always listening louder and louder and louder.
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.280]   I think that.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.160]   Like did you take them on the cruise?
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:16.160]   Here it is.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:17.160]   No.
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:18.160]   No.
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:19.160]   So you don't really wear them.
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:20.160]   Yeah, I don't wear them.
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:22.840]   Well, I did for a while.
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:25.040]   Occasionally if I know I'm going to be in an environment where it's going to be hard
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:26.760]   to hear I will wear them.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:29.880]   That's not, at least I ever say, "Dammit, Leo, would you wear your hearing aids?"
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:30.880]   Yeah.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:31.880]   Okay.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.400]   She mumbles.
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:39.760]   Maybe I should take this Mimi hearing test.
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:41.360]   So this is free.
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:44.600]   What do you get out of this though?
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:47.400]   I mean, it's just you just get the knowledge.
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.240]   You get the knowledge.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.120]   But like as these things are becoming more like you're going to see a lot more marketing
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:57.640]   towards people like, "Oh, can you hear this?"
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:08:58.640]   You couldn't.
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:08:59.640]   Oh my gosh.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.720]   Check out the new Jabra Enhanced Elite 22s.
[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:08.360]   So this is just an option that kind of offers you.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:14.360]   Some Android devices offer this kind of hearing test built in like the Samsung phones, which
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:20.360]   is fantastic because you can say, "Okay, and now when I play back sound on headphones
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:26.920]   and with this phone, I want you to adapt it to my equalization curve."
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:29.120]   So it's really, that's really good.
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:36.440]   I feel like Mimi also had a tinnitus app of some kind, but I guess not I'm looking to
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:37.440]   see.
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:38.440]   Tinnitus.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:40.520]   I say tinnitus.
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:42.280]   You say tinnitus.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:44.080]   Let's call the whole thing off.
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.080]   I know.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:47.960]   Let's figure out how to say that word.
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:48.960]   It's both.
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:49.960]   It's both.
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:50.960]   I asked my audiologist.
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:51.960]   Yeah.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:54.960]   I thought theitis was about inflammation.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:10:06.440]   My audiologist says tinnitus, but I think he said it's okay to say tinnitus.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.880]   What does Google say?
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:11.480]   That's because we've Americanized it apparently.
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:12.480]   Oh, really?
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:13.480]   Okay.
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.480]   You know, I don't know.
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:16.280]   I'm just talking outside of my neck.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:17.280]   Really?
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:18.280]   You got a hole there too?
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.320]   Anyway, I don't like it and I got it.
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:27.480]   And there are apps also that you can use to kind of mask it or figure it out or whatever.
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:30.000]   Tonight is pronounced tinnitus or tinnitus.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.200]   Yeah, both.
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.200]   Tinnitus.
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:34.280]   This is the national institute's.
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:35.280]   That's British.
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:36.280]   Hold on.
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.480]   Let me do the American.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:38.480]   Tinnitus.
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:44.040]   Well, according to the national institutes of health, it's pronounced both ways.
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:46.400]   And I think that's what my audiologist said as well.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.640]   And when I say tinnitus, which I agree with you and is the proper pronunciation, I get
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:51.640]   corrected so much.
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.280]   So I just say tinnitus now.
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:54.280]   Yeah.
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:56.080]   Because that's what people want to hear.
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.840]   So I tell them what they want to hear.
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:10:59.840]   Even if I can't hear it.
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:01.400]   Mimi health, it's free, right?
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:02.400]   On iOS.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:03.400]   It is.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:04.400]   On iOS.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:09.320]   If you have an Android device, you might look and see certainly Samsung has this buried
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.080]   deep in the sound settings.
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:12.520]   You can it's called a dap sound.
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:18.320]   You can adjust the sound of the phone to your particular hearing deficiencies.
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:22.520]   Uh, Jeff, should you buy a books?
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:24.320]   Well, that's one of my things.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.520]   But first I want to mention is we didn't get to one story.
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:29.040]   I want to just mention this just so I can say it.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:32.480]   I've been telling you and telling you and telling you an Australian court just agreed
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:35.320]   that Google is not a publisher.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.640]   It could not be held liable for libel by just linking to something.
[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:40.880]   I just wanted to get that on the record.
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:42.880]   That's all I would do that.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:46.000]   This is YouTube, uh, case.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.200]   I don't know.
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.200]   This is another case.
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:50.200]   It's really case.
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:51.200]   Yeah.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.640]   So I just want to mention that for the record.
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:56.320]   So I actually have a few questions for you for our wonderful audience.
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:01.000]   First the books, you know, I had the remarkable and I said it back because it wasn't the
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:06.480]   software at the time wasn't working well to fluidly move PDFs that I could mark up back
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:08.440]   and forth into my drive.
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:11.240]   Books is based on Android.
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:12.240]   Huh.
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:15.880]   And so I wonder whether or not that's a selling point.
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:18.920]   Which version of Android?
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:20.360]   Uh, love it.
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:26.040]   So these are the idea of these is these are E-ink notebook applications where you could
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:28.400]   put documents on them, mark them up or write your own notes.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.600]   I have the remarkable too.
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.360]   I quite like it.
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:34.880]   And I have not had the issue that you've had.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:35.880]   Maybe the software got better.
[02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:36.880]   Yeah.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:38.960]   I just, you know, you have an app that first once moves into the app.
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:40.200]   Yeah, I think it's pretty good.
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.960]   I don't know anything about the books.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.160]   Anybody know anything about the books?
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:44.160]   Be double.
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:47.400]   Well, what happens is we mention this on the show and then people come to Twitter and tell
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:48.400]   me what they think.
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.400]   Uh, yeah.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:50.400]   That was one.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:52.080]   Having Android could be good, of course.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.080]   It could be.
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:54.080]   It could be.
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:55.080]   Yeah.
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:56.640]   I mean, it's the tablet right then.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:57.640]   Right.
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:59.400]   It's just a E-ink tablet.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:04.280]   Um, so, you know, I, I, I mentioned this on the show a couple of times I have a few,
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.760]   not very many, very few shares of Twitter.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.880]   So I could get these kinds of notifications and I just got the, the, the should I vote.
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:16.680]   Now Twitter is saying that you should vote in favor of the Musk purchase.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:18.680]   Oh, as a shareholder.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.640]   Yeah, as a shareholder.
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:25.520]   We knew that the board would recommend it because essentially that's what they said,
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.520]   right?
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:28.360]   We're going to recommend it, but they don't really mean it.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:29.360]   Do they?
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:31.000]   Sure, they do.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000]   They want money.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000]   They're wireless.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000]   Don't paid.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000]   Yeah.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000]   But I think I should vote.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000]   No.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.000]   What do you think?
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.800]   For my user, I would vote no, but yes.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:44.880]   Twitter's stock is $43.99 right now.
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:47.840]   So you'd be getting almost a $10 share premium.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:50.560]   But what is free speech worthy worth?
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.440]   By the way, that's interesting because that stock has gone up quite a bit over the last
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:55.440]   month.
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:56.440]   Sure has.
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.200]   Indicating that the market believes, uh, that even if you're going to have to kick in some
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:05.600]   money or is going to have to buy it, I think more likely the former Elliot management, the,
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:12.640]   um, activist shareholders who were instrumental in getting Jack Dorsey to quit, uh, have now
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:14.640]   sold their entire stake in Twitter.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:15.640]   There out.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:16.640]   Shh.
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.400]   After, after really kind of messing up the whole company.
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:23.480]   They're just people who are like, yeah, I'll do this.
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:24.480]   Right.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.760]   Uh, so then finally I was going to mention that, uh, so I went back to the classroom
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:33.040]   today and today was my session on the history of media.
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.800]   And I do, um, the entirety of media from Gutenberg to today and 45 minutes.
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.640]   I was going to mention that I put it on YouTube, uh, from the last year's and you could watch
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:46.080]   it, but, but then I guess that if I did that, then Leo would fear that I'm going to take
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.080]   down the whole show.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.400]   So I won't mention that.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:54.000]   I'm not worried about you, but what about the journalism school?
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.480]   This is your 43 minute.
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.320]   Is this your, is this a lecture?
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:14:59.920]   Yes, it is.
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:02.840]   It's the entire history of media in 43 minutes.
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:03.840]   History of journalism.
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:04.840]   Wait a minute.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:07.000]   How do you get the whole history of journalism?
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000]   43 minutes.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.880]   Because I talk really fast.
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:13.240]   I had to listen to it again.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.080]   It's like what I turned myself on fast.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.400]   I scared myself.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:18.040]   Do you, uh, this is interesting.
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:21.240]   So this is now, I thought you said you were meeting in person and classes.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:24.280]   We did, but they, they cut down my time.
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:27.680]   So I had to get in the basics by showing them the video again.
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:28.680]   And then we could discuss it.
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.000]   Actually, I think it's a great idea to flip the, you know, they call it flipping the
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000]   classroom.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.080]   And have the discussion like prep them ahead of time and then have it.
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.760]   So watch this tonight.
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.320]   And then what the class really is going to be is us talking about what you, what you
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:43.520]   get out of it.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:44.800]   Is that kind of what you did, Jeff?
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:45.800]   Yeah.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:46.800]   Yeah, that's nice.
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:47.800]   Um, good.
[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:50.000]   So everybody can watch this.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.960]   We won't watch all 43 minutes.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:53.680]   Is there a highlight anywhere?
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:54.680]   No.
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:56.680]   Is there a TikTok?
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:03.600]   Um, and it starts your actual onto 45 TikToks next year.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:07.680]   Is it start with Gutenberg and ends with pipe course?
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.680]   Uh, I don't think I mentioned podcast.
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:11.080]   What did you mention?
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:12.080]   Sible.
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:14.920]   I was so sad that didn't do quibi.
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:16.680]   Did you mention quibi?
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:17.680]   No.
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:18.680]   Sible.
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:19.680]   What's sible?
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:20.680]   Oh, sible sible.
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:21.680]   Did that fail?
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:23.680]   That was the blockchain news thing.
[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:25.400]   No, I did not mention it.
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:27.400]   I knew better.
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.080]   I didn't realize it was, it was gone.
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:32.080]   Hmm.
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:34.280]   Lessons from a failed startup.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.320]   Civil was launched in 2017.
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:41.360]   Uh, maybe basing a blockchain wasn't this.
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:42.360]   Yeah, it was.
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.360]   It was so complicated.
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:44.360]   Oh my Lord.
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:46.560]   It was complicated.
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:52.520]   I think we've kind of learned a lesson about blockchain is not everything that's cracked
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:53.520]   up to be.
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:54.520]   Okay.
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:57.600]   Um, uh, how do people find this?
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.080]   It's on your YouTube channel.
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:00.880]   YouTube and search Jeff Jarvis.
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:09.960]   So YouTube.com/Jeff Jarvis and, um, skip the weird pixel XL to, well, that's old stuff.
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:13.040]   Go right to the J school.
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:15.360]   Actually, you put a lot of this on there.
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.000]   That's really cool.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.480]   I have one on business too.
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:21.000]   What's Jarvis Salisbury?
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.240]   I had to do a talk for somebody.
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:27.000]   When I search by Jeff Jarvis, I get, you get the jazz player music.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000]   Yes.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.480]   That's probably better.
[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:30.480]   Yeah.
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:32.480]   That's the talented Jeff Jarvis as opposed to me.
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:33.480]   Oh, I see.
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:37.520]   There's also on a journalistic code of ethics.
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:41.120]   There is also the Jeff Jarvis who is an Elvis impersonator.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.120]   Really?
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.120]   Yes.
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.120]   Wow.
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:45.120]   That also sounds fun.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:46.120]   Yeah.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:47.120]   As opposed to me.
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:50.240]   Oh, Jeff, but this is the Jeff Jarvis you want except no substitutes.
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:55.280]   In fact, Jeff, you should replace your thumbnail with this.
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.120]   This is a great picture I bought a show.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:58.120]   I should.
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:17:59.120]   Yeah.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:06.320]   Jeff Jarvis, entertainment at the bash.com/oldies/Jeff-harves.
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:11.080]   Do you think we can get him there?
[02:18:11.080 --> 02:18:12.600]   He's from Cumberland, Rhode Island.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.520]   We'll travel up to 100 miles.
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:15.520]   There you go.
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.800]   Up to 100 miles.
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:22.920]   So we're not going to get him, I guess.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.120]   Ant Pruitt, what's your thing?
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:27.720]   What are my...
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:28.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:29.720]   I had to switch it.
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:31.920]   It's your thing to what you want to...
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:37.520]   Shout out to Scott Hilt, I believe, on Twitter.
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:43.960]   Because I was just griping about Android 13 and Scott Hilt has done the work.
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:49.960]   He set the wallpaper to Clemson, Orange.
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:57.800]   And even though the original image had the proper orange, take a look at that left side.
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:00.920]   Look at those, the clock and that color.
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:04.040]   And if you scroll down a little more, you can see what actual palette.
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:10.160]   Oh, they want really like lime green chocolate brown and pewse.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:13.320]   I'm so sorry.
[02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:17.000]   Scott Hilt, thank you for sending that during the show.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.480]   He proved it.
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:19.480]   He proved it.
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:20.480]   And you know what?
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:23.760]   His Twitter motto is quality over quantity.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:24.760]   So there.
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:25.760]   I dig that.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.760]   Good call.
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:29.200]   Next, I just want to give a shout out to Miss Lisa Carney.
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:30.920]   I spoke with her over the weekend.
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:32.960]   It's good to talk to her.
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:35.160]   And she mentioned Photoshop World is coming up.
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:39.040]   It's Scott Kelby and Kelby One event.
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:41.320]   Right now, I believe you get it for $100.
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:42.320]   It's off.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:49.960]   It's all online and it's all of the legendary photographers and retouchers and processors
[02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:50.960]   of Photoshop.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:56.880]   It's going to give you a lot of information and help you get better at using it.
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:00.400]   Links in our show notes in this for Photoshop World.
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:02.520]   And lastly, just tag me on Instagram.
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:05.120]   I'm not going to say follow me on Instagram because you're not going to see it if you
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:06.120]   follow me.
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:13.200]   But just tag me on Instagram with any of your images that you've snapped or something that
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:14.200]   you found interesting.
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:18.840]   It's been cool seeing some of the stuff people tag me and a lot of good photographers out
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:19.840]   there.
[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:20.840]   It's not getting a recognition.
[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:25.120]   So tag me and underscore Pruitt and underscore Pruitt.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:30.280]   Give him a tag and then I should tag you with all my lopsided landscape photos.
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:36.080]   Do you take lopsided landscape photo commission?
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:42.720]   I will lopsided the heck out of any picture that I take.
[02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:44.720]   Last week's episode.
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:50.240]   That's the first thing that popped up in my feedback and didn't have to touch the horizon.
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:52.240]   It was awesome.
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:55.640]   This person has been watching the show for over a year and they're learning.
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:57.680]   So we're doing something right.
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:58.680]   Yay.
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:20:59.680]   Everybody should watch it.
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:04.400]   I will watch your show when you tell me exactly what I need to do.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:09.600]   So Google stops asking me to pick a better shot when I take the photo.
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:10.600]   It knows.
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:12.040]   It just knows.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:13.840]   How does it know?
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:15.000]   @pruit.tv/hop.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.840]   Hands on photography every week.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:25.040]   You should also by the way join our club twits so you can hang with Ant and the gang
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:30.720]   in our discord which is a wonderful place, a social place to hang out.
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:34.600]   Jeff even posts there occasionally as you can see.
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:37.160]   Stacey's got her book club coming up.
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:41.080]   We're going to be reading Clara and the Sun.
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:42.640]   I can't wait to talk about that.
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:44.080]   That's next week this week.
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:47.720]   Actually tomorrow Alex Lindsay doesn't ask me anything.
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:52.240]   Now these are available to everybody in the club but that's not the only benefit of being
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:53.240]   a club twit member.
[02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:56.960]   In fact we thought the whole thing would be about getting ad-free versions of our show.
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:02.120]   So seven bucks a month, all the shows we do ad-free.
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:06.640]   You also get access to the discord and the twit plus feed which includes shows that we
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:11.800]   don't release to the general public because we don't yet have the audience or the advertisers
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:12.800]   to pay for it.
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:14.240]   So club twit members pay for it.
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:19.200]   That includes the brand new hands on windows with Paul Thorett, Mike Asargent's hands on
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:20.200]   Mac.
[02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:22.880]   The untitled Linux show Jonathan Bennett.
[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:25.680]   We also have the Giz Fizz, Stacey's book club.
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:29.200]   There's a lot of stuff going on and they discord all the time.
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:33.560]   Again you get individual feeds for all those shows as well if you're a member.
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:35.680]   So go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:38.040]   It really helps us out.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:42.160]   I can't thank you enough the club twit members.
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:49.800]   You know made it so much fun to be in the club but also it really helps us financially.
[02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:51.080]   Keep things on.
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:57.000]   I asked yesterday on Twitter just are you part of club twit because I was curious just who
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:01.840]   that follows me as part of club twit and man that thread is still going.
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:02.840]   Oh good.
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:07.920]   Thank you all so much for being a part of club twit really does.
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:09.360]   Warm my heart I know.
[02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:14.600]   And people you know I people know we're ad supported but you know we only had two ads
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:15.760]   this week for instance.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:22.080]   I mean the ads come and ads go and times are getting tougher during covid was you know
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:25.600]   when we really started to struggle a little bit and that's why we started club twit.
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:30.880]   But it gives us you know when we have a surplus the wherewithal to do additional shows like
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:33.400]   hands on Mac hands on windows and so forth.
[02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:39.440]   So thank you very much for supporting twit.tv/clubtwit.

[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:27.300]   Thank you Jeff.
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:28.300]   The following.

[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:30.300]   Ant-prruit.
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:33.060]   We already mentioned hands on photography.
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:34.300]   Thank you for being here.
[02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:35.300]   You're the best.

[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:41.480]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:42.480]   Thanks for watching.
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:43.480]   Have a great week.
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:44.480]   Bye bye.
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:50.600]   Hey I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astor magazine and each week I'm joined by Tarek Malek, the
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:53.320]   editor in chief over at space.com.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.680]   In our new This Week in Space podcast, every Friday Tarek and I take a deep dive into the
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:59.840]   stories that define the new space age.
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:01.000]   What's NASA up to?
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.640]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:05.800]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:07.240]   When do those come on?
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:09.460]   What the heck has Elon Musk done now?
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:13.040]   It addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration will take an occasional
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:17.380]   look at bits of space flight history that you probably never heard of and all with an
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:20.100]   eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:21.620]   Check us out on your favorite pod catcher.
