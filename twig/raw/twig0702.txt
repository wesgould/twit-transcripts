[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.480]   Yes, I am
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.640]   Follically challenged and it's cold in here
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.040]   Yeah, only one here and I refuse to turn on the heater in the house if I'm known
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.320]   I know I have total sympathy after shaving my head a few years ago. I
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.240]   Realize yeah, the hair actually keeps you warm. It's like a hat. I'm always wearing a hat makes a difference sir
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.480]   Glad to be here appreciate you having each and every week Jeff Jarvis is here. He's a professor
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.280]   Leonard towel professor as it would be as it was it should be professor of journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:09.160]   Graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York we should get pigeons cooing
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.960]   Craig and honor of Craig. I think pigeons guy
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   I think you know you can
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.200]   A pigeon rescue place visited him
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.760]   There's great pictures of Craig with pigeons on him
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.160]   I think we should you should have a pet pigeon on the show deal a pet pigeon
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.440]   On the show I would climb pigeon our orange
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.080]   Oh Craig might not appreciate that
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.000]   Also with a stacy Higg and Bathum from Stacy on IOT.com hello Stacy with her Frida Kahlo robot shirt
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.840]   That's right. Did the robots have unibrow what makes them Frida Kahlo?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.440]   They just look Frida Kahlo. They kind of they don't have actually they don't have eyebrows. Maybe they're not at all
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.080]   Yeah, okay. I got nothing. There's robots whatever floats your boat
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.480]   You know else is here because we wanted to talk about something that's just coming out
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.920]   on the Kickstarter
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.480]   Our good friend Glenn Fleischman is here. Hello Glenn
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.560]   Oh, hey, oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey, you told us last time you were on about this book
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.200]   You've been working on with Marson Wishery. It's how you say his name. It's uh, let me work on it
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.480]   It's uh, Marcin Wishery Marcin Wishery. He's written from Poland. Yeah, I live in the United States for decades now
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.520]   It's called written as first book. Oh, it's like it's a gift
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.120]   Happens what a first book it is
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.440]   But you can get in on the Kickstarter, right?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.040]   That's right. We launched yesterday. So I should point he's the author of the book
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.280]   I'm the editor and project manager and bottle washer and midwife of the thing and so we've been planning for literally years
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.720]   launched it yesterday and it is
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.400]   Well over $400,000 what oh yes, and you don't need to be on anymore. Thank you
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.400]   And well, it's people like typewriters and keyboards. That's the two hour chat with Marchingan
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.040]   Yesterday, yeah, it was just great yesterday. Wonder. Oh, I missed it. I didn't know about it
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:21.720]   So you are already I mean 282 percent funded. Yeah, so I guess one day in but that but you know what?
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.280]   No, now we're not doing it for money
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.720]   We're doing it because we know you would be interested in this you are listeners a history of keyboards from early typewriters to modern
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.520]   mechanical marvels
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.840]   It's gonna be it's beautiful production. It's lip covered
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.600]   two volumes
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.300]   Is this four color? It's beautiful or color beautiful not only four color, but stochastic
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.800]   Parents or what is it like?
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   Circastic screening that's good though. Like it's yeah uses a it's a relatively so since like you're all put on my printing history at
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.660]   Since the 1800s when photographic methods were introduced into
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.400]   newspaper
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.200]   Reproduction the half tone screen has been the way that you take a continuous tone photograph
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.680]   And you turn it into collections of clusters of dots that fool our eyes into thinking their tones
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.640]   Well, the new thing is stochastic screening which has been kicking around for a couple decades
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.400]   But it's really been refined about 10 years ago and it's like dithering
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.000]   We all remember dithering from you know like Mac paint art and so forth
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.560]   It's like dithering but it's like dithering times a thousand so it's very very fine clusters of dots and
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.800]   You know if you look at the so we printed this is a press test that we made into a keepsake
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.920]   We sent out to a few people like Jeff and Leo maybe and so there's pages like this that have what feels like a solid orange
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:47.200]   Gradation and it's all dots because they are really close with your eyes. I can't see the dots now
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.080]   That's a printing. Yeah, it's like pointillism. It's a little bit like that. It's a little bit like that for sure
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.720]   It's like little tiny shapes, but they're so small that you can't perceive them
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.040]   So you get what look like solid colors
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   So one of the things we're doing is there's like the footnotes and so forth
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.800]   There's tiny orange footnotes and normally you'd use a spot color you have to use its own ink and we're using the process colors
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.480]   It's cyan to yellow is how you print and plus black is how you print for full color in most cases
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.080]   And you separate out color images into those colors and you get the result. So this is I don't know
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.880]   It's an amazing little process. It's so beautiful. Here's some images that you sent us as part of the press kit
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.520]   So that people can see I mean this is going to be
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.700]   It's it's it's something you're gonna want to put on your shelf
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:42.920]   Yeah, it's it's small though. It's it's a it's a it's a we're calling it's like an it's like a coffee table book
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:50.720]   But it's how big is my head it's like seven by ten inch size by ten inch instead of but it's gonna weigh like four pounds
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:57.440]   of four three and a half pounds volume we try to get it down, but the volume one is so it's two volumes volume one is
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.040]   kind of analog keyboards as the typewriter keyboards from their start and
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:09.240]   What's and then you probably to is more digital. It's like keyboards attached to digital things and all the way through mobile
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.320]   But what the book is really about is about the stories of people
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   So it's technology told through a human lens as opposed to here's the model and long lists
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.480]   And so you find out what an absolutely cranky person Christopher Scholes was who is mostly responsible for the first
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.640]   typewriter that went into production the Scholes and Glidden it's usually called that guy could not stop
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.400]   He is never satisfied could not stop inventing
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.920]   He just kept tinkering at the thing and even when he and Glidden managed to sell it to Remington which put it into production in the
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.840]   1880s
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.600]   Scholes is like I'm not satisfied
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.480]   He just kept working on the thing until his death
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.540]   This kept making new models and prototypes and insisted he had better than one else's ice is like a court
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:56.000]   He's fine for us. We'll just use court for the next 150 years. That's all right. You know here's your souls fancied himself kind of the rescuer women
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.400]   By creating and there's I have this great print in my computer of of with angels and shows of
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.320]   Him thinking that he he rescued women from drudgery work to work in offices with drudgery work. Yes
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:16.280]   Now they're typing instead exactly exactly. I would rather type something than run laundry through a mangle
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.760]   Here is actually a collection of six keyboards that Stacy has pounded on
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.480]   Like my keyboard you're right
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:33.920]   This is an example of different kinds of switches computer keyboards use
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.280]   You know you tapped into something if you'll forgive the pun because that's terrible
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:46.100]   Because they're there's something about computer folks and I think I'm kind of among the group where we're just really
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.660]   Fascinated by keyboards. We we buy expensive
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.280]   keyboards a
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   broad variety of them
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.840]   This is just very so he's been where he was a design he is a design manager at Figma
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.720]   So he's been a designer at medium and Google and so forth
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.560]   But obviously he's been collecting these images and these this information for many many years
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.200]   Yes, goes back. He somebody Andy Beow
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.380]   Who's one of the first CTO at Kickstarter and runs the XO XO conference and waxy.org
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.080]   I see links
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.840]   Generally interesting and lovely fella and he posted a message on Mastodon
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.640]   Sing pointing out to Marchin that he'd started in 2015 when he posted a tweet that said
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.520]   I should write a book about and have a bunch of pictures and Marchin did not remember that he thought he'd started a year later
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.480]   They literally said I should write a book about it
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.760]   So that's the left-hand tweet and the right-hand tweet is and now it's on Kickstarter and it's fun. Nice
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.760]   It's pretty exciting. I mean I have my stake in this
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.920]   I really want this to be good, but it's lovely to support an author like this is his
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.720]   Project and I'm so you know delighted to help bring it to
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:56.160]   Permission, but you know I've got a background in printing and a bit of fast-typer since I was 11
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.840]   I taught myself to type because my dad said you know typing might be useful. That's all right. That was right
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:07.840]   Well, you're the perfect person to edit this it will be released in October of this year
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.280]   If you want the book, it's a hundred twenty five dollars or more for the early
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.440]   Until only until when yeah
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.740]   9 a.m. On February 9th, so I'm not gonna lay unless you're watching live. Don't don't delay
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.860]   It is a two volume
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.080]   1,216 page hardcover book inside a custom slipcase
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.520]   Yes, it will be more expensive if you don't rush
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.680]   to kickstarter and search for shift
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.400]   happens
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.720]   Congratulations, though, 2,500 backers
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.240]   We just hit the number this second. Thank you very much. Yeah
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.840]   Really good news Glenn. Thank you for coming on
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.240]   I just wanted everybody to know about this and give them a chance to get in on the early bird
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.480]   I'm sure before it was too late. It's it ends the early bird ends tomorrow. Yeah tomorrow
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.040]   Yeah, those of you watching the show next week
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   Use a way back machine or watch live
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.200]   And you have till March 9th to get in on a Kickstarter
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.240]   Fully funded good news
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:17.840]   Wild if you do you have stretch goals if you get past the base mount is there we have some we have some ones
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.960]   We're hinting at you know, it's funny because Kickstarter technically doesn't they don't encourage or discourage stretch goals
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.880]   This is this is the biggest pick star of it's Kickstarter. I've been involved with personally, but I've done a bunch of
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.680]   campaigns and it's interesting to figure out what motivates, you know, it's kind of like the unseen hand of the market plus the amount of
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:42.160]   Love and respect you established among people turned into like a gumball machine and you're like all right
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.520]   I put it all in there how many people are gonna turn the knob and gumballs come out and
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.680]   So we set we had some loose ones. We actually are gonna add a third volume
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:56.240]   That's gonna include kind of a little bit about how the books made the printed form of the index so this will have a 1200 page book
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.240]   We squeezed everything we couldn't do the two volumes the index was sort of going to be maybe digital only but now
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.880]   Point it is will print the index in the third volume that'll also go in the slipkits
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.480]   Don't print up the profits keep the profits go on. No, no, this all we all very carefully carefully
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   So glad I I so
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.080]   The book I want to write next I'm writing a different book right now with what I really want to know
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.680]   Right as you know is the history of the line of type. Yeah, and so you aspire me
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.360]   I was thinking well, what would it be like? I'm not gonna make some of these as as gorgeous and
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.320]   Or Nate is this and I was trying to think about just the basic
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.200]   Economics of a book if you sold a book for 20 bucks not a hundred and five bucks
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.320]   With print costs and such what's a
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.620]   What's a critical mass look like for a lower priced thing on Kickstarter e-think?
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.640]   Well, it's interesting because you could I mean, you know, this is something I could unfortunately go on for several hours
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.760]   But I promise not to but it's there with the really economics winds up is being kind of shipping and binding
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.320]   So if you're willing to ship only to the United States
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.800]   It's very easy to ship and you can get a very predictable price and the only tax you owe is typically in the state
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.040]   You're shipping from two people in the state you're shipping from with some exceptions, you know
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.160]   But but you know if you're shipping overseas, we found I've shipped a lot of things overseas
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.920]   I've done some projects that have shipped hundreds or thousands of items outside the United States and
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.080]   Those prices used to be more predictable
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.600]   But now you have to pay excessive amounts of money and then the people get them may have to pay from 10
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.720]   to we heard 27.5% VAT on the imported item that we can't really collect it ahead because we there's you know
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.800]   200 countries and we'd have to have arrangements with each of them so they have to pay the shipper
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.960]   Um, so the way to do a book really affordably is you you settle probably on black and white or black plus one other color
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.840]   You do a self cover or not self cover rather
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.800]   But a soft cover book with perfect binding so it's a glued on the side instead of sewn
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.480]   And you ship only to the u.s
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.440]   And if you do all that, you know, you are reducing your worldwide audience
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.960]   So you're reducing the scope of who you can sell to but you reduce the complexity and you also open yourself up to
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.000]   Hundreds of more printers who could handle it. So we there's a very specialized group of printers
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.920]   In the u.s and more around the world who can do a hardcover a hardbound book affordably in full color and um, so that's kind of the secret is like
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.440]   u.s only
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   uh, perfect bound so glued binding
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.760]   Softcover, but who wants that I want sewn in sick. Well, that's the thing
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   I want a nice yeah, yeah
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.680]   There's I mean that's the thing right so that's why i went a book
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.840]   Why for the custom opened a bunch
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:35.280]   Pages start falling out because the perfect binding glue releases and now you've got just a pile of paper
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.960]   I don't that's exactly. I mean the sewn stuff for you if you want a book that lasts
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.600]   Uh, I I told marching and I believe it that I think uh, this is the most exhaustive book clearly
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.440]   It's ever been written about keyboards. Oh, yeah
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.720]   Might be the most exhaustive ever because who would do this again?
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   Right
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.680]   A contribution seven years of my life to write another thing like this the watch. I already wrote it
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.280]   What okay, so before we let you go what keyboard do you use?
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:06.080]   What's like I use the uh, matais uh quiet. I think it's called a quiet touch and I think I go through
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   Uh, this is no discredit to matais because I love their keyboards, but I type like a million, you know, I'm like staciems
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.200]   on my keyboard also a thousand
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:21.200]   Key you know keystrokes a minute or whatever and uh, so I've gone through I think I've owned six or seven matais
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.920]   Like the tactile pro the quiet pro
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.440]   Um over since they started uh, so I used to love the apple that um fantastic extended
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.280]   Keyboard and matais bought as I recall the key molds from
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.760]   the company uh
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.560]   So that they could make them as their first when they started making keyboards
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.440]   They had a put an order and think for a million keycaps
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.720]   And they managed before kickstarter to get enough pre-orders
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.880]   To put the dye injection mold order in and that's I know it's at 20 years ago now
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.360]   So, um, I just I run through them when I say run through them every three to five years
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.880]   I have destroyed the keyboard my my alien-like acid
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.680]   Of my fingertips has worn down all the keys and I got to get a new one and it's a great tax
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.520]   It's like my 20 dollar a year tax to get a new keyboard every few
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.600]   Ties was a sponsor for a long time. I have a lot of nice. Yeah, and I would never have their keyboards
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.680]   Uh, and I love them all I actually
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.200]   We were talking before the show about quiet typing versus loud typing and as much as I don't like the short travel
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   Uh keyboards for on air. I have to use them because they don't make any noise
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.480]   Um, but I love it. I love I could make them make noise
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.600]   Ties
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   Scream with every touch
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.560]   No
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   Because he has coming off now and I
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.720]   I suspect that stacy did that so I'll tell a story about the uh, do you remember karaeloo who is a lovely uh
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:47.360]   Technology writer wrote a lot of Mac stuff. He passed away. Yeah. Oh, yeah, so karae wonderful fell lived up here in seattle died about
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.680]   20 something years ago now kara came in my office one day and he sees a keyboard in
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.600]   The garbage he said why do you throw that out this before electronics recycling? I'm sorry
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.800]   This is 90 something 96 and I said the cue key stopped working
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.240]   He said why would you throw out a perfect good keyboard just put the cue on the clipboard and paste on the space to when you need
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   Just paste it in whenever you need a cue
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.440]   I'll put you to cute and he took it and I'm sure he used it
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.440]   Wow
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.760]   Isn't that the best that's the perfect karaeloo?
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.800]   All right, actually
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.200]   Everybody here except for you and me and makes their living typing right so uh, I think that this
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.320]   So, how do you what do you use stacy?
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.080]   What do you bang?
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.640]   um
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.360]   My
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.920]   Yeah, my bang my banger is just this ancient microscop or microsoft ergonomic keyboard. Oh, yeah, those are good
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.960]   I mean actually yeah my I mean and then I
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.640]   I want to design I have my little cherry kit to pick my but
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:49.440]   I can't tell which one and then I get a little OCD about it and a little lot of anxiety
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.440]   So I can't choose isn't it? Yeah
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.640]   Well in the little key things I got to type my type
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.040]   I got to type on the whole thing. Yeah, I can't just type on like one key. That's not helpful
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.480]   Anyway, the good is is the tire stuff like the people really into it now cherries old hat
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.720]   There there's I know there's key kron and other there's new companies doing keycat keys that switches and stuff
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.960]   The metias tactile pro. I think you would like are using a mac okay
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:20.720]   Yeah, and I need it but I need it like I was looking at they don't have an or they have a split ergonomic
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.320]   Which I do have an ergonomic effects like you know what um, I will package up my ergonomic
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.200]   I have it and I don't use it because it's too weird. I can't but I will package it up and send it
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   Are you gonna send me another e-reader
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   I
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.880]   Saying there won't be
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.680]   Some pictures in the book of those, you know the history of ergonomic keyboards
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.400]   I used to use some split ones and then I my hands changed even though I had some real problems
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.720]   And eventually when it sort of cleared up for between acupuncture and a bunch of other stuff
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.640]   I went back to a normal keyboard and I've been able to use it, but I have the kind you know
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.320]   There's there's ones that look like globes
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.040]   There's like the ones that you can rotate and split apart and angle and have amazing stuff
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.000]   I don't remember what kind I have but it looks like this
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.680]   Stacey and I will I will find it. Yeah the little split
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.240]   You know if you hate them you can put them together, but it's
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.320]   No, it's so horrible. I will send it to you. I will send it to you
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.120]   I do this
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.320]   They should put together an ergonomic and try to get attention for his keyboard
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.480]   Show us your keyboard aunt mine is just the I love this thing
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.040]   Unfortunately the batteries get on week, but this is the logic tech and its keys. That's a great
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.840]   Quiet
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.320]   I got that and I had to give it to my kid. I hated that keyboard zero travel
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.600]   It's like oh
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.560]   But I think though I have the mx set and I like that a lot
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.920]   But I think more and more of us especially those who type a lot
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.240]   Are switching to those big mechanical hard hi-tra, right?
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.360]   I travel yes. Yeah, I just use mine for shortcuts and yeah
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.800]   I'm like room and premiere and stuff. So how about you?
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.480]   Jeff, what do you use? Oh, I just my my you don't care what else yeah
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.440]   Oh
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.880]   Like no, I'm just like oh you're poor little
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.320]   Really?
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.440]   He's like an atheist in the church. He's an atheist in the church of keyboards
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.200]   She's whatever who here is a touch typist
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.280]   Who here is a touch type? Well, we know plan is yeah, that's all two of us. Oh, 40 43 years
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:26.720]   It's like oh, okay. Well, you I don't look at my what is touch typing even me. Do you use the right fingers on the right letters?
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.160]   See, I'm sure you don't know I I'm sort of
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.920]   I'm all the fingers and I don't look I don't need to look at it
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.760]   But I'm not a like a
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.880]   By the book touch type
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:43.520]   I think the question you have to ask nowadays is who's trained and who's not because we all to some degree or other a touch typing because we just do it so much
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.680]   But if you're trained and you know that you're the home row and you put your fingers in the right position and all that stuff
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   Yeah, I took class
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.760]   I took class and had a typing tutor on the computer at my maybe speak
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   Is it Mavis vegan? Mavis vegan?
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.080]   There's a chapter Mavis speaking in the book. Is there?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.680]   There's a touch typing. Yeah, absolutely
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.000]   Not you know, she's a model from the original person was a model from
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.920]   Dominican she was from the camera and she sort of disappeared like no one knows where she wound up
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.040]   I mean not like as insidious, but they know they lost track of her
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:22.240]   But yeah, Mavis speaking has been a terrific chapter on that and there's also touch typing was originally like witchcraft
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.680]   Like people didn't believe when typewriters. I imagine if there was never a keyboard
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.280]   And then suddenly you have a keyboard and people are like I can type without looking down and people like what is wrong with you?
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.280]   That's not the right way to type
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.400]   And look at them
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.520]   All the all the original type is what you typed blind so you actually didn't see what you typed the the keys hit down
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.240]   Below the the platinum so you're like the
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.960]   Or sorry, oh, right there hit right onto the platinum onto the paper that was on the platinum
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.080]   So you couldn't see until you were done typing what you typed
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.360]   Um, so people are like you can't touch typing to be looking at your keys
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.000]   It's very important and there is also a theory that everyone would stop eventually
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.040]   Making typos that you would that typos were a problem of training and not being a human being and i'm like
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.760]   What a wild thing but when it was new who knew you're like well, we'll all be perfected
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.520]   We'll perfect a teaching technique and then no one will ever type the wrong key again
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.000]   Uh, I failed to be to even get into journalism school to like take the fun
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.600]   The one-on-one classes we had to take a typing test which was really oh man crazy
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.800]   This was let's see. I went to my like 1996
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.000]   So i'm like sitting there and I failed it twice before I managed to pass the typing test
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.520]   This was a lot of the original type
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.040]   Pissacing it was the hostility to the keyboards exactly that you've lived with ever since
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   I got it now. I got it
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.280]   Glenn, thank you so much for coming by oh such pleasure everybody should go to kickstarter

[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:41.680]   In the enterprise segment melissa one of the things that's amazing about melissa. They've been around since 1985 and for a long time
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   But they don't rest on their laurels
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:50.400]   They or their or their rewards. They're always improving for instance. They have now added id
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.040]   identity verification technologies
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.800]   Both through acquisitions and developments on their own that are make that makes melissa even more important to have

[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.320]   It could cause real problems in your business
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.440]   This is just one more way melissa can protect you
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.240]   Poor data quality cost organizations a lot of money up to 15 million dollars a year
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.800]   And of course the longer bad data stays in your system the more losses you can accumulate
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.520]   Melissa helps you eliminate waste and lost opportunities for incorrect mailings
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.600]   Helps you improve customer satisfaction with seamless real-time identity verification tools
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:36.720]   They can do matching and deduplication which lets you establish a single high quality customer record
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.720]   Linking all those customer touch points. So when your customer service rep gets online with a customer
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.160]   They have all of the previous contacts all the information in one place
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.600]   Everybody needs this, you know how

[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.400]   That happens everywhere melissa can solve that
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.480]   problem
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.960]   And now working in compliance with the United States postal services move update requirements
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.760]   Melissa can assure the most current address data through processing in the usps is national change of address database

[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.880]   I watched it. I watched it. I did I first suggested I I stupidly sent an email to leo and jason sai
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.480]   Oh, you're gonna cover the google search event and then I saw what time it was and I said no
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:01.520]   Very grumpy. So we are in a space race, baby. This is this is like going to the moon. That's exciting
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.160]   Microsoft uh, well
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.280]   Microsoft's partner open ai
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.960]   And I can't even say they started you know really started it
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:18.960]   Open ai put out dolly to their image generation engine and then the folks is stable diffusion run way said hold my beer
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:24.640]   And came out with stable diffusion, which was open source. You could run it on your own computer generated amazing images
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.000]   Along comes mid journey and others suddenly there's a
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.360]   Just a huge parking
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.000]   Google barked a lot and said
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.880]   Huge explosion in image generated ai then open ai same people who did dolly too came up
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.720]   released chat gpt and that blew people's minds
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.920]   And then microsoft said yeah
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.920]   We did that
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.440]   microsoft one of many copies including heel on musk who put in money microsoft put in a billion dollars to get open ai
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.480]   Started and announced last week. They're gonna put another 10 billion dollars in and they're gonna start including
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.520]   chat gpt in their office. They had an event yesterday in which they announced
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.080]   They're gonna put chat gpt in their being search engine
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   Which was an all hands alert
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.080]   For google, right? This is the one threat. This is the one thing that could
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.080]   topple google's search, you know hegemony say well google's certainly worried about it
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.720]   Every microsoft is invited every
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.880]   Influencer in there's joanna stern from the wall street journal
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.040]   Somebody just sent me a video from iJustine
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.720]   Who just by coincidence, I guess was at the microsoft campus
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.680]   when microsoft
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:54.640]   Just by chance just around the corner from south l.a. Yeah happen to be up there and uh, you know
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.200]   She posted this on youtube. I gotta say I don't see anywhere
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.080]   Sponsored content or anything like that
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.840]   I am at microsoft right now and they just announced something so incredible
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.960]   That's basically gonna change the way that we search the internet
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.360]   So this is an ad
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.160]   Not build is an ad and I don't know if she got paid or not. I doubt
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.880]   I don't know
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:23.360]   I don't know it's a wall suspicious joanna stern for the walls at least joanna was covering it for the wall street journal, right?
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.480]   Uh, but did a similarly, you know
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.280]   This is gonna change everything
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.560]   Interview with the such in a della where they are is
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.640]   Gonna completely change what people can expect from search. They're grounded in the fact that you know
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   So there's a lot of hype around this. Yeah, let's report
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.440]   this
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:52.880]   Why is this is are people so hyped up about AI in search because my little simpleton thought of
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.440]   Need doing a quote unquote google searches
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.480]   I'm typing into a text field of something that I'm looking for and it's going to return a list of stuff
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.080]   That's probably going to be what I'm looking for within the first three or four entries usually, right?
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.680]   um
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.600]   What more do I need from that? Why do I need AI to step in and make this a better experience?
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   Why should I get hyped up about this stuff?
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.040]   Stacy jeff you want to answer or should I?
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.000]   Is that is that a punter? Is that a
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:33.360]   Answers no because my my dog is making hold on
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.160]   A sec
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.440]   I'll tell you why it makes headlines and stuff and this it seems really really sensational
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.920]   But I'm like it's it's search. What what what does the common person that's just looking for some information?
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:55.360]   Will they get excited about this or why would they get excited about it? Well, let me ask they will never know let me ask
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   My niva my the challenge the search engine that I use
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.960]   Right the private one the that's not private. You just pay five bucks for a month one
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.320]   Oh
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.800]   Yeah, I guess if you have to pay for although I think there's a free
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.800]   tier
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.040]   Um, but let me ask it why use
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   AI in search maybe it will have an opinion if they've been doing before anybody else
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.720]   Oh, we weren't able to generate an area I summary for you because there are not enough pages or facts to answer it
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.560]   By the way, that is no, you know what that's doing what it's supposed to do. I'm looking. Yeah, I like
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.880]   Uh, let me search for something. Uh, let's see is clemzen
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.520]   All that in college football
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.480]   This is where you need a good
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.720]   Football-y
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.040]   This is one. We're not able to generate a summary because there aren't enough pages or facts
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:56.720]   Okay, so yours is not great, but the idea is you have natural
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.920]   Who's the best in college football?
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:05.840]   Let me let me just ask you something I can answer nothing to say Georgia never mind give you rankings never
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.680]   rankings
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.120]   Okay, this is not a good answer. Obviously. I was hoping the chat gpt could answer for itself
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.800]   But I think it's here's the real advantage of it and the reason I by the way, I am now all in on neva
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.120]   I don't use google anymore. Uh, yes, you have to pay for it, but that means there's no ads
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.080]   Uh, and I think the results are just as good as google and I like the AI
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.040]   Because here's why often now when you go to google or anywhere you you get a knowledge
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   Graph that shows you
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.640]   You know a piece of text that kind of answers your question google's always said people don't do search
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.320]   Because they want to click a link to go to a website they do search because they want the answer to a question
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.360]   So why don't we just give them the answer and then we can put the wall street journal out of business
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.080]   and uh
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   This is kind of the idea is
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.440]   chat gtp gpt on bing or whatever neva's using I don't think they're using chat gpt
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.400]   But it's very similar a conversational text chat engine is is one thing
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.560]   It's really good is synthesizing information from a variety of sources
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.880]   So if what you say is what I really want is the answer not a link you're gonna get links
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.360]   But what I want is the answer
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:23.520]   Uh something that can go and look at three or four articles synthesize it and create a short synopsis for you may well be exactly what you're looking for
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:30.800]   And so the idea of checking multiple sources so the idea of checking multiple sources and and trying to
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.040]   bring the
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   summation giving you an answer
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:40.080]   No, it's it's it's like it's basically like if you asked me to explain something to you like
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:47.520]   Why does what does this matter and then I went to four different or three different or however many places I could find that talk about
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.280]   This topic
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:56.000]   I come back and I say and this is important because it allows you to get multiple sources into one succinct answer
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.800]   Which is what most people want here? Let me show you a good example. I wanted to know what is a cyclotron
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.160]   So I said how does a cyclotron work and the AI?
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.000]   generated
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.320]   Coming from uh wikipedia nasa
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.400]   By juice.com and vadantu.com and it footnotes those
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.280]   A description of what a cyclotron does how it works what you get out of it
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   And this is the kind of thing if you asked a kid in eighth grade to write a paper
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.760]   That's the paper right yeah, but if you're looking for the other sighting there
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.560]   Yeah, and it's cited and you can now still go to the links right and there's youtube videos and all that stuff
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.320]   But I like the idea that there often a quick answer
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.440]   Synopsizing a number of sources is really what you want from a search and that's what I think
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.360]   It's just it's like giving you wikipedia. It's it's snippets on steroids
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.400]   Because yeah, you're not driving any traffic to the new york times of the wall street journal or anything else
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.240]   You're just taking it and if you go to bing.com right now the promo box under the aspian
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.960]   Anything will give you their example
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.640]   I need to throw a dinner party for six people who are vegetarian. Can you suggest a three course menu with a chocolate dessert?
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.560]   Nobody's gonna take that in not by the way. That's right right?
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.040]   Normal people are searching for that
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.240]   Okay, but here's here's what we talked about we actually talked about this in our show
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.680]   There's a company called josh.ai that does its own custom voice engine for smart home
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.800]   Use cases imagine asking your smart home or your digital assistant
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.480]   Hey
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.280]   Give me a three course meal for vegetarians
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.160]   And then you know send it to my phone or whatever, but it could actually do that so
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.760]   What we do it yeah
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.760]   Yeah, well it makes more sense to be able to ask it via voice
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:50.880]   I guess it could tell you but then you also want it to send it to some sort of display or keeper
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:58.160]   I like for that particular thing and I I would think most of them because you're gonna get a more exhaustive answer. I would say
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:05.280]   Leo, I have a theory having watched the google thing which we're not on it yet. I but oh there's no Leo
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.680]   Um
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.680]   See i'll bet i'll bet you know
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.280]   um
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.080]   What besides search is amazon
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.320]   By the way, I just broke down the fourth wall. I wasn't supposed to tell you that I wasn't supposed to
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:23.280]   We can see each other now. So I blew it. I'm not a good podcaster. So good
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.880]   I'm an honest man
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.160]   I tell you when leo has to go pee and you all know it
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.960]   And you can trust me for that you can trust me more than chat gpt
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.000]   All right stay safe. Uh, that wasn't no pimping
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.600]   Um, besides the thing we saw and here's your here's your three-course dinner
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   Next to a bunch of listings which I actually find more useful because then I have more choice
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.120]   Um, it's choosing for me. I don't need to choose for me in this case
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.800]   I think it's kind of a dumb example
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.280]   They also showed and there's a clip up on the rundown that when you're reading
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.880]   A an example they gave was you're reading somebody's financial results in its a 20 page annual report
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.440]   And you've got a little chat gpt button on the on the browser and they cite browser
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.280]   And you say summarize there just document
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.440]   And so it does something to your browsing as you go
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.120]   So what I what i'm curious for since leo actually
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.960]   Read more about you or you have read more about it or and has read more about that I have is what besides the
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.880]   fancy
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   New wikipedia box
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.960]   Does chat gpt actually give microsoft because I think that a lot of this hype that we're seeing in the media coverages
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.760]   Oh my god, google's doomed. Well what i've seen so far are neat gimmicks
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.680]   Yeah, but I don't think it's a fundamental things it google does think it's a problem
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:47.280]   I mean they're worried about this way i'm gonna get to that night read yeah, but but it's all about my media problem
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   You want no microsoft gets out of it just try to sign up for this
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:58.960]   And it will tell you okay. Well, you got to make edge your browser your default browser on all the platforms hello
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.120]   Justice department. Yeah, I mean it's the worst. It's like a to play
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:08.640]   First of all edges a terrible browser because that is a bunch of additional stuff like coupons
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.040]   Then it's just uh
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.560]   Larded with ways for microsoft to make money and spy on you
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.360]   So you know you're leo I found what I went laundering down the microsoft page because I never used being
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.440]   I went wandering down the page where they have all the headlines
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.560]   That's interesting
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.480]   They clearly use third-party data because they had things that I bought for my kia
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.440]   And I never used to make a stop point. I have no way for them to know it
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:35.360]   Yeah, google would know it that search for it. Microsoft wouldn't and then second is you click on a news story
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:42.640]   It goes to a microsoft url. Yeah, it doesn't go. No, apple does the same thing and in apple news you can't share an article
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:48.240]   I hate apple news. Yeah, you have to share it. I'm just like apple news if google did this stuff
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.680]   They would get they would get prawn in but quarter. Yeah admittedly
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.320]   But all three companies are trying to disintermediate the original sources the information
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.280]   And this is the same complaint people have about stable diffusion
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:05.840]   Stealing from artists because all of the stable diffusion stuff is is rehashed existing art that it's scraped
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.360]   They have the same place about chat gpt. It's scraping from every possible tech source
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.520]   I mean, I think if you're putting stuff on the internet, you're kind of saying okay
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.400]   It's out there, but you're not saying it's public domain and they're treating it like it's public domain
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:26.160]   That's the whole different different world that copyright was made for a very different era
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.880]   Yeah, and we all know that yeah one of the reasons there's a limit on copyright term
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:37.600]   Is because all creation stands on the shoulders of the people who went before Walt Disney didn't invent snow white
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.880]   Uh, the brothers grim did of course he tried to pull the ladder up after him as soon as he did it
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:49.280]   He said well, I had copyrighted this but uh, the whole premise is eventually goes in the public domain
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:56.000]   This is what larry legs less it was really pushing with creative commons and becomes part of the next generation
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.120]   Of generative creation nobody creates in a vacuum
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:05.440]   Uh, maybe we're gonna loosen copyright and say well, you know in order to promote this idea of artificial intelligence
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.720]   Um, we're gonna allow people to do it is transformative
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:17.680]   Well, let's let's not forget you cannot copyright information. You can only copyright the treatment of that information and so it basically so when
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.880]   Uh business insider rewrites the wall street journal
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.840]   They can get away with that they could do that because they are rewriting it. They are taking the base information
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.720]   Can I give you my theory about about google versus microsoft on this having watched the thing?
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.120]   Well, let's first let's talk. Yes, but wait, let's talk about why i'm asking
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.960]   But we haven't done the hypocrisy we got to do the second part of the story
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.000]   Which is what google announced and then we could say what yes serious about it
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.400]   Well, is there anything else from microsoft that you found?
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.080]   um
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.560]   Game-changing interesting fascinating not yet, but it's not out yet understand
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.040]   My only experiences with niva. I think it is game-changing
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:00.800]   I do agree. It's bad for all the people who created the original information because you're not going to click links
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.360]   This is worse than snippets. This is the answer to you
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:12.080]   It is what if there's a potential rev share there? Well, maybe there's a way around it. That's maybe what's what
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.640]   Hold on we can't trust everything that this gives us and I think that's
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.440]   We need to talk about that because like a financial statement if you're gonna pull and call from that. Okay
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:31.120]   Um, and it's also old it's 2021 so that's when we look at that's all old. I what you just said
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:37.680]   That's the way the chat gdpt that came out as the tests worked. That is not how it's going to work for being
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:43.280]   Okay, so chat tell me as designed was never designed to be factual
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:49.120]   Okay, he said that up front said look it's gonna be wrong. We're not really it's not designed to be factual
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:56.560]   That's what Stephen wolfram said when he wrote his article is we should work with these guys because wolfram alpha is mathematically factual
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:02.400]   That's our primary purpose, but it's not with chat gpt. Maybe if we work together they would be better
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.520]   But that's just that's a that's a setting
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:11.280]   Similarly the fact they froze it at whatever was a spring 2021. That's a sad
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.600]   It's mostly about cost. They could do what google does they could be continuously spidering information and adding it to the database
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.280]   It's just a matter of cost
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.280]   I don't know and they haven't said what
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.240]   The chat gpt used for bing or google's with their bard is going to do
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.440]   But my guess is that will it has to be if it's a search result it's got to be up to the minute got to be current
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.800]   You can't search for something and say well, this is only good through April 2021. That's useless
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.440]   Yeah, so I don't think we should judge it by what chat gpt
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:44.080]   But but Stacy's still right Stacy's still right about the primary point here, which is again
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.520]   Everybody forgets the primary job is to predict the next word
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.240]   Not to understand not to know what a fact is not to deliver facts
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.840]   It almost needs a separate process to fact check itself
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:01.600]   Because all it's doing is predicting words. That's how well again. That's how it was set up
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.880]   That's what open ais demo was set up
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:11.280]   That's not what this by the way is going to use chat gpt 4 right the next one right right or is it three?
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.080]   I can't anyway. I've lost track four four four is the next four
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:21.040]   There's nothing to say that chat gpt 4 cannot be biased towards fact trualism now. Yes, we should point out
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.480]   That google in its demonstration saying yeah, we got that whoops made a mistake
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.600]   Like the first yes, so google announced
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.680]   Bard we should tell people yeah, so we had talked about apprentice bard last week is the thing google was
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.920]   We you know every company including facebook has said oh no, we got that
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.960]   It's really interesting what happened, which is I think essentially chat gpt
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:50.080]   Everybody else was doing this in secret including by the way. I might add china
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.240]   uh
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.280]   But chat gpt and open ai decided let's let's just just release the public see what happens
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.880]   And I think they had a good point which was we can't go to the next stage unless we get a lot more input from people
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.040]   That's part of it same reason elan musk puts full self driving out
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.160]   To the public even though it's not really ready. We kill a few people. Well, yeah, but we learn things
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.320]   That's how I mean at some point you got to do that
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.080]   So you don't have to kill people to be clear
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.080]   No, but I just thank you elan
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.600]   I agree with the premise that you do have to fail
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:31.840]   You do yes, you do have to fail and at least cars unlike chat gpt if you fail you kill somebody or you may
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.080]   Yeah, I mean
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   Our argument in phoenix
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.680]   We're saying that you shouldn't do that that we should actually avoid loss of life as our failure mode. I agree
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:49.120]   What if you couldn't we can have failure mode, but loss of life. It's not your innovation is not worth loss of life
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.120]   What if you wish I agree what if you couldn't
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.160]   Then you have to say self-driving cars is not worth killing people and I think that's a fair
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:01.440]   I mean we can make is killing people worse far fewer people stacey. I'm not agreeing with you
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.720]   But just double advocate. What is well? No, and that's what people say
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.120]   but not as many
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.520]   If you kill 10 people to save millions, I'm not a what is it?
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.800]   Frawly until the terrain is so frawly. Yeah, I'm not I'm not going for that now
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.520]   By the way, that's your people to
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.560]   That's your personal opinion
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.960]   But not everybody agrees with you on that
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.520]   Well, I know let her finish with the opinion
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.480]   Um in part of that's because with self-driving cars
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.000]   the
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.320]   Life-saving stuff isn't proven yet and it's kind of a little farther out
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:45.440]   I think the closer you are to immediate savings of lives the more you can like so if you were going to kill people to develop a
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.680]   cancer vaccine
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.880]   That's a little different depending on how many people you kill, right?
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.320]   Um
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:58.000]   Because that's a little bit more direct than saying. Oh if we have smarter self-driving cars blah blah blah
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.360]   So, I mean, I I agree these are super nuanced conversations, but
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:07.200]   Yeah, I mean you kind of got off. Sorry. You can you can well, but it's all the same. It's like
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:12.960]   I mean, it's not killing people, but it's not all the same. That's like tech essentialism right there. It's not all the same
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.360]   You kill a few people, but you save millions is a good thing
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.520]   And what it does for the stock price, Stacy come on
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.560]   I hate to yeah, I hate to point out, but this is how human civilization works
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.240]   A war
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:34.800]   Happens because it killed it. It's going to kill people, but it's for a greater good, right? This is isn't though. Well
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:39.200]   You know, I don't yes, I'm a pacifist. I agree
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:46.160]   I think it depends on your war. I think if we hadn't fought the revolution king georgia to give it up eventually anyway
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.200]   So we could have saved some life Canada's nice. I'd like to be more Canadian. Nothing wrong with Canada's nice
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:59.040]   I mean that that but this is this is the story of human civilization. You can't you can't deny that is we've always you know
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.760]   Medical trials people die clinical trials people died. I know
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.400]   but that again is
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.960]   That is a different gradation
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:15.600]   That is closer to like immediately saving people having a medical trial that actually does something
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.880]   Although I would argue you would have to have certain efficacy rates
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.520]   to like test that out
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.640]   but
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   just to say I mean because
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.200]   Self-driving vehicles are we talking about self-driving vehicles? Are we talking about like?
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.760]   well
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:38.000]   In general just but if you had a search term that like I don't think risking someone's life first
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.800]   Like let's say you were like here's a great cake recipe
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.640]   Let's make it with bleach and that was what was coming in your search chair would be bad
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:50.800]   But the good news is that is not worth the loss of life. So I think for having a mouth. I will never do that again
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.640]   Okay, we know already that we never should do
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   That's a good point. I mean, but
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.120]   You could you can you stipulate that there are some things that you have to put this out in the public
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.120]   To find out what you can if you can
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.640]   You're also assuming we can put it out into the public without any sort of guardrails like without
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.280]   Thinking for a hot second like oh wait
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:22.560]   How could this be used to like really injure or harm people and then try to predict what those are in guard against them?
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:29.440]   Well, I do I don't need a responsible thing to open AI did you because you can't go into a chat GPT and say build me a molyta of cocktail
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.600]   On the other hand, they didn't think people were as wily as they were
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.960]   And they learned from doing that that there are ways to trick chat GPT and telling you how to build them all
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.240]   Yes
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   And they'll figure that out that is fine
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.840]   I mean, that is what people do we are I mean, that's that's like hacking right hacking
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.640]   It's hard to predict how awful humans can be
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.760]   People can also check it for good
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:51:01.280]   There's a long history of connect both microsoft and meta putting out AI bots
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.320]   That immediately went bad
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.080]   Yeah, yeah, and I mean this is it. This is not new
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.800]   but it seems to
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.760]   Open AI's contention is what we have to at some point
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.480]   And they would think they're probably right you can't develop this stuff in secret forever at some point
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.960]   Well, I mean, what's the point if you never put it out?
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.400]   Right, but they did it right they thought about
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:31.760]   malicious use cases and tried to predict and put those guardrails in so that's what things gonna do and that's what things
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.840]   And monitor for it and that's all or rollers
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.240]   Well, yeah
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.280]   So the there's two questions first of all is it worth it to do this that was answer question
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.960]   And are you satisfied that there are some value in doing it this doing this?
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:52.160]   I got not of it yet. Okay. It still just seems like um a pretty shiny layer
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:58.480]   Yep on on text or or information that we need I agree with still going to end up just
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.640]   Probably clicking through to a story or a link hopefully
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.160]   Versus just going off of that. I don't think you will and
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.320]   I mean for certain things like your research is a best new
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:18.240]   Yeah, but like I think more and more often like which president was assassinated in his bathtub. Yeah, I actually don't know
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:22.960]   None of them have been any none. I don't think
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.920]   Which president was a sauna? I think there will be you know
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:35.200]   Some use for it, but the way this isn't this has been sensationalized. I think it's just a little over height in my opinion
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.400]   Here's an example. I asked is it better to turn off my computer at night? Is it quite sure we get a lot?
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:46.480]   And there are links to a bunch of there's a guy named leo should I ask leo
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.760]   Not me not related, but anyway, there are a lot of answers to that but look at the
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:58.240]   So so aunt you say well, I would end up clicking on none of these but look at the answer that the ai from niva
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.800]   Gave me. Yeah, that's that's that's legit and it kind of is the answer right? You don't need to go any farther than that
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   It gives you three different sources
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.840]   Yeah, that's legit
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.120]   So I think at this point you've got this is what you want it all along. Okay. Yeah, that's legit
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:20.160]   That that answers my question. Okay. So so that's question one is is there a reason?
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.160]   Is there a benefit to doing this? I think I can agree there's so there's potentially some benefits
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:30.560]   Potential. Yeah, the next overplayed media right now, but keep going. Yeah, then the next question is
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.600]   Should we do it given that?
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.920]   Sometimes it'll be wrong or there'll be problems with it. Is it worth doing it?
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.120]   Should we be doing it now? Stacy should we be doing it now or should we wait?
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.720]   We should be I mean, yes, we should be doing this now. I think when you're doing it though
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.960]   You need to say hey, this result was generated by ai or something like that
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:56.000]   However you want to um, but yeah, and and this is a good use case for it
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.640]   and hopefully there is the other thing I would say you should have in something like this is
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.040]   a
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:11.840]   Feedback form that's really accessible for like uh, you just told me to make a cake with bleach kind of situations or right?
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.720]   This is like because I think one of the things we miss a lot with deploying AI
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:23.120]   Is having the ability to easily give feedback that's listened to and acted upon pretty quickly
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:28.720]   Uh to fix things that are biased or just absolutely wrong, right?
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:35.280]   Do you should have to be a famous person on twitter to get attention to a problem? Yeah, do all of these security cameras
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:43.760]   That have ai that says all right, this is a person approaching. This is an animal approaching and you send us do they actually take into
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.360]   Feedback within the apps that people submit say no you got this wrong or
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:53.600]   Or is that just some of them do some of them let you tell them some of them don't it appears?
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.160]   Here's what uh, neva does
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.280]   I sorry I keep using neva except that they beat everybody to the punch nobody, you know, they're not a big name
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.320]   But they beat everybody the punch they have ready you're giving them all the credit
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.440]   Right at the top it says is this useful?
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.640]   So you have a meet a place you can immediately give them feedback
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   Right, they have a share button too, which is kind of interesting. I asked how do I tie a slipknot?
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:24.640]   To tie a slipknot take a bite of rope and wrap the tag end around the bite once or twice hold the loop pull the end to tighten
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.320]   It's a bite. What's what's a bite? I don't know. That's the next question
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:35.040]   Uh pulled that from a bunch of five different websites including wikipedia 101 knots wiki how net knots animated knots
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   Um, and then it gives you the what you would expect which is the videos and all that stuff
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:44.640]   I I do like the idea that it says you know what this these are a bunch of different sources because I hate
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:48.400]   That a lot of people depend on one source for all the information
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.160]   And that's all they trust and this way you don't have to click through three links
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   Yeah, and then by the way, so here's the is this useful and then you have a thumbs up. Yes, it's great. No, I'd like to report a problem
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.480]   Let's report a problem
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.680]   Now we fight
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.440]   Yes, stale outdated information and correct answer mixes up people not
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.040]   Not comprehensive nonsensical or other. I like this. Yeah. Yeah, nice
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:16.560]   Well, how do we tell them in don't want to bite is so I think it should also have a
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.800]   Do they have a this is harmful or this is offensive or this is uh
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.000]   They don't they have other
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.320]   Which you could then say offensive
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.160]   Um, like I feel like you need it. You need a like a super
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:35.120]   Like alert category, right? Like yeah, that's true. Like so we don't know what a bite is
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:41.680]   That's not a problem. Whoop. They also have removed one of the cited sources, which is interesting like that source wasn't a good source
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.680]   You shouldn't let's go
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.680]   Like it. This is how you develop this
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.640]   Um, and and you know, there's a lot of problems with it. Niva sometimes says I can't
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:55.920]   Or my servers are over, you know burdened and so forth. It's just a little company
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.760]   Oh, I should scooter ex tolls it tell is telling us what a bite is
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.000]   It's a fold in the rope. Are you safe?
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:06.720]   You shaped section of rope being used in making it up. There you go
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:13.760]   Are we going to get to google google's ai chatbot they announced bard which we had mentioned was
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.040]   Last week the google said to everybody
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:23.840]   Uh, all hands on deck use bard. We got a apprentice bard. We got to see we're gonna get this up to speed
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.000]   So they tested it internally
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.560]   Um, and now as of
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   Five 30 this morning, uh, google says we're going to put bard
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:38.000]   And did they say when they're going to put it in their um, uh, no they said that they are well
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.920]   It was it was fascinating because I watched the whole thing
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.560]   They said, uh, um
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.560]   What's what's his name? Uh, promicar?
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.440]   Uh came out and by the way, baby made a mistake himself
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.400]   He said that the today was the 25th anniversary of google search. No, this year is not related to the area
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:56.240]   Correct myself. It was the issues facts are hard. Let's put it
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.360]   Well, then they got ready for the the the live demo with the phone and the phone was missing
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:07.680]   God was gone is gone. It's gone. Somebody they had to use a search engine to find it. Yeah, something's gone france
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.360]   You know, I don't know if they found it. They find my phone and they found it
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.440]   I know they did it was gone. It's gone. So, uh, wow
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.960]   So
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:22.320]   And they made this take this tells you that this was rushed that they were for waking out and they said
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.200]   With microsoft and now it's 10. Yes, we got it. Well because of the I think it's mainly a press
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.320]   I'm my my point later will be my marketing, but let's get to the details of what they said
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:35.280]   So they said that uh, the interesting thing was they kept pressing again and again and again. It was interesting
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.680]   How we're doing this safely
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:43.520]   Chatty p t could go rushing out there because it's chat to p t facebook and google have been doing both tons of ai work
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:48.400]   But they're scared to death because every little mistake that as we see today
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.960]   Uh is going to get blown up. And so they kept on talking about how we're doing this safely
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.400]   We have trusted people judging this we're going to put it out in the right way
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.960]   We're going to put out there a time no promise of time
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.600]   But we're going to have this really neat things going to all kinds of stuff
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.960]   And then they went on it was almost like an IO thing
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:11.040]   Where they went on with other things that they're doing that are neat some of this is in the change log and elsewhere
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:15.040]   Um enhancements to translation enhancements to maps
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.680]   um multi modal search
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.520]   uh
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.520]   more things with lands
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.680]   Uh, so they tried to do a comprehensive
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.400]   And they said a probacar said, you know
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:33.040]   Search is still our number one moon shots search will always change but the moon the moon moves he said
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.840]   And and it'll always change and so they had a a large IO like list of
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:41.520]   All of these were doing well, I'll make my point now real quickly, which is
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.320]   Google I think is far way ahead
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.320]   Of microsoft and AI microsoft had to go use chat gpt
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:54.480]   Google does have all kinds of neat things, but it's a marketing problem to great extent because I don't think to use lens
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.960]   I know i'm not going to think to use multi modal search. I'm not going to recognize that
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.920]   Translation is 10 percent better. They have all this work and all this wonderful stuff
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.720]   It's a much more nuanced story, but they don't know how to tell the story at all
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:13.120]   Microsoft comes out and says look at this shiny toy. We just added to our old Buick
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.520]   Cool. Everybody said yeah nice paint job about old Buick. Can I take a spin?
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.320]   Yeah, great. And that's kind of where it is now
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:26.960]   Google has you know this monster thing a huge thing and Microsoft has a Buick with a new um
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.560]   Paint job. Here's the reason that this is an issue
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.600]   Because for all of the great stuff google does with translate that's AI
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:41.840]   Uh, you know with lens that's AI. The one thing that makes google money
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:49.280]   Is ads on search search search and if a Buick comes along and steals the money maker
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.720]   Doesn't matter what you got in translate in lens right?
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:58.880]   And so they're threatened you can have a self-driving car or cab and and and
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.560]   Yeah, it's an existential threat to google
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.840]   Well, this is where i'm going to i'm going to disagree a little bit
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.480]   Because I think that the media
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.240]   Hype has been ridiculous today because they're dying they're dying to say google's doomed
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:20.080]   and um, you know what little I can play with the chat gpt stuff that demos and that kind of stuff
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.640]   Okay, but uh, and you know I I tweeted today
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:30.080]   I'm old enough to remember when dolly was changing all of our lives and I haven't heard dolly talked about what a while
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.840]   And and I think that there's this rush. It's part of what i'm saying
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:41.360]   There's this kind of rush to the shiny thing in media and the desire for google to be vulnerable because it's a good story if it is true
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.520]   Um, this is how we give people to read our stuff. I know
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:51.120]   This is wrong with media and everybody blames the internet for that and we invented it
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.880]   Okay, that's not true. So oh like yeah, we did this before the internet. Yeah
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.960]   Yeah, we invented sensationalism and the attention that's that's because that's what people
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.200]   Read that's what they're that's what we fed them. It's what we trained them to read
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.520]   Well, but see if you have like john blow who's sitting there who cares about his life and like
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.800]   The super bowl or whatever he cares about if you want to make him care about something else
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.280]   You have to make it exciting right?
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.200]   So basically we're just trying to push something that people don't really care about and make it exciting
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.800]   That's gonna say no you're insulting me and that's why I don't like you news people right in
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.400]   No, I'm not trying to install. I'm just saying like aunt probably like okay
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.960]   I know you like aunt cares about photography and google and anything he's doing for his job
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.920]   So he'll click on this but like if you don't care about that you've got to really make an effort
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.960]   So maybe aunt doesn't care so much about fashion, but if someone you know does something
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.280]   I'm the weird one in this group because even with some some of the photography related news is out there
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.720]   There are some things I will refuse to click on because they will
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.760]   initialize the headline and
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.560]   Say something
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.560]   I'm like that's you just
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.840]   You haven't earned my click on that. Yeah, is the
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.920]   Demographics and is the demographic that drives advertisers and creators crazy
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.920]   Because I don't want to look on youtube with the thumbnails you making the weird faces and
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:29.360]   I refuse that we can't read you. We can't read you. It's driving us crazy
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   I
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.080]   Think to say Stacy it's it's to get people to
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.040]   Read something they're not interested in but also to some degree
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.600]   It's trying to write stuff for the things people are interested in right if you found out everybody wants to know more about peds dispensers
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.560]   You do more articles about peds dispensers. Well, yes. Yes, that is a hundred percent true
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.840]   But I think originally it's really just a desire to
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:01.440]   To find the narrative that gets people to read the story especially because if even originally at your most noble self, right
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.240]   You're trying to get people to care about something you care about and how are you gonna get them?
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.080]   That might be where you went wrong and what you should really just do is write about the things people care about you as dumb as they might be
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.200]   And stop trying to but your attention is stuff they should that you want them to care about
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:23.920]   Stacy, I'm in the autumn of my nobody cares about city council meetings. Just give up
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.880]   But they should care about it because it matters to their lives
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.720]   But it is a baby fall out of a three-story window now tell me about that
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:39.920]   So that that comes from the telegraph that comes from mass media. That's an invention. No, that's human life. No, no, no, no
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:45.680]   Well, well, yeah, there's witchcraft and all that before but humans care about I thought we had some standards
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.680]   I I'm at the I'm at the autumn of my career folks and I'm ashamed of my business. I'm ashamed of my
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.680]   Yeah, because all I am
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:00.960]   All this comes from the original from gossip originally from what people talked about over the backyard fence
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:08.080]   And that's the things people care about and it's embarrassing because we don't really care about the city council meeting or what
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.240]   Joe Biden said at the state of the union yesterday. We care about
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.200]   Oh, do you hear that the tasty freeze did they're down at the corner went out of business?
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:26.400]   That but we but the media we care about there with me everything the internet is accused of media invented the attention economy sensationalism
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:33.440]   Trying to manipulate people's emotions trying to addict them all of that just starts with media
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.000]   That's a internet is is it a temporary phase of trying to copy that I'm gonna defend media
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.800]   I think they're just trying to meet people where they're at
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.640]   Yeah, and we care about celebrities. That's how we are
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.600]   That's how we are trying to make money
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.760]   Everything you accused at algorithms of doing is what media people do and they're the algorithms are just trying to copy
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.640]   What media people have taught them to do all these years, which wasn't always the case
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:06.160]   Yes, there was witchcraft in early printing. Yes, early printing caused all of that. It's in my book coming out in June
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.240]   Um, we're still looking at me. I'm trying to tell you isn't it possible to interpret it
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.120]   Your way that it's malicious and my way that they're just trying to meet people where they're at
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.080]   There's a middle way which is to say what's the what's the motive that's involved
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.840]   And if it's informing people if it's entertaining people entertainment is a fine thing
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.360]   Well, you'd be dumbed but but if paper that nobody wanted to read
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.640]   If it's to do what you just said a minute ago about google and ads and all that that's exactly
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:39.200]   The problem is we're in an early phase here of the internet where it has adopted the business models that we're known in media
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.360]   That's why people think it's media
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.400]   And I think we've got a break free of that but if I and so
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   So there's worst media is now on the internet
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.800]   There's two reasons I might choose what I wanted to do a podcast about
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:57.200]   One because I care a lot about it and and I'm just gonna do it because that's what I like to talk about
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.680]   Which is my way how I do it
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:05.520]   Or the other is to is to do something that serves your audience that your audience is interested in
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.160]   Um, can there not be a
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.280]   Without a
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.320]   Lucky if you think you care a lot about it turns out the thing I cared a lot about some people not a lot
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:22.720]   Not the vast majority. We're not producing content that you know competes with tmz by any means, right?
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.120]   This is not good morning america. This is not
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.520]   And it never will be and and I don't even feel good night america
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.000]   But I don't feel any pressure to make it more like tmz
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.560]   Yo, what did bill get who did bill gait sleep with last night?
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.560]   I don't think we need to do that
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.400]   But I happen to be interested in technology and there's a certain amount
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.920]   There's enough people we're interested in that that our content is of interest to them and we can make a living
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.120]   I don't think that's been god. I'm serious all corrupt
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.440]   But I'm saying that the corrupt I'm saying that the corruption that the internet is accused of are
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.800]   Corruptions that came from media. I am the internet. No, I am the internet
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.760]   I think the vast majority of the internet is people like it's like us
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.760]   People write a blog about something there just it's it's glen fleshman doing a book about keyboards
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.880]   Yeah, yeah, I think this is our escape hatch. I agree. I agree
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.600]   The internet is our escape hatch from those corrupted media models, but I
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:20.960]   You know, I sat in here and his arena joke because it isn't gonna look at that
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.720]   Screw you all
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:28.480]   Ants gonna read the article. It's about a camera that doesn't have sensationalism in it doesn't have some guy going whoa
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:36.160]   It's gonna be about the camera if the headline says new camera announced from manufacturer so-and-so
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.880]   I'll click. Okay. What did I know? You're the antidote
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:48.080]   You're how it should be and would you rather go to the Nike site or the story about Nike?
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.560]   And rather go to the Nike site because Nike is the source. That's the source. Ah, yep, but what if
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:02.160]   Search engine gave you the information you were looking for there were full circle. There we are. Mm-hmm
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.520]   I started at the beginning of this
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:12.560]   If i'm searching for something more than likely i'm looking for the link to whom i'm talking about if i'm searching for Nike
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.160]   I'm looking for that first URL to say Nike dot com slash topic. Have you you know
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.760]   Is aunt short, but that's but that's me though
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.400]   Well, but i'm saying you're the right you're you got it the right you got it right
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.480]   And I bet you a lot of people are like you. I know i'm like you I
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.720]   As soon as I see a youtube thumbnail somebody going
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.480]   You won't believe what happened next if I see an article that says you won't read it. I won't yes go right past
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.960]   And I think that partly that's because you and I have been burned so many times. We're now rebelling
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:50.560]   Right we also know how the sausage is made. Yeah, because we're in the sausage factory. No, we aren't I am the internet
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.280]   You know, I looked at
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.120]   There was a video from I now put it in discord in the
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:04.320]   Channel there uh jared polan who I love uh great photographer in philadelphia area big youtuber
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:12.080]   I've always watched him because he he pretty much tell it like it is and you know don't really hold back and he has good information
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.840]   And there was a recent video that talked about shame on adobe yada yada yada
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.280]   Because at the time there was a news story about adobe
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:29.680]   Allegedly just still in your images and your information to feed into its ai right and when that happened
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.840]   I was like this is bulk
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.320]   Because I remember personally I remember
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:42.640]   When my adobe created cloud creative cloud went through his update they give you a screen of what's what's being affected
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.120]   When you do this update, this is what's going to happen
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:52.480]   And in that screen it mentioned feed in the ai and how you can just opt out. Oh, I said they said i did
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.960]   Yeah, I did this story came out and i'm like what so I went and looked at mine
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   And I had already opted out why because this was months ago, right?
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.080]   When they were released
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.080]   I think in that case it might be a little cynical on that youtubers part because he kind of knew that well
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.440]   No, I think
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.200]   Everybody talking about it. He wasn't the only one it was a hot story at the time
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.400]   And I didn't yeah, I think sometimes people notice like I mean we see this all the time in the smart home
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.080]   Where like i'm like holy cow look you can do this and then
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.120]   You know, I'll write about it because I found it helpful or useful. I'm not trying to tell people this brand new
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.920]   I'm just like hey this just happened like kevin just did his
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:37.920]   hearing aids with his ipod second generation pro whatever they are
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.480]   And people loved that it's been out for months many people knew about it
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.600]   We weren't saying it's new but people learn something so I don't always think
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:55.200]   That's not what happened with this story miss Stacy. What happened with this story is people were saying shame on you with delvi
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.560]   They're stirring up on that. Dovey was straight up saying look. This is what the update is going to do
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.040]   You can opt out right here
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.000]   And
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.240]   Of course I did and I don't know if everybody else did but I did so I didn't think anything about it
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.080]   Hey
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:14.000]   I think jeff is finally coming around to what i've been saying all along about google
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.400]   Which was that if google
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.760]   If google had just stuck to their knitting and given us search results
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.360]   Instead of buying all these companies and doing all these recommendations
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.000]   They would be in a in a cleaner position, but really what it is now. It's all about
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.120]   Linkbait marketing and well, i'm gonna agree in a way
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.920]   One of the people on master dog where the discussion is much better than twitter and and we're good today
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.720]   You couldn't even tweet did you see that? I could well I can again
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.920]   So but but mass was gonna limit it, but we'll get to that later after the next commercial
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.480]   so uh somebody said to me a mask done today well the problem is that that
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.080]   Part of my point was that
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.800]   Microsoft can show me it's shiny chrome
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.400]   Google I have to ask for it. I have to say oh there's this thing called lens. I have to know who to use it and so on
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   So forth but then somebody came in and said
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.640]   Um, well, you know the problem is that google saying we have all this technology
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.920]   And how can we make you use it which is the same problem with media right?
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.880]   I have this newspaper
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:17.680]   How can I make you buy it rather than going back and saying what do people need and I remember way back in the day marissa mire
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.880]   at
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.080]   Davos
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.240]   Uh, when I talked about hyper local and she said no no it's gonna be hyper personal
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.080]   And she was right she was you know the idea was google knows you well enough. Now of course now that's scary
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.480]   That's creepy. That's data. That's awful because google blew it and the whole industry blew it
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.360]   Is in scary people often letting media scare people
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.280]   But that's where it should have been going is that google is truly your assistant
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.840]   That's why they use that word and they didn't really fulfill on that promise
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:51.520]   So you and I are also agreeing that that the the way i'm sad about 120 closing
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.120]   But I think your point is right that that was stuff that was off focus
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.520]   So what should their focus be in terms of service?
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:04.480]   With larry page said it when he started when he started google he said it and we can never take advertising because that will pollute our
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:11.280]   Results they knew it but they said we have there's no other way to support there's no other way to do it or for whatever reason
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.560]   They well wall street wall street. Yeah. Yeah. You can blame wall street
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.120]   I mean this neva is interesting because they know they have to pay for it. It's not cheap
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.360]   So they say we're going to charge you five bucks a month is it worth it to you not to have ads
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.080]   uh and to have kind of
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.080]   Search results. So I think this is an
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:36.880]   Underreported story, which is the idea that we're in the middle of a transition where we're going to start paying for things
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.000]   That we once associated with being free because we value our data
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.040]   Soon even if you think about chat gpt and things like that possibly accuracy
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.200]   and like
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.720]   And privacy more and more people and privacy and so privilege
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:15:01.920]   Rears its head here. Yeah. Yeah, but in disinformation misinformation will be free stuff. She will be abundant. Look stuff wasn't free
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:08.720]   I mean stuff always a paper. Yeah, whatever the reality is going to be
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.360]   That conspiracy theorists will get everything that they want in life for free
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:20.000]   People who want quality news and information will pay and and we're gonna face the fact of what that does this notion that
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.760]   I don't care about should I think this notion that stuff should be free came from the internet
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.560]   I didn't say should I didn't say should I just said that the reality is people
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.320]   That crap will be free and quality will be expensive and there's going to be an impact on society
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:40.240]   So I don't know about that. So maybe on the internet you're paying for a couple things and getting
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.640]   quality content
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.440]   But there's always going to be aggregator type services that will
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:54.400]   Be free and have an ad model kind of like I got I got a counter example. How about this counter example?
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.200]   TV used to be free
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.680]   It was ad supported free you had three channels you watch it whatever was on
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.240]   Uh people now are will if she demonstrated and we do it
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.720]   We pay more for content than ever before in history hundreds of dollars a year for every one of us
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.440]   very few people expect
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.920]   content to be free
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.320]   We all Netflix we all know we're all paying for something. That's the county
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.480]   People out there there are but they're a minority. Maybe they're the conspiracy theory enough jobs jobs
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.760]   I don't know, but uh, I I think that's a good example
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.880]   What's dacey saying which is we're gonna realize there's value
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.920]   In some of this stuff and we're gonna pay for it because it's better that way and I think that's happened with television. Yeah
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.880]   I think you're right, but all I'm and I'm dying for pay for
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.400]   um algorithms and filters for social. I'm dying for pay for recommendation engines
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.040]   I think we're gonna end up there. I sorry gree Stacy
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.840]   But i'm also saying it's very stacy like i'm me to say let's think about the implications
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:03.360]   Of the reality here and in a world and truth isn't dead and I don't believe all that but for some people
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   There will be an endless supply of crap and conspiracies
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.920]   And we've got a societal problem about how what do we do?
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.520]   And putting the good stuff behind the paywall because we get away from the advertising and its corruptions
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:28.640]   Is gonna have a second order effect. That's all so I will say one of the problems we had with like the the crap and conspiracy theorists
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.120]   Is that we had?
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:37.600]   Officials who were in power endorsed those for their own gain. So it wasn't just a fact that it was happening
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.240]   It was happening and then people who were
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.880]   Legit were like yes
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:50.800]   It is a hundred percent true that there are children at the basement of this pizza parlor that people are taking blood from
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.800]   For a youth or whatever
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:59.840]   So when a senator tells you that and goes on and they let that person on tv to talk about that
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.080]   They've got both the credibility of their profession, but then they've also got the credibility of a
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.960]   News channel that is cynically pandering to people. Yes. Yes. Again media again media. Yeah
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.520]   but
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.400]   The only reason that person is on that media
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:24.560]   Well, but the only reason that person is on tv is because of their profession because they made it out to whatever profession they were so I
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.320]   I mean
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.960]   Social media is a tool, but it's our inherent cynicism and love of power. That's really
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.800]   Causing us the most problems right by real issue here
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.080]   You're right fizzy
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:41.360]   And and and so many of the problems that we attribute to and blame on technology or media
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.320]   Are simply society this is part of what they are saying to our societies problems are human problems
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.360]   And and and we've got to separate them out and realize that because trying to think that the technology is going to solve it
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.680]   When it didn't cause it is going to get us very far
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:19:00.320]   Right and that's where that's where we are like even trying to regulate hard things like privacy or how many people
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.480]   We should kill with self-driving cars. We seem to think that technology can solve this problem
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:09.440]   But it's really up to us to make an ethical in moral stand. Yes, I agree
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.160]   Now I will tell you something
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:16.560]   That maybe you get for free you probably do get for free that you really should be paying for
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.920]   And that's our sponsor fast man
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.920]   I mean honestly, this is true. I've been saying this for a long time. We yeah, you can get free email
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   But you what do you what does it cost you?
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.040]   To get free email cost you your privacy it costs you
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.000]   Content quality cost you service that might be the most important one support
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.520]   You have a problem with free email good luck finding somebody to fix it
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.680]   And if they cancel your account good luck finding somebody to turn it back on
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:48.480]   That's why years ago I shifted to fast mail and I have never
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:54.240]   Been happier fast mail as a little as three bucks a month, but boy, it's good email
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:00.240]   See if the thing is free emails not free you pay for it with your privacy with lack of support for a variety of things
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:05.120]   For over 20 years fast mail has been a leader in email privacy
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:10.720]   At fast mail your data stays yours with better productivity features for as little as three dollars
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:16.560]   A month no ads your personal data is safe. It's gdpr compliant
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:23.200]   Fast mail stores your data in the us and when you need support you're talking to a real email expert in the us
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:28.800]   Who puts you first because you are the customer not the product?
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:34.960]   I am a huge fan of fast mail. Let me just run through some of the many many reasons I use
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.600]   Fast mail first of all it's real email
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:44.800]   Uh, they use an i-map server called syrus, which is open source. They contribute back to that open source project
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.880]   They also have features like sieve, which is an amazing email tool for filtering
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.640]   They have an automation system that lets you automatically write your sieve rules
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:00.080]   But when you're in your fast mail email and you see something you go. Oh, I want to make a rule about that
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.880]   It's as easy as just clicking that email and saying hey, I need a new rule and suddenly your email is organized
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.960]   It's done right. It's the way it should be
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.520]   Fast mail works with any email client because it's true i-map
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:24.240]   Even gmail isn't real i-map. They use some non i-map features like tags fast mail gives you the best of both worlds i-map folders gmail style tags
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.800]   and it works with thunderbird and and firefox and and
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   Google mail and email whatever program you're using on android or ios or
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:40.160]   Or a mac or windows or linux it works it works with all of them because it's i-map it's standard email
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.120]   They even have a fabulous web interface better than anybody's web interface
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.920]   plus apps on ios and android that let you customize your workflow with colors and custom swipes they've got
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.640]   Sorry jeff night mode
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.720]   Or day mode if you like that
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.760]   You can send you can snooze you can use folders or labels you can search bar
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:05.200]   Keep track of all the important details in your life. I like fast mail so much
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:12.080]   I recently moved my calendars from google and my address book from google to fast mail because it supports true cal dev and web dev
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.160]   And uh card dev so it's it's it's absolutely standard
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.440]   And now i sync up all my calendars with fast mail my notes too
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:27.840]   It works with password managers like our sponsor bit warden and one password to make it easy for you to create unique passwords for every account
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:33.120]   But also unique email addresses for every account which makes it doubly safe
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.320]   I love that plus there's the added benefit of if if a company you subscribe to
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.120]   Sales or email address you know exactly who did it because they're the only ones with that address
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:49.520]   I use I use the domain manager to keep all my domains at fast mail.com
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:58.160]   Whether it's for websites or servers my minecraft server because then all my emails handle properly using all the modern authentication techniques like dmark
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.640]   and d kim
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.160]   spf
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.360]   Fastmail does it right they practically invented this stuff
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:11.200]   And advertisers, sorry, but there's no room for you your privacy is at the center
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:16.720]   People use fast mail because look at just the reviews of people and i'll put my name in there too because
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:20.320]   I've been using fast mail for 10 years and I could not be happier
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:25.840]   I just signed up for another three years. I do it three years at a time. Those annual prices save you some money
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.440]   Uh, i've tried them all folks. This is the one
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.120]   And don't worry about losing information. You can take your old email move it over to fast mail
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.120]   You can even and I have this have your gmail accounts active and just have it automatically forward to fast mail
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.600]   So you use all of the benefits of fast mail
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.720]   But you don't have to give up your old email address. You can create custom addresses as many as you want
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.520]   So I have you know, I have a domain
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:56.640]   Leoville.com but anything sent to at leoville.com goes into my inbox
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.000]   So I have as many email addresses as I was I want an infinite number
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.440]   Fast mail is moving email forward with new internet standards and open source innovations
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.160]   The power other email services
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:13.120]   They're the leaders. They're the best new year new you new email look
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:18.080]   I don't know how to convince you but at least you can try it free for 30 days convince yourself
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:25.920]   Reclaim your privacy boost productivity make email yours with the best email service in the world and I am not alone
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.920]   Geeks agree fast mail is the one fast mail.com/twit

[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.320]   He's Brett was like he's one of the classiest guys in the business and friend feed was amazing
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.280]   That's how he got to google. I did was a google that bought friend. Yeah. Yeah
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.840]   Friend feed was the best social network bar none if that were still around
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:42.960]   Anyway
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:49.920]   So Brett who he found he was at google first and then he found it friend feed and that's how he got to facebook
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.320]   Right
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.360]   Fright where terra
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.960]   Killed friend feed
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.920]   Well, no, you know what we just been around a long time and this is 15 years a tech history, right? This is
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.840]   Yep. Yeah, so he and clay have gotten together to launch
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.200]   An artificial intelligence startup
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   Sorry, it's all the children got a
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.360]   Lot change bot change bot change
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:21.840]   It's clearly say it's basically what's happening with AI is like it's going to underpin things like
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:27.680]   It's going to become an infrastructure type of technology. Yeah in being able to
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:36.080]   Throw computing powder power at designing these algorithms and then scaling them out over different problem classes is going to be like
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.360]   Private or a mobile service. Yeah, it could be he's just going to tell farmers when to plant crack crops
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:44.480]   And we don't know what he's going to do with it. Yeah, yeah, something something related to businesses
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.120]   What he's saying that's all I say he's not saying we're just getting started
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.960]   Um
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.720]   But it's going to be an AI. I think it's smart. I mean if I were going to a young man
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:28:00.080]   Starting out in this world. I might look into AI as well. He's somebody on a war 43. That's young to me
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.600]   Nope, that's that's over
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   That's old ish
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:13.600]   See these things about oh, i'm 40 now and I go god. That's like a kid. That's like right?
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.320]   That's oh god. Yeah
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320]   Oh, yeah, oh yeah
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.120]   Oh
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.760]   Right here in the 40s. Oh whoops this way 40 is the best time
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:32.400]   Then you got the energy you got the verb you can still walk. Yeah, it's still obnoxious. Yep
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.360]   They're obnoxious
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.480]   Yeah, you could go out there and you could start a new AI startup
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.640]   Yep
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.320]   Getting right on it. These it but I have to say anything that clay
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.960]   Uh and brett do is going to be something. I mean these two are really smart
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:54.480]   A lot I have to say though a lot of times these old guys
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:59.040]   Who had great successes in their 20s and 30s
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:03.200]   Don't do so well in their 40s. I'm just saying yeah, but he started enough stuff

[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.080]   Yeah, he certainly got the credentials. I mean, that's a hell of a resume
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.640]   Nothing more to say except that that's what they're doing. We don't know what and we don't know when yeah
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:22.800]   I was like, oh, do you know more? But apparently you do not I read the wall street journal. Just like everybody else
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:28.720]   You know what we don't we need Leo. What do we need? We need audio. We did a clip
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.160]   Soundboard of stacy typing so we have breaking news
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.360]   It's like ants
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.600]   You know that's already
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:45.840]   Everybody be quiet for a bit and stacy's gonna type and we're gonna we're gonna record this and use it
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:56.160]   Ouch
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.360]   Okay
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.640]   zoom in
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.680]   Center
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.160]   Enhance okay now we have it. We will make that our new bumper
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:10.160]   Maybe maybe Anthony Nelson's so good. He's gonna add a little do do do do do do do do do and we're gonna have it

[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.320]   us
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.720]   Actually breaking news
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:23.920]   Before you that was real. Oh, there's real breaking news
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.720]   Play the sound effects
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.200]   We don't have them yet
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:35.280]   Yes, yes type again type again. Oh my gosh. It's so fake now
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:45.200]   Oh hello, jerry b
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:50.080]   I will say so you know what my my typing thing is any child of eighties will appreciate this
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:54.880]   It's it's the beginning lyrics for it's the end of the world as we know it see and
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:01.120]   As we know it so like that's great. It starts with an earthquake type it along
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.280]   That's the rhythm or are you actually typing those words?
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:10.320]   Those are the words. I'm typing all work and no play makes jack it. Oh boy
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:15.040]   Because if you can keep up you're feeling really on it, you know, plus you've got the kind of like
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.520]   burve happening there never by
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:24.000]   And then we're gonna rip it out of the headlines
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.960]   And give it to
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.280]   Jeff Jarvis for this breaking story
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:35.200]   So I don't so we were talking earlier about twitter being down for a while and and all of us were told even though we tweeted
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.040]   Not at all that we tweeted too much
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:44.000]   Hollywood reporter says at the same time that twitter is when to place limits on tweet frequency and followers
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.280]   So this oh I thought they just
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:52.000]   They were launching their blog post it was a spurious announcement that said we tweeted too much
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.440]   And everybody got including me and I haven't tweeted in months
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:00.800]   Yeah, but apparently this was a new thing that will limit users to a maximum related but related
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.640]   Oh, but wait a minute listen to the maximum
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:06.240]   2,400 tweets a day
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:12.080]   Oh, man. I gotta cut down jeez who tweets you actually might a hundred times an hour
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.240]   Butts
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:15.280]   Bots
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:21.040]   It's all about the bots, isn't it? It's all about the bots. We had on our mastodon. I had a banum eventually
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:26.560]   We had a guy who aren't post like 400 tech news random tech news stories all at once
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.480]   And it was like I got chiff
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:32.320]   And I know most people can come block any you know you should know this
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:38.160]   I'm mastodon if you don't like it. You just block that person. You won't see there's stuff anymore or you can cost you money
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:44.000]   All that it's not even that it's just that I can't block anybody because I have to what I have to keep an eye on what's going on
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.760]   So I had to see it. No one else had to but it was enough for me as I finally get out of here
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.760]   Go away kid. You bother me
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:56.320]   Yeah, maybe maybe this is elan's way of monetizing like
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:33:04.000]   Chinese or Russian bot farms. It might be as also said there's a maximum of 500 dms a day a follow limit of 400 today
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.040]   So all of that is good all of that is really good frankly
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:14.160]   Uh, but stuff though. Yeah, he's bought stuff here is some other news just came out 3 43 p.m
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.200]   We have been busy with some updates to the twitter API so you continue to continue
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.800]   To build and innovate with us. We're excited and has an extension
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:30.400]   Of the current free twitter API access wait a minute through february 13th. That's yeah, you got a five days
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:37.280]   Wait a minute. What and then oh, wait a minute. There's a thread. Is that what that means jeff that when they get the little the yes
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.760]   The ball of twine what is what does that mean? What is that now? Do I do it now?
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:49.120]   Do I click the ball of twine? What do I do to get the thread? How do I get the school it how come on?
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.240]   Oh, man
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:59.600]   Just just just scroll down. There you go. What is this thing called twitter paid basic access that offers low level of API usage and access to ads API
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:06.960]   $100. Oh forget about it. Jeez these bots a lot of them are just some some guy doing some fun stuff
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:13.040]   You know script kitties, right? Horse ebooks is it going to pay a hundred bucks to tweet random nonsense
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.880]   And researchers can't afford this a new form of wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh wait a minute. Okay
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:23.600]   A new form of free access will be introduced as this is extremely important or ecosystem
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:31.440]   Limited to tweet creation of up to 1500 tweets a month for a single authenticated user token including log in with twitter
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:39.120]   Oh, that's all right 1500 bucks. That's what is that 50 tweets a day? That's probably not right. That's on february 13th
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:43.280]   We will deprecate if you're live blogging. Oh good point
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.400]   On february 13th will deprecate the premium API, but you're not logged black and vi API. You're actually tweeting right aren't you?
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.080]   Right. Yeah, that's true
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.680]   If you're subscribed to premium you can apply for enterprise to continue using these endpoints
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.600]   This is a new chapter for the twitter API to increase quality reduce spam
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.440]   Which it will right and enable the thriving ecosystem. We appreciate your patience as we implement these changes
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.360]   I think a hundred bucks is a lot but on the other hand the free tier 1500 tweets a month
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.920]   That's it seems like would be more than adequate for the horse ebooks of the world
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.160]   This is what google
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:21.840]   Unfortunately sent out it's an animated gif
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.800]   when they were um
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.560]   Talking about this thing they they said here's an example introducing bard
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:34.000]   Why for instance show this question what new discoveries from the james web telescope?
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.560]   Can we tell my nine-year-old about
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.680]   But wait, but wait one of them is wrong
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.920]   James web telescope did not in fact
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:51.120]   Discover any exoplanets that was done 15 years earlier by a professor who was a little annoyed
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:58.960]   I would like to be able to type I mean I already typed these into google like I often type in like like i've got
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:04.240]   Some coconut milk and some tomato paste. I'm like coconut milk and tomato paste. What can I make?
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:11.120]   And it will give me delightful recipes. Well, let me try it. Sure. Like so google will do that or chat gbt
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.560]   Well, this is just straight up normal google
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.440]   But I'm wondering if it would be better with like an AI
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:26.000]   Tomato juice and what is this real what give me some real ingredients tomato paste and this was real tomato paste and coconut milk
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.200]   Really? I mean, I knew there were gonna be other ingredients. I need it. I just was trying to use up some
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.240]   Okay, let's see what nieva says. No, they got nothing. They just got a bunch of recipes
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:41.680]   Legally healthy what legally healthy blonde creamy tomato pasta with coconut milk. Oh
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.600]   See that would be perfect. How about a life-changing 30-minute masala sauce
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:51.200]   Also life-changing anst heard off says don't doesn't take my life stop doing that right?
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.400]   How about a five ingredient? I didn't say a word vegan vodka pasta
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:01.200]   Or coconut chia pudding and there's no tomato paste and coconut chia put it. Yeah, there's no
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.720]   I would not put tomato paste
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.800]   But like those are the kind of I just it said I saw the queue was what can I make use?
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.680]   What can I make for lunch with the ingredients in my fridge? I was like, oh, that's actually something I comment like type
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.520]   Okay, see see
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.880]   But don't ask it what james web telescopes up to because that's absolutely
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.960]   No, good
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.800]   Yeah, so that one the state today
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.880]   It's actually not serving me what it should because it's linking out to recipes
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.200]   So but if it could just give me a recipe, I know for the recipe sites, it's better
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.680]   right
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.280]   You want to you want to just steal that information without going there, right?
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.120]   God recipe sites they're like the worst. I know
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:42.320]   I know like epicureus, don't you
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:47.600]   Some sites they do long articles and then they put the recipe
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:53.280]   Oh, look what they did six lines. Oh, look what they did. So, okay, so I clicked on the recipe
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.560]   This is niva for committee and it just gives me the recipe
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.600]   Okay
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.400]   And I can even send this recipe to stacy
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.840]   Okay
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:06.880]   Wait, go back
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.200]   Because wait, what did you ask it to do because it's giving me sundried tomatoes
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:14.560]   But I'm gonna make with tomato paste and coconut milk it asks
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.680]   Click that again because I don't think it was actually answering the correctly
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:20.640]   It says sundried tomatoes no tomato
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.160]   Middle pasta
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.720]   So that's not a good recipe
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.440]   It does not serve my needs
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:30.320]   It's interesting so it is extracting the recipe
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.400]   Ooh, this is weird. Look at this. It's just the recipe
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.480]   So no, no
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.480]   Wow, that's not a snippet either
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:43.200]   That's saying no, no, no, mr. Jarvis. Yeah, that's taking away traffic, isn't it? Yeah
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:49.600]   But you but but however, however for my days at a pecurious which stacy doesn't like I find out
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.240]   Their recipes aren't very good
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.720]   Look at this
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.640]   Look at this, there's super fancy and not as tasty as they should be for the effort
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.160]   Anyway, there's a debate whether or not you can copyright a recipe
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.800]   Right, so that may be what they're looking at how look at how this is formatting
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.360]   So that's ingredients and there's instructions
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:10.400]   And there's reviews all of this without going to the site
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.720]   But but I understand why because a lot of times sites will have 12 pages of article
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.200]   At the very go to the site. No, let's see how badly it's presented at the site. I'll bet this is a major improvement
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.920]   Yes, see see as we got to go through the whole life. Okay guys
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.840]   See right see life changing a lot of big pictures. Look at that awesome side lighting there on these
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.720]   Photos
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:37.360]   Well, there's the rest of there's the rest of this isn't actually bad
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.840]   Oh, you've got an ad blocker because normally what happens is they use all this because they want to have ads
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.960]   Like this would be an ad like yeah, that's what it is sure

[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:07.920]   from it
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:10.080]   Uh, barge retailer green went wacko
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.160]   Uh all kinds of accusing you l roth of terrible things
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.400]   Was she wearing that really good looking uh faux fur coat that she wore last night? That was
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.880]   That was attractive
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.760]   And kiersten cinema would look like she was wearing the chinese balloon
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.480]   Yeah
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.880]   But just you know topical former twitter executives former by the way
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.640]   Yes, uh
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.920]   Testify on the hearing of the hunter biden laptop story yo al roth
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.200]   So give us a summary the kind of unbiased
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.760]   Uh summary, oh i'm not gonna be unbiased at all the republicans are out to make a lot of attention and go they're going crazy
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.960]   Uh trying to accuse twitter of doing bad things and the democrats are making fun of them
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:54.560]   And uh the poor twitter people just had to suffer through the day
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.440]   So twitter
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:05.840]   This is in weeks before the november 2020 presidential election they limited the spread of the post articles about
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.960]   The hunter biden laptop 24 hours later. They did allow users to share links to the articles
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.560]   The main
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.920]   New york post account was suspended for two weeks for refusing to delete its initial tweets
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.160]   Right and roth y'all roth said that he said at the time that was a mistake
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:28.080]   Um and then they came back, but it was the that the time was the belief it was the hacked information
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.120]   Here's the tester money the hack of the dnc
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.640]   Here's the tester money says at first glance the story bore a lot of similarities
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.880]   To the 2016 russian hack and leak operation targeting the dnc
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.520]   We had to decide what to do and in that moment with limited information. We made a mistake
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.280]   He said decisions aren't straight for these decisions aren't straightforward
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.040]   And we wanted to avoid making the same mistakes as in 2016
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.480]   um
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.960]   So
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.320]   You know, it's not inappropriate to ask these questions
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.160]   But the way they were asked it's kind of it's a little bit, you know
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.320]   And then the funny thing was they're trying to accuse the democrats of interfering
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:14.480]   And they got the twitter executives to say all the times the trump tried to get twitter to take down whoops post
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.040]   Whoops
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.360]   Yeah, sometimes you don't want people to talk
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.320]   Yeah, big tech. This is james komer
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.120]   The uh chair of the committee
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:32.880]   Big tech autocrats wheeled their unchecked power to suppress the speech of americans to promote their preferred political opinions
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.720]   And stein
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:42.000]   I think on the left or the right most people. I mean if they're using twi i'm sorry aunt really is dying isn't he?
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.720]   Is more grandstand and crap from our government officials that we
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:55.760]   Allegedly voted for it do nothing but just sit and yell and want to look pretty and nothing gets done
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.320]   Not a dank thing ever gets done
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.800]   Something has gotten done
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:09.520]   The us government is working hard on cyber security and we have this yeah word
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.520]   um
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.800]   On there was actually a story about let's see sisa
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:21.760]   Let's here we go. Is this the high this last week is this the high this is kill net kill net?
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.080]   Okay, it's a new one. What's the high story? Hold on. Let me let me see if you've got a story
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:33.280]   Uh, well the high stories from last week that was when the fbi and other international law enforcement took down the russian malware
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.920]   um
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.400]   Kind of as ran from where is this service?
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:45.520]   Uh group hive, but this is another one kill net d doss this is a new one. Yeah. Yeah, and they're they're they were going after hospital
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.600]   And sisa sisa sorry I said it. Oh sisa
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:55.440]   Sisa was created as part of our efforts to we were like holy cow cyber security is a total mess
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:02.400]   This is terrible. Um, and they created this agency a couple of years ago and they've actually funded it and it does things
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:07.040]   And it's actually helping solve this so and then also so that's good
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.680]   but too
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.880]   As part of the omnibus bill, we actually passed a cyber security law for
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:23.200]   Medical devices. So now if you want to release a medical device that is connected to the internet you a have to get it pre certified
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:30.240]   Which is a big deal like you have to run to run it through the fda and they'll be like did you pay attention to like pen testing and
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:32.080]   passwords and they'll be like
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.800]   Yes, because we have to because if you say no, they won't let you release it
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:41.360]   Too it calls for a software bill of materials. So while ant is right. There's a lot of crappy grandstanding
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.160]   There's actually a couple areas where they're actually doing something and cyber security is one of them
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:51.040]   So I am very pleased what's the health devices your is your is your fitness watch a health device?
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:56.240]   That is not because it doesn't go before for any like clearance before the
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.600]   Okay, it's a
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.560]   A fibrillator in the apple watch got fda clearance, right?
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:10.240]   Yeah, if you have it like that that particular algorithm, but that's not a device. That's a
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.840]   Be more like a pacemaker if you had a pacemaker
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.920]   Yeah, for some reason has controlled by an app and this has been a problem
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:25.120]   There've been pacemakers that could be hacked to stop your heart, which would be a bad. Well, and it also and yeah, it includes things like
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.960]   Bluetooth
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.120]   thermometers because those are five five
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.920]   I just want to say 5013 c but
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:35.960]   Not quite the same they're non-probative
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.480]   Yeah
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:45.840]   So this this is and things in hospitals like infusion pumps, which is a thing that we're super worried about. Yes, anyway, it's just
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:51.360]   Good news our government did pass it and I was kind of amazed because in this was a law that they had
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:57.280]   Had bipartisan support in april under the patch act and then it just totally died
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.680]   But they snuck it in the federal end of your budget bill in a past
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.680]   With all the things we wanted to that was the other thing
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.520]   They didn't compromise. Okay, that's all sorry
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:14.880]   This weekend enterprise tech they brought up NIST and the whole cybersecurity push
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:19.920]   But it was looks like it was directed more towards IOT which still makes sense that it
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:23.600]   They're doing government is doing something about that for cybersecurity
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.960]   I agree with that but most of the time it's just a bunch of people wanting to
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:33.200]   Wanting to be seen on camera and heard on the social medias and do much of nothing
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.000]   we have often
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.320]   Exchlorated
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:42.000]   Mr. Elon Musk so it would be it behooves me to
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.640]   Send you the information to celebrate the success of he on in his he had his day in court
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:51.360]   and found not liable
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:54.000]   Over tweets proposing to take Tesla private
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.920]   Not liable not one hour deliberation one hour. Yeah, the jury
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:03.360]   Clearly did not buy the contention
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.320]   Of it was a it was a lawsuit from investors who said hey we lost money
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:13.600]   Because of this tweet that private equity funding had been a you know
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.200]   Arranged and that he was going to take Tesla private
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:22.240]   People changed their investments based on that and it turned out not to be true
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.560]   Musk
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.680]   tweeted thank goodness the wisdom of the people has prevailed
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.920]   It is it is by the way possible to appeal this
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.720]   Four years ago the tweet i'm am considering taking Tesla private at $420 funding secured
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.480]   Which it wasn't
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.440]   He later tweeted investor support is confirmed the only reason why this is not certain is it's contingent on a
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:51.120]   Shareholder vote vote the sec find him $20 million in 2018
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.680]   Over the tweet and said from now on you got to let have a lawyer look at your
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.160]   Your tweets which he said no and he doesn't apparently still
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.320]   uh
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.840]   so
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.840]   one of the investors
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.040]   Testified this represented a threat to my livelihood
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:13.920]   Testifying his belief Tesla would go private led him to liquidate his positions
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:19.920]   But the jurors just didn't buy it they said no yes, you know, that's your own damn fault
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:27.520]   The jury formed person who said he wasn't persuaded by the arguments that the tweets were material said the overall message
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.440]   It just didn't land there was nothing in there to give me an aha moment
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.960]   This is why lawyers hate juries
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.000]   Yeah, yeah, do you agree with this?
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.360]   Oh you charted up a
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.720]   Aaha moment. I didn't know okay. Sorry. I'll work on that
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.640]   um
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.160]   During the trial tesla board members had sought to distance themselves
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.760]   From mr. Musk saying he was tweeting in his personal capacity
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.600]   That was also persuasive said one juror
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:59.440]   Uh, well, you know, eelon just was doing his own thing
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:02.800]   uh
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.640]   Joseph groond fest
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.000]   former sec commissioner professor emeritus at stanford law school
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.240]   Shocked everyone in when he said from that perspective. It's a coin toss
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:15.200]   Who wants a coin toss when you could just split the baby
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:20.000]   Um
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.920]   That was an aha moment. I guess. I don't even know why he said that mixed metaphor as much. Yeah
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.840]   Don't toss the coin split the baby
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.120]   Didn't solomon say that forget the coin toss just split the baby
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.360]   Uh, it is the first time mr. Musk's decision to part
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:45.840]   I'm reading from the wall street journal to participate in litigation rather than settle has paid off remember he won his case against the
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:49.920]   British spielunker who he called a pedo guy on twitter
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:55.600]   The jury sided with mr. Musk. It helps. I think to be a celebrity. I'm not I may be wrong
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.880]   But I think it helps to be a celebrity
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.520]   And male
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:05.680]   And they really hate women. They don't yeah, i'm a virgin say baby. She's a celebrity, but they didn't like her
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.080]   They didn't like amber heard they didn't like what's her name the tharanos lady
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:17.200]   Elizabeth homes. That's what it was in 2020. That's true. She didn't get off light delete. Did she know but these did send him ball
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.200]   Wadi so and he was a guy

[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:29.760]   he has a was suspiciously european name
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:32.160]   Sonny
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:38.720]   in 2021 mr. Musk was the lone tesla board member to go on trial in a shareholder lawsuit of the company's acquisition of
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:41.040]   solar city
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.040]   a judge ruled in his favor last year
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.280]   So
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:52.320]   Elon is is uh one is three for oh three for how do you say that you sports three and oh sir three and oh, thank you
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:54.160]   He's bat in a thousand
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.160]   bat in a thousand math is hard
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:01.520]   Or three for three if you talking baseball three for three
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:08.080]   He's over the Mendoza line wait. He's batting a thousand, but isn't a four is it a
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:11.040]   don't ask
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:14.800]   Three of three a hundred percent a hundred percent is batting a thousand
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.360]   Yeah batting a thousand is a hundred percent. Isn't there something involving four
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.440]   in baseball or am I thinking just for four four four balls your thing a walk
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.240]   right
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:31.200]   I'm thinking is there any other four? I think that's the only four
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:37.360]   No, there's four bases if you close four bases even I know that well, but it's not his home of base
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:41.920]   It's a plate. It's not a base a plate. There's three bases. Oh, this is why I hate baseball
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:47.120]   We always get into the oh wow. Okay. I'm sorry. I asked I was
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.360]   So batting averages you move the
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.240]   Right
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:59.120]   Yeah, I thought don't you have a isn't there like a four dot. Oh batting average
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:04.560]   You can have a 400 you can be bad in 400 like the you can split it split or ten Williams. You sure good
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:11.760]   Yeah, but that's but that's still 40 percent. Yeah, even the best. It's a hundred nobody hits 100. That's
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:17.840]   Okay, that's what I'm thinking of okay batting 400. Thank y'all. That was helpful
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.920]   You could be batting 450 or 350 or five 50 or 600. I got it
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:29.920]   400 one number out of I don't know a hundred of anything but elan I would rather talk about base
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:33.200]   Wow
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:36.960]   Ted Williams had a lifetime average of merely
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:39.760]   304 344
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.200]   Uh, and yet he was also considered one of the greatest baseball hitters of all time
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.920]   Tony Gwen and how do you say it? Is it a
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:49.520]   He was 0.4. No 0.4 hundred. How do you say? Well, you're
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:53.040]   You say 400 but it's printed dot 400
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.120]   Okay
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:01.680]   So that's the confusion. He was the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 in season. Mr. Splendid splittet at Williams
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:07.760]   Tony Gwen, what was his what it was his Tony Gwen was? I thought he was right there at 402
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.040]   So he was pretty pro according to the AI
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:17.680]   Uh Neva says Ted Williams was the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 in season
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:19.760]   But let me see what Tony Gwen
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.720]   Tony Gwen had because he was a great hitter as well for the balsa for the red Sox, right?
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:31.280]   Uh, pajamas. What about that dude from the Cardinals mark mark McGuire? Oh, did we?
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.280]   Yeah, but he was
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:39.360]   Tony Gwen's career batting average was 338
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.800]   Uh 338
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.440]   Okay, again amazing, right? That's really really good and it's only a third of the time
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.600]   What about puhulls?
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.920]   Didn't he just do something like a year ago?
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:53.120]   And he said well, he's in a long time
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.600]   That's st. Louis Cardinals as well
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.520]   I know that's I have a Cardinals fan in my house. I only hear about the Cardinals
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:02.880]   That's only that's the only team I ever gonna say
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.440]   pool holes batting average
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:12.800]   296 career. Oh, okay. He did something like within the last year or two that was notable
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:17.680]   But I don't know what it was. We don't have to talk about baseball anymore. He played for 22 seasons
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.920]   Yeah, he's old pretty impressive. He's uh, awesome. Yeah
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:26.080]   Well, you know pitchers and batters report soon, don't they?
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.560]   Around the quality. Oh see it's almost springtime
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:35.440]   Okay, and I'm not much of a baseball fan, but I know enough
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.800]   Albert pool holes who bats right and throws right weighs
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:46.160]   235 pounds bawne January 16th 1980 in Santo Domingo Dominican Republic
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:55.440]   Drafted by the st. Louis Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1999 major league baseball june amateur draft
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:02.640]   Mr. Jerry is there a seventh inning stretch for us here? Yes, here's your seventh inning stretch. You ready? You ready?

[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:20.000]   Boy people are gonna love this episode
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:27.360]   What the hell was that that was the brass for your announcement
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:32.880]   Well google takes life
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.960]   Okay google will soon blur
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.880]   explicit images by default in the search results
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:46.000]   So if you want to see those butts kids you better turn off that safe search
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.440]   The new setting automatically blurs. I can't believe they didn't do that before. I know
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.240]   I know
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.240]   It automatically I know
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:02.080]   It automatically blurs pornographic violent or gory images it can be disabled by anyone who doesn't have a
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.800]   supervised account
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.160]   You have to be uh signed in and over 18
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:14.000]   This is part yesterday was safer internet day. So this new default search setting for everyone
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.080]   Automatically, we'll blur those nasty images even if you have
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:23.440]   Uh, could they also blur the pimple popping things because those things pop up
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.760]   Oh, like anytime anytime I see like I have to google like a rash or something like my kid has shingles
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:34.080]   What does that look like or something? I'm like this is gonna be so horrible. I don't see that
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.480]   There's actually a tv show and I see it in the tv listings all the time
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:41.120]   Something like professor pimple and popper and I
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:47.760]   You'd want to watch that no tv show watch that by that name. I don't I'd rather watch baseball for god's sis
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:50.160]   baseball

[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.720]   How does it know you're 18 though?
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.960]   Do you know that you're eight google knows everything
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.360]   Google knows how old I am if you google my name, it'll tell you that it knows my spouse
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:07.440]   It knows and i'm never told it any of this
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:10.000]   The blur feature
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.800]   Will be a new item within the safe search menu along with the option to disable it entirely
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:19.600]   Uh, you can also optionally hide explicit texts links and pimples
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.200]   Uh
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:27.440]   Disabling safe search entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any pimples
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:34.160]   Google is adding some new features for evs with its built-in google maps
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:38.400]   It'll now suggest this is a feature that you know tesla's have in their own
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:44.080]   Uh maps, but it's it's every ev wants this it'll suggest charging stops
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:49.200]   Uh even on shorter trips. It'll include a very fast filter. This view really need
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:55.520]   When you're searching charging stations, you should be able to filter it by the charging stations that have the highest
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:58.400]   Wadded so you get the other fastest charging
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:02.880]   And it will show you in search results when a place has a charging station on site
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:08.640]   Google adding big support and google maps and knowing and it also knows what your plug is
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:14.400]   It knows what your you tell it what your plug is you tell it tell it tell you which which plug you have
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:19.280]   It knows but it's just as out of a courtesy is gonna ask yes. I think so. I know it knows perfectly well
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:23.520]   As if I didn't know what kind of plug do you have
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:27.680]   And and by the way, you're not your forties anymore. Liam knows that too
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:32.640]   So actually let me ask you if you google my name

[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:42.800]   I'm doing something right stacey. Do you have a uh wikipedia entry?
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:49.360]   No, okay, because that's where it gets all that information about me. It says you were our 44 years old and your partner is
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.920]   Andrew. Yep. Yeah, okay

[01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:58.240]   I don't know where it got it from. I've never

[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.400]   I know but I was asking to see what google showed people who weren't because sometimes google
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:18.160]   Do you want me to do it as a
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.120]   incognito or just like as me
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:26.160]   They already did it. It's all good. Yeah. Well, it's interesting to see is now. This is very fancy

[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:49.040]   Stacey gets the glam treatment. I don't get any of them. What about Leo?
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:55.040]   I don't know if I want people knowing my age if they searched me, but okay Leo gets the oh look at Leo's
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:01.760]   Do I get the glam treatment? Oh, I do. Oh, look at movies hackers wanted. That's hysterical
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:09.280]   That's the movie. I did that many years ago hackers one. That's bizarre. Nice. That's really bizarre that that came
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.360]   up. I don't know why that did
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:12.880]   Huh
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.640]   So that's what google does but i'm logged in. What if I do it as an incognito search
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:19.120]   Well, I guess it did it for you too didn't it Jeff?
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:24.240]   I'm doing it for just as myself and it pulled up the same thing of you. Yeah, if you're if you're
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:27.040]   Not much for mr. journalist though. I don't get it

[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:35.520]   They classify us as a journalist like when I when I search ant it tells me he's a journalist
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:39.520]   You know I did right, but I am so upset
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:43.280]   Oh, Jeff, let me help
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:49.360]   When I get what I type and I approve it in the event of a car accident. It's important not to keep driving
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:55.840]   Call the police if anyone is killing us. It's being called a train wreck. Why am I getting that?
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:59.440]   Oh, Jeff. It does know you it says your wife is Tammy
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:02.560]   Is that true? You've never said your wife's name
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:07.680]   You're 68. How do you survive? I know
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:11.280]   I

[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:20.320]   We were doing the we were doing the the changelog. I'm so sorry. I just I got curious
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:23.920]   So easy to get distracted from the changelog
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:29.920]   Um, it's interesting how they treat different people differently that is very odd
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:36.640]   Yeah, yeah, all right, uh back to the changelog whatever that was google has announced
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:40.560]   improved contextual translation features

[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:50.000]   No, I don't know anything about this one. So I don't know it might be my fault
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:55.120]   No, I put that one in there. I don't know google winds down feature
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:59.360]   That put oh, this is not good that put playable podcast

[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:14.400]   I'll have to go to google because I let's see what niva does this week in google
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:17.360]   So it used to be the carousel would have a
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:20.240]   latest there is a nice link
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:26.720]   Uh for some reason it's decided to tell me about google making and already knows what our stories are going to be
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.200]   Look at that
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:33.680]   Where is it getting that from?
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:35.840]   Wait a minute. The twit tv podcast
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:43.280]   Tom's guides eating at the sun.co.uk and audible.com. Hey, where is it getting that from? Are it?
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:45.920]   Does it have access to your
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.320]   No, it's probably giving us the most last week the most weekly
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:53.680]   Information from what's the biggest story in google?
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.720]   But it doesn't have a playable about last week playback so google I mean it does have a link to youtube
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.840]   I guess you know you could go there
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:04.480]   But so you're saying if I go to google it used to if I search for this we can go used to have a
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:08.960]   Well, it still does it has a carousel
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:14.800]   Hmm not for me and I can play from there. I'm just getting that
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:18.560]   Yeah
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:23.680]   That is such a dorky theme song Jesus

[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.720]   You are our king
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:37.760]   Okay, okay. We that now hello people out there somewhere in our land. You've got a
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:42.880]   Segments with us to music we need this is our new theme song. This is how you stone is that please
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:49.600]   Please don't care. You know the folks that are listening are way more talented. So do it that way if you want meanwhile
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:55.280]   And now it launches android 14 developer preview for pixel
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:07:01.440]   So if you've got a pixel and you want to take a look at the android 14 developer preview
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000]   It is out now
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.560]   This is the eighth year in a row that google provides an early look at the direction android is going ahead of
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:12.720]   The stable launch which usually happens in the third quarter
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:19.120]   For the very first release there are five tent poles
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:22.880]   Starting with working across device and form factors
[02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:29.280]   Android 14 bills on the work done in android 12 ln 13 to support tablets. Oh and foldables
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:32.160]   Oh
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:37.840]   Users will be able to scale your font up to 200 percent. That's a lot more than current
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:46.720]   A grammatical inflection api will that developers more easily add support for users who speak languages which have grammatical gender
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:52.080]   Grammatical gender yeah
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:57.040]   Okay, sorry. Yeah, okay. I was like
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:00.640]   Port
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:02.640]   to my taunt
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:07.120]   To improve privacy and security android 14 will prevent apps with targets sdk version
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:09.600]   lower than 23 which is android 6
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:13.520]   From being installed. So if you've got old apps you might want to update those
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:20.080]   Um streamlining background work anyway a bunch of new features get that developer preview
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:24.400]   Uh the new one plus phone came out yesterday
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:31.920]   Jason howl has it he did a I believe he did a review and all about android yesterday he was planning on doing that that will also appear
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.640]   Uh on our twitch
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:42.800]   Uh tech break feed now the thing that's interesting is they are not going to offer it to in any us carriers
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:49.440]   Stores including t-mobile which one plus has been offering their phones and so without us carrier support
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:53.600]   Even though this is the first one plus phone that supports 5g from all the carriers
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.000]   You kind of wonder if if really
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.640]   At this point it's it's google or sam song or nothing
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:05.920]   Uh, i-book and that's where's the
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:09.760]   That's it. It's over
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.160]   changelike we need uh kazoos for the end to
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:19.760]   There we go. It said no one ever
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.760]   jereby rules is awesome
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:27.440]   Totally totally awesome
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:35.920]   Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Let's do a final commercial and picks of the week and we can all go home
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:42.960]   I I don't know if you've noticed i'm a little feisty i'm a little i'm a little uh peppy today
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.400]   You know you know why because I got a great night's sleep got a great night's sleep
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.480]   Sleep as it has been said is nature's gentle nurse
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:58.320]   It's the ultimate game changer and my eight sleep pod cover is the ultimate sleep machine
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:04.480]   I love it consistent good sleep helps with so many health issues like
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:08.560]   It could decrease the risk of heart disease. It can lower your blood pressure
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.720]   There's even some evidence of good sleep
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:15.120]   Especially that deep sleep that cleans the brain can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:20.480]   But more and more in the 21st century, we're having trouble sleeping
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:24.480]   Let me ask you folks friends. Do you have trouble?
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:28.240]   Falling asleep. Do you wake up my friends in the middle of the night?
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:33.680]   Do you argue with your partner over the thermostat? Well, I can help you the eight sleep pod cover
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.000]   Works hard all night long to improve your sleep so you don't have to and i'm not just
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:44.800]   Blow and smoke. I have the eight sleep pod cover and lisa and i love it
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:49.360]   When we get in bed and by the way, that's the only cover that has
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:51.760]   temperature control
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:53.600]   dual zone
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:58.960]   As low as 55 degrees, that's chilly or 110 degrees. That's hot Fahrenheit
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:05.280]   Gives you the optimal temperature and each side gets their own so lisa likes it a little cozier than i do
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:11.440]   Sometimes she'll say come on just reach over to my side feel that and i go wow that's hot and she said yeah
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:14.480]   And i say reach over to my side she goes
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:17.120]   So cool i said yeah
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:19.360]   that's
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.680]   A dramatization, but you know you get the idea
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:22.960]   uh
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:24.960]   Based on your it's based on not only
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:26.560]   Your own
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.080]   Myometrics and your sleep stages. It's based on the room temperature too
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:35.200]   In fact, we save money with the eight sleep because I don't have to turn on the heat or the air conditioning at night
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:39.440]   You know the worst thing in the world summertime. It's hot sleeping hot. Nobody wants to do that
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:43.600]   But sometimes even in the winter, you know, you get chilly you turn on the heat
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:48.320]   You wake up at three in the morning and you're sweating bullets not with the eight sleep it senses
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:52.080]   Your temperature the temperature of the room and it keeps you comfortable
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.160]   And it's an interesting fact that it we want to start warm, you know
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:59.200]   We're going to bed but that as the night progresses
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:02.720]   It helps you go into deep sleep if it gets cooler a little bit cooler
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:08.080]   And your body slows down and you get and you get in that deep sleep cycle and you on average
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.720]   people who use the eight sleep cover
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.440]   Get 30 percent better
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:18.480]   Deep sleep that makes a huge difference. I was getting I'm getting about 50 percent
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:20.880]   It went from an hour to an hour and a half a night
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:23.600]   That's amazing
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.960]   It also has sensors to track your health and sleep metrics every morning and get up you can you don't have to wear anything
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:32.880]   You don't you know, it's easy. You just get up. You can look at your phone and you'll see how you slept
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:38.400]   Better sleep is the health habit you'll love sticking to night after night and everybody who's got one of these
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:41.760]   I hear from people all the time. I started with Kevin Rosie
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:45.680]   The first one to tell me about this I was a little skeptical, but then Amy Webb was on the same show
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:49.920]   This is a couple of years ago said oh Kevin. I got it. It was great. It changed my life
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:52.960]   So we got one about a year ago. We've gone through now summer and winter
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:55.280]   I could tell you you just got one didn't you?
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:56.480]   Do you like it?
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:58.560]   Be honest. Tell me the truth. It's
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.880]   Outstanding and then look at the graph. Well, you can't see it
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:06.800]   But it's show show his graph show. He's got a 90 93
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:09.120]   93 86
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.480]   Overall because I slept like a hibernating grizzly bear. It was so nice
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.200]   Oh, I love that thing so nice
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:24.400]   Better sleep. It's a health habit that you will you'll actually love, you know, you'll you'll say oh I can get into better sleep
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.320]   Sure night after night you wake up fully energized with the pod cover
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:32.720]   You could tackle whatever life throws at you. It's just the best thing ever
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:36.240]   I'm a huge fan. Lisa is a huge fan

[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:04.160]   Total time slept eight hours and nine minutes 93 percent. That's that's pretty dark for me
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:06.880]   That's that's an amazing
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.960]   I mean, I was getting 50 before we got the eight sleep pod cover

[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:08.160]   She's better than me. I can I have to admit that she's just better than me in every way
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.960]   8sleep.com/twit
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:16.160]   Uh, we thank him so much for supporting the show
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:18.080]   uh
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:21.360]   real quickly I just there's so many stories that jeff put in
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:25.280]   Hey
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:29.520]   Oh, this is one I do want to do and I want you to tell me all about this
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:32.640]   Uh, we saw this last week. It was kind of a shock
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:39.040]   We have had on this show many times Joan Donovan. We love Joan Donovan. She's an expert on misinformation
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:46.160]   She was at the uh, the shorrens team school she was a founder of the charlie shorrensine center
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:49.280]   No media of a of a cert. Yes. Go ahead media
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:52.080]   Serencing center on media politics and public policy
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:59.840]   Doing a research project. She wrote a book. This is at harvard at the kennedy school, which is their school of politics institute of politics
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:04.080]   Forced to leave by the dean according to sources
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:07.600]   Now I figured you'd have the inside story on this jeff
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:13.200]   I have a few inside stories. Uh, this comes right after the same deed and tried to stop kennath roth
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:19.920]   Former head of human rights watch universally respected from being a fellow there. There was outcry
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:23.120]   And roth was then made a fellow
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:30.880]   Earlier, uh, there were earlier activities that were at the kennedy center including, uh first draft which was major major
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.280]   Important entity and disinformation was kind of forced out
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:39.520]   Idb wells nicole hanna jones's center was forced out
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:43.920]   Um, that was a whole story a while ago same dean as far as I know
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.720]   And then jones forced out and the argument they're making is that
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:51.520]   um
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:55.840]   Centers at harvard are supposed to be run by faculty and she's not tenured track faculty
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:58.240]   And so she really can't do this now
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:02.160]   They've known that she wasn't tenured track faculty for eight for years and she's but went there
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:07.120]   She was never tenured three years or four years ago. No, she was there as a researcher not a professor
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:12.640]   Um, one view is uh, the semaphore did more reporting on it
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:18.000]   Uh, one argument is that she got into a tiff with former facebook executive
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.720]   Um, I doubt that that's it
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:26.160]   Uh, we really just don't know and uh, i've seen it again and again and again harvard is just a
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:28.720]   not nice place
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:30.720]   tensions rose
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.160]   Between the dean and donovan and fall of 2021 according to three. This is from the crimson
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:38.640]   harvard's own student publication
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:45.680]   Three hks staff members around when donovan started to work on the kennedy school's facebook archive project fbr
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:49.920]   Dot org because they wanted to she wanted to put
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.840]   all of the whistle blowers documents from frances b hogging in
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:19:01.200]   And was informed maybe you shouldn't now at roughly the same time
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:06.640]   Mark succuber committed half a billion dollars to harvard's neuroscience and ai institute
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:13.840]   So maybe there's a connection maybe not but this is harvard's, you know, favorite son big donor
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:18.400]   And he just happens to run facebook and here's somebody
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:25.200]   Uh, who's in charge who's a researcher? I miss information wants to add in misinformation information from facebook
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:30.960]   And this facebook archive dot org, uh site. Joan herself has not made a comment
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:34.400]   Uh and has not said anything about this at all as far as I know
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:39.680]   No, I I email her just to say thank you navya and she said there were other people who could tell the story
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:42.320]   Uh, there's there's a largest story here. This interesting
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:44.000]   gang
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:52.160]   Which is that you know, and I I got money from my school got money from facebook to deal with disinformation stuff back in the day after 2016
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.160]   And now
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:20:01.280]   Disinformation ain't cool anymore as a field. I know one major think tech is moving away from it first draft is no longer doing this
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:05.520]   Joan is kicked out of of here. There was a there was a
[02:20:05.520 --> 02:20:08.560]   international communications association
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:11.120]   Conference in paris
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:16.000]   Asking what comes after disinformation research. Uh, it's kind of had its big day
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.720]   And so that's an interesting
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:20.320]   Question
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:23.360]   Of was it wasn't seen as a fad was it seen as?
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:30.800]   Cambridge, analytical wasn't that bad after all? It's over. We don't have to worry about it. It's nothing like covid. It's like covid
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:32.480]   They're the same way
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:39.520]   Joan did important work. I don't agree with everything. She says jones brilliant. She's brave. She's been you know, she's she's
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:47.440]   Uh going after people who are not nice people and we need someone like jon to do this and it sucks majorly. Yeah
[02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:49.680]   Um
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:53.520]   I hope some other school picks her up and says yeah, you know what this needs to be done
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:56.640]   There's a great research or something we need to research super smart
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:20:59.600]   Sometimes we always want to have her on all
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:04.000]   She may not want to be on right now, but i'll ask her we'll ask her to get her on soon, but um
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:10.240]   Actually, you're not here next week. Are you? I guess we got next week. No, we got mike elgin already. Yeah, next yeah
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:13.200]   Uh, facie's not here that we can't i'm not here in two weeks
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:16.880]   Hey, maybe jason howl you could contact Joan and see if we get her on
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:21.040]   It was already on the case. Oh, he says i already have just waiting to hear back
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:26.000]   And you can tell her if you don't want to talk about this you don't have to but we do want to talk about misinformation
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:33.360]   Uh, and you know, this is academia, you know jeff you're you're mired in academia. Oh, tell me about it. It's
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:36.320]   It's very political, uh, and
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:41.200]   You know, it may not even be malicious. It's it's just you know
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:45.360]   It's just what happens. I grew up in academia. My dad's a professor
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:50.000]   That's just what happens, but still i think jones should find a seat somewhere
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.480]   She's she's a very important ship give her
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:55.360]   Give her a profession
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.360]   She's a researcher. Yeah, that's great
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.920]   And she's funny
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:01.680]   She's smart
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:05.680]   Yeah, importantly to me. She's smart. I'll do the funny
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:09.040]   Uh
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:14.000]   All right, let's get your pick of the week stacy hingabothum. What do you like? What do you see? What do you know?
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:21.120]   All right, this is an app. This is a little late because I didn't do dry january because I was sick
[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:25.040]   But I'm doing you dry february because what is that you can
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:31.280]   What is that because you can because I can yeah, it just is basically like not drinking all
[02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:36.720]   But just for a month every reason and by the way, I want to point out the shortest month of the year
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:42.400]   Yes, all of this is true
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:47.120]   Although if we think about it, I haven't had a drink in like a week and a half at least so you know
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:50.720]   I feel like i've already started you better make your own month stacy
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:59.760]   Day to date it's a month. You declare my so why just my goal is what i'm saying is what's what do you get from just not drinking for a month?
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:06.800]   So actually so far my heart rate variability that was one of my goals. Oh just to see what happened increased
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:10.480]   Yeah, yeah, and so and you know I
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:16.720]   Also, I was like, you know, I drink a lot when i'm bored or just to mark like the end of the day and i was like
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:18.880]   That's not good. That's a bad. Um, yeah
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:25.440]   Yeah, and I don't I don't I mean like I was drinking maybe seven or eight drinks a week, but it still felt like
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:30.880]   I did no not November and I haven't had a nut since it's it once you do it
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:35.680]   It's easy. It just gets it gets you it teaches you that you can right?
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:39.040]   I've I've had a no ruffles sprouts here
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:43.600]   I have brussels sprouts right down in my fridge
[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:46.160]   Oh sprouts
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:54.000]   Um, so to to do this and possibly to like help me just instead of like because eventually I would like to drink again
[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.960]   Right, like it's very easy to be like i'm not going to drink for a month. I would like someday
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:03.280]   That's a good ambition someday. I would like to drink again
[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:12.000]   The point is I would like to drink mindfully as as the kids say so very good. I have this
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:19.280]   I tried this app. It's called sunny side mindful drinking and it it's 15 days for free
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:23.760]   But then you pay I think it's like nine bucks a month or like 80 bucks a year
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:28.080]   Um, but it's actually text it can be all text based
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:31.440]   You don't actually have to use the app and you just text it and you're like hey
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.880]   It it offers you like you take a quiz. It'll be like this is how much you should be drinking
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:38.720]   But you can also just set your own parameters
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:44.720]   So if you say like hey, I want to have five dry days a week and drink only two drinks
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:49.280]   What you do is you text your goals to the app and you're like
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:53.680]   Hey, I want to drink two drinks today because i'm going out for a party or whatever
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:55.760]   But I only want to drink two
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:00.160]   Then it basically sends you a text and it's like hey, did you only drink two drinks and you're like
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:03.360]   No, I drink three and then it's like oh well here here's how to help you
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:05.920]   Stick to your goals and all of this stuff
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.120]   It is kind of nice like the same way writing down what you eat kind of helps you not eat stupid food
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:13.840]   It helps me anyway. This is helping
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:19.920]   Me well, it's not helping me at this moment, but I can see it helping me
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.560]   It's like new it's like no for booze. I mean i mean noom is evil
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:27.760]   Well noom is so i'd like to argue with
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:36.800]   Noom only tracks noom only put you in like the least amount of calories you can eat. It's so normally harmful
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:38.000]   That's not true you get to choose
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:43.120]   Uh, there's a little bunny and there's a there's a cheetah. I've seen it. I looked at it
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:48.800]   I looked at noom. Yeah, Lisa and I both do noom and we i've known many people including briano who lost 100 pounds
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:56.000]   One of our one of our regulars in our club twit lost 60 pounds. He was on our cruise. I I saw him
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.080]   I said I was looking for him. I said where are you you're not on the cruise. He says i'm right next to you
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:04.480]   I just he's like what the hell it's not that half of you is gone
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:06.400]   so
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:11.440]   You can you don't have to like noom, but I we we've new reactivated and eating disorder
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:18.080]   So I was not please. Oh, that's a different you know what you shouldn't do noom if you're having eating disorder. I completely agree with you
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:21.360]   You know what i'm like you know, it's not helpful. No
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:25.040]   Similarly if you're an alcoholic, I wouldn't use sunny side
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.680]   I mean that is that is something to say if yeah if this is an issue for you
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:32.240]   This is not the app but if you're just like hey
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:37.760]   I noticed my drinking is getting out of hand and I'd like to like be a little bit more accountable about it without like
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:42.240]   I don't know telling my spouse or having someone like try to nag me about it
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:48.080]   This is just nagging the attacks you if you if you have an eating disorder. I pretty sure they do they say no
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:53.440]   Don't use them when I took the quiz it it was like here's how you will achieve your goals
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:56.960]   And it was like you will eat 1200 calories a day and I was like
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:00.400]   You go crazy. I see my goal is
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:08.160]   I just don't want to be a fat tubby guy and so that was my goal was I just I get a couple of pounds a year
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:10.640]   That's fine. You can set your goal during the quiz
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:17.760]   It pushes you like during the intro quiz. It's like i'm like I would like to lose half a pound a week
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:20.240]   And it's like oh
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:22.480]   You know, and I would like to lose a total of 15 pounds
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:27.920]   Yeah, that's reasonable because you do that but it was also it was like but you could be at this weight
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:32.240]   Not in june, which is one option but april if you do this
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:39.280]   Lisa who's on kind of maintenance lost I think five or ten pounds. She didn't need much to lose much and it's kept it off
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:46.080]   And I think she of course she's not if something says oh you should do this differently. She goes no. Thank you
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:50.320]   I'm gonna do my way. So she is not easily pushed into something
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:55.840]   But god, yeah, if you had if you've got a meaning disorder, you should probably stay away from most diets, right?
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:58.000]   I mean that seems like a bad idea
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:03.360]   Yes, I'm sorry to insult your sponsor. No, you can insult them. No, I think that's fair
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:08.320]   I'm like it was not it was not a good option for me. No, this is my app
[02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.720]   like that i'm playing with and
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:13.440]   I really like it. It is a lot of texting
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:15.840]   uh, so I will let you know that
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:18.640]   I like the texting because
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:20.880]   I hate apps
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:23.040]   And you don't have to use the app. You can just do everything
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:28.880]   On the website or on an app. I mean there is an app. So if you hate a lot of texts, this is not for you a lot
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:31.040]   uh through the day
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:32.560]   um
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:34.560]   it can
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:36.160]   um
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:41.280]   It basically you tell it in the morning like hey, this is my goal for the day. Okay. And then it'll ask you
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:42.720]   Yeah
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.960]   Did you did you meet your goal and then you're like no or yes
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:53.200]   Um, and then it does it again the next day. Is it does it free? Is it charged charge anything?
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:55.440]   um 15 days free and then
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:00.400]   There's a variety of plans that range from like nine to I think 12 dollars a month
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:06.480]   Depending on how long you do it. So that's just you know, I've been playing around with it. I thought it was good
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.680]   For a dryish february
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:16.320]   Sunny side they call it they call it if you if you want to drink it's a damp february or a damp january
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:18.640]   You know, I think uh
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:23.840]   Mindful is always good whether whatever you're consuming mindful is a great idea. I agree 100 percent
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:25.840]   sunny side
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:27.200]   dot
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:28.640]   Co co
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:30.640]   It's dot co. Sorry. Yes
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:36.560]   Mr. Jeff. Jovis you have a number of the way can we can we play the google super bowl commercial
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:39.440]   Uh sure
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:40.880]   line 58
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:42.160]   Sure
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:44.160]   uh, we'll just um
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:46.160]   edit it out of the youtube
[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:49.520]   Really? Yeah, then we won't do it. No, no, no, no, I insist
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:54.720]   No, no, no, I don't know. I don't like to have the chilling effect
[02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:57.520]   commercial you gotta take out
[02:29:57.520 --> 02:30:01.120]   these companies are everything and
[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:07.200]   Uh, if we put anything. Yeah, almost certainly they'll do a takedown. So we take that in almost everything
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:11.200]   Yeah, they'll take anything down. This has music in it. They'll take it down
[02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:15.760]   So what we do though, I mean, obviously we don't get taken down from our podcast feed
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:20.000]   So we do with anything we put on youtube. We just turn it into a slideshow without audio
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.400]   So if you're watching on youtube
[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:26.960]   Subscribe to the podcast so you get the full thing. It's called fixed on pixel
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:30.880]   Right, so it's actually there's an interesting piece here
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:33.680]   to it. Yeah
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:37.440]   The joke is you could you could erase things from images
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:40.080]   right. Yep
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:42.080]   so then
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:48.480]   Um, uh, uh, maybe shumler says oh then I can erase all my boyfriends from the past
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:51.040]   We gave it a joke
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:57.280]   But what's interesting to me in all this time of you know, oh deep fakes and fake news and and how you know, what's real
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:01.360]   I haven't really seen this this really kind of brings it home that wow, you know
[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:05.840]   I just this is nothing new in this but the way it's advertised. I did it
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:09.360]   Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Nothing new in this
[02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.000]   Nope, nope, but it kind of makes it say oh boy. This is going to be everywhere
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:20.160]   So it was interesting that it was it was that so just so you know, uh, super bowl commercial this year is seven million dollars for 30 seconds
[02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:25.760]   Uh, they will probably air this multiple times the full commercials a minute and a half 21 million dollars
[02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:30.480]   But a lot of times they don't air the full commercial right they are snippets
[02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:34.720]   We'll air the full commercial and I will only charge google half what they would pay
[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:38.880]   For the super bowl. So how about that? But you don't need to air it now. I just described it. It's fun
[02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:44.000]   For years our phones have captured memories
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:51.280]   Oh, there's a picture of a bride and her husband a young mom on the ski slope with her son
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:57.760]   Family on the beach and a brother with his sister, but now it's time to fix them
[02:31:57.760 --> 02:32:03.600]   Missy lea taking the other kid out of the picture
[02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:06.000]   Taking this dog
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.520]   Open out of the ski slope taking the fat guy with the frisbee out of the family picture on the beach
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:15.840]   And who needs the groom when you got the bride? I can erase my exes
[02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:20.240]   All the exes
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:26.160]   One dunk
[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:29.920]   That's a famous sports athlete
[02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:37.200]   kissing t-shirts
[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:39.360]   and an old man in the pool
[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:43.760]   and a person named doja cat
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:49.680]   A sad off-key harmonica plays we run this
[02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:53.760]   Oh, that's cool
[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:56.640]   It's fixed it animates it fixes
[02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:59.360]   Totally awesome. It's totally awesome
[02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:04.960]   This is a lot of the same stuff they said when the phones was launched last year on the six
[02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:08.720]   Good point. It's good point
[02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:16.240]   It doesn't have to be new for you. I found your coffee machine at online 86. Oh really sir. There's more

[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:41.760]   Is using a telescope? No
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:44.720]   It's the scale

[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:50.480]   Look at that everything's perfect
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:54.960]   Every step has a purpose. What's a filter in there?
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:00.000]   This that's dope. It has that thing had a magnet
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.200]   So cool, I mean for 10,000

[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:16.080]   It's a flea? This is the best part. Yeah, that's the oh look at that. Hey, express the machine. We use your own muscle
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:23.120]   Oh, you do it by hand. That was good. It looks a little orange to be honest. Yeah, I would have to camp that I would
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.120]   I love this
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:28.000]   Protocol

[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:36.800]   No, no, I don't know. I have no desire to get to get a flea. I'd rather have a machine like
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:44.080]   Do you don't want to work your biceps or triceps or whatever bus I get I get enough work on my biceps. Don't you were

[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:09.440]   To to pull your pull your espresso yourself. Look at that. Yeah, it's like a pomegranate squeezer
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:12.000]   Only it's espresso
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000]   Is it better that way?
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:17.840]   I mean, why don't I let the machine do it?
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:25.040]   I guess uh sometimes the machine can be inconsistent. Yeah, I mean this has a little be consistent with the flare
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:27.280]   I'm inconsistent. I'm too weak to do it
[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:32.560]   If you're grinding it right you won't get the right pressure either. Oh, that's true
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:37.680]   And then it shows you a little pressure there was a pomegranate juicer y'all. Oh, yeah
