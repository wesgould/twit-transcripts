[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Somebody said we should just rename it Twit2, the second Twit of the week.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The crows are calling. I hope it's not a crow with three eyes.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's Kevin Marks out in his garden once again.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Hey, Kevin, good to have you.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Hi, then. I have to see you again.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Our honorary irregular. He's of the irregulars, the Twig irregulars.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Jeff Jarvis is... Yeah, we love having you. Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Always.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   You're in Brussels, Lucille.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Brussels. I flew in this morning, spoke this afternoon. I fly back tomorrow.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Is this where the sprouts come from?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I think that comes from some strange nuclear reactor somewhere.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   They're not made in nature.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, we know which side you fall on in the Brussels sprouts.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Oh, God, cannot stand that.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Isn't it funny? I love Brussels sprouts. Lisa hates them too.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I do too. I love them. Gina, you love them too?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I do. I do. I embrace the healthy food.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah. I like Brussels sprouts.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah. Brussels sprouts.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Brussels sprouts. Yes.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Gina Trapani is in Brooklyn.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I am.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Still with the paneling. You know what happened?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Still in my mom's basement. Yeah, you know, we got the internet hooked up,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   but you know, the reality of doing construction in a home with an 18-month-old
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   baby who has to nap during the day.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Kind of like a thank-it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I love it. A blogger who's actually in her mom's basement.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Actually, my mom's basement. So it's going to be a couple more weeks
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   before we're in the new place.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So you can enjoy it.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   My kids... Gina, my kids got so used to the hammering that when it left,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   they couldn't sleep.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Here's all the noise, Daddy. The noise stopped.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Now the scary monsters are going to come.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Well, it's good to have all of you.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   All of you here, we were all talking about House of Cards, of course.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That is the geek topic of the hour of the week of the year.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   But no spoilers. We won't do that to you.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You know, you say the slightest thing.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And I will get hate tweets for days.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   People are very... I don't blame them.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I mean, I wouldn't want to give away the ending of it or anything.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   But the thing is, there needs to be a statute of limitations.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   There is none. We discussed this, and there is none as far as I can tell.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And there should be.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Now, it's true detective time, right?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Because the last episode of True Detective is on Sunday.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And the debate rages of whether this is a crap show or a great show.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And I'm not sure myself.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I so couldn't bear McConaughey's Oscar speech that I don't care how good the show is.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   People were saying, "Why is it going to act?"
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Or, "I just cannot bear the guy. I just can't."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It was the strangest speech. And declaring yourself your hero is very odd.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   But I give him a lot of slack because I just love the guy.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I thought he was a brilliant and dial-aspires club, deserved the Oscar.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And I'm really liking him in True Detective.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But anyway, haven't we got on next season?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Right? I think it was the rest of our episode.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I don't think Woody Harrelson will be there either.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But the real debate is, is it just a police procedural in ghosts clothing?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Or is it actually going to be something different and weird?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And we really won't know to the last episode, I think.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   So I should be watching this.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   You should watch it. It's really good in the beginning, although some say slow.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But dramatically interesting in the acting is just wonderful.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Do you watch Banshee?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   No.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Howard Stern said he liked it, and I just started watching it.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I never heard of it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Cinemax.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Oh, I don't get to get a Cinemax.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Well, I don't either, but I bought it on the Play Store.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I don't have to check it out.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Because I need airplane watching.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And it's like a download.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yes, exactly.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You know, I think we live in a brave new world where I think that these long form
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   episodic television shows, dramatic episodic television shows are Dickensian in ways.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   They're like Dickens novels.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It also reminds me of my days as a TV critic because I used to have to watch the miniseries
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   straight on through.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   The worst torture of my entire career was A.D.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I don't even remember it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Was it about Jesus?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   No, it was kind of horrid roams.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Coligula with no sex.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It was the most incredibly boring thing on Earth.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The Legula with no sex.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   That's the point.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The point.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Oh, God.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   24 hours.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   24 hours.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I interviewed, because I've sung the praises of this book.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's by a guy, Brett Martin, who writes for GQ and New Yorker and Vanity Fair.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   He's a feature writer, but he wrote a book about the Sopranos.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He calls it the third gold-in-a-major television.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   He says he's very grateful that he's not a television critic because of that very reason.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Especially now, you'd have to watch Sopranos.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You could watch maybe one or two or three episodes.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   However many they'd produced before the opening.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   But now you'd have to watch the entire cigars before you could review it.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   That'd be tough.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I used to have to fight to get episodes of things and scream the publicists.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I would scrape together and not have enough to review.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Now you can do it the way people ought to do it, which is, "Hey, I never saw a band.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   She just looked at it."
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   "Wow, it looks interesting to you."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   "What do you think?"
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   "You could do that now."
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Right.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And buy the whole thing.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I guess we could mention the Oscars, since there is a Google angle in this Samsung paid
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   a considerable amount of money.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I think it was one point.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Do we know what the business deal was?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Was she paid for it or not?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   What I read in the Wall Street Journal, and I think they probably have some good sources.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   First of all, Samsung bought five minutes of TV time on the Academy Awards.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   That's worth about $20 million at $1.8 million per half minute.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   When Ellen said, "You know what would be fun is to do a selfie," the producers, the ABC
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   producers said, "Oh."
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Right.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And she initiated that during the last time.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It was her idea to do it as content.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   She said she wants to do selfies throughout.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   She's huge on Twitter.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   She's very active on Twitter generally.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   She's very kind of connected to the digital.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   She said, "I want to do selfies throughout the show with celebrities."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And then it sounds like Samsung said, "No, okay."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Well, she used her iPhone backstage.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   She or her team, we don't know who--
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Those weren't service.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It was her assistant at the iPhone.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I mean, she has a team.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I was such a sad thing when I learned that George Ticay, Mr. Sulu, does not create his own
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   social media entries.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   He's speaking at South Bay.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I hope somebody asks him about that.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And I would imagine that anybody as big as Ellen.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   In fact, her Twitter handle is not Ellen DeGeneres.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's The Ellen Show.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Right.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It's definitely her show writers in the show.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   It's people.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It's her people.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It's her people.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It's funny.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It's good.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Oh, it's gross.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Her YouTube channel is perhaps one of the most watched YouTube channels.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It's right up there because people want to see the clips and stuff in any event.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So she wanted to do the selfie.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The journal says the ABC producers said, "Well, can you use this Galaxy Note 3?"
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I can barely lift that.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   It's huge.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And the nice thing about the Note 3 is very distinctive.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   As soon as she lifted it up, I saw the white pleather with the stitching and the sides of
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   it.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I said, "Rightly so."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I said, "Note 3."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I knew immediately.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And then I imagine quite a few geeks did.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And then apparently a Samsung representative was brought in to train her how to use it.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.800]   The first selfie she shot right at the beginning was all blurry.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:27.000]   But then you've got to admit, inspired moment when she gets these great movie stars to gather
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.480]   the quality was going on.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.720]   But it was funny how she didn't, Bradley, wanted to take the picture.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.440]   She's like three times started to stop.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.720]   I'm thinking, "Did she get paid more if she takes the picture?"
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   No.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   Is it copyright?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   Yeah, well.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   I think it's just a coincidence.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.200]   Believe it or not, there have been blog posts that because Cooper took the picture, it is
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.840]   his.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   Not hers.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.440]   You're not really interested in the production about the copyright.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:54.620]   Yeah, Vivian Schiller, who's now in executive at Twitter, was speculating about that on Twitter.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.920]   Did you also see the saddest picture on Earth?
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.360]   I just put it up on the rundown chat.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.600]   Oh, it's the saddest thing on Earth.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   Oh, where did you put it?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   I've got to find it.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.360]   On the rundown chat to the side, I put the link.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   The saddest.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.600]   Oh, I don't see it.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   I don't see it there, too.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.440]   Where did you see it?
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   I heard her turn.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   There it is.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   There it is.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   Sorry.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   Buzzfeed.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.160]   So she was a few rows back.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.760]   Ellen was sitting on Meryl Streep's lap.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.680]   Oh, this is like one of them.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   Buzzfeed, Jiff's.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.480]   Yeah, as you go down.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   There it is.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   The blue dress.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.080]   Oh, she's standing there, but you can't see her because she's four foot tall.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.440]   She's trying to crave.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:50.380]   Oh, and it's funny because she went there's the Oscar winning actress from 12 years of
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.660]   slave Lupita is in the back there.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.040]   Her brother was in the front.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   He got really got the exposure.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   Right.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.040]   Having space.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   He's making up.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   He doesn't want to lose Lupita as if she'd known her for decades.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   Of course.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   Well, that's Hollywood.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.560]   You know, have you ever been to the Oscars, Jeff?
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   I'm backstage.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   Yeah, covered him.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560]   Yeah, I figured.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.360]   I had to wear a tux.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.360]   Wow.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   Must be quite the scene.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.200]   Well, this was so many years ago, my children.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.800]   It wasn't quite the scene it is now.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.280]   It was fun.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.880]   Huge ratings, huge tweets.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.200]   Oh, I don't know what the current count is.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.480]   It was close to three million retweets of that selfie yesterday.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.000]   Yeah, 3.2 million retweets.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Wow.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.320]   1.8 million favorites.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.640]   The most the most retweeted of all time.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.120]   Yeah, like blue a Barack Obama is most retweeted.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.360]   I wonder what Ellen DeGeneres' cloud score.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.400]   Oh, he's.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:59.800]   And if anybody cares or no, I did see a heat map, actually, on Cloud's blog, of course.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   Here's the impact of 3 million retweets on your cloud score.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.360]   So there's the tweet.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   There's the people in it.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.040]   I love Jared Leto, who's trying to get in there.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.640]   Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.240]   Shane Angelina Jolie's face is partially blocked, though.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.760]   Kevin Spacey's doing the weirdest photo bomb in there.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   There's Lupita Way in the back.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.320]   Anyway, her cloud score.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.960]   Here's the heat map.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   Geez.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   Oh, gosh.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   So now this is supposedly an animated GIF.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:40.160]   So when she does the tweet, watch the explosion as she gets retweeted, it suddenly goes nuclear.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   Well, that's funny.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.320]   The West Coast took a little time to catch up there.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   Yeah, we're three hours.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.320]   Running from the East Coast.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   Actually, it's a little bit of life.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.320]   Yeah, it's spread.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   Oh, it was live.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.160]   But people are still eating dinner, and it's early on the West Coast.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   I actually was.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   This is not there.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.280]   I was-- she said, OK, every retweet this.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.280]   We'll see if we can break the record.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.520]   And I got sucked into it.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   I almost did.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.520]   And then I said, didn't do it.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.520]   I totally did it.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.520]   I was like, did you?
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   I told me to.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520]   Absolutely.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   Ellen told me to.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   Ellen is my spirit guide, man.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520]   I'm a fan.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.520]   I'm on a back.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   I'm a whole thing.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   I would do anything.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   I love her.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   Basically, whatever Ellen says I would do.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520]   It's true.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.920]   And I remember going to see her in San Francisco when she was a little-known comic and had
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.520]   these long, discursive stories that were just-- I thought it's hysterical.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520]   But at the--
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.200]   Yeah, I've seen her do stand up too.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.800]   At the other cafe in San Francisco.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.720]   Wow, that's quite something.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.000]   She said triumphantly, we broke Twitter, not realizing that's not an accomplishment.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I think that's--
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.440]   I broke a Twitter, you broke it.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   Everybody's broke a Twitter.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   I don't know.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   Whatever.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   I hadn't had a fail-whale in a while, though.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.200]   That's true.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:56.040]   So Wall Street Journal conjectured that this was perhaps more valuable than the Samsung
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.720]   ads on the Oscar.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   Was it?
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.880]   Do you think you've got news coverage?
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.840]   Do you think you've got news coverage too?
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.920]   Every local TV station was putting it up there.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.440]   The earned, as they say, coverage was huge.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.400]   I feel like the greater value is making selfies a legitimate sort of cultural--
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   Oh, my God.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.560]   They're all ready.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.000]   President Obama did it with Angela Merkel, I mean, or whoever.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.080]   The Danish Prime Minister.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.960]   There was no Samsung hashtag.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.400]   Nobody except us is going to look at the back of that phone.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   That's right.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.720]   And know what it's a Samsung phone.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.760]   It was clear that it was not an iPhone, right?
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.640]   Because you can kind of tell-- I feel like I'm trying to channel a normie, as Chad was
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.600]   calling him Westland on all about Android and normal.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.120]   I would know that it's not an iPhone.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.120]   It looked big, right?
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.120]   Big and white.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.320]   She had a white suit on it kind of matched.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.320]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.240]   I don't know if it was a good thing for Samsung.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.480]   I thought it was interesting that she hashtag the first photo blurry, which I felt like
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.080]   was her kind of way to kind of make fun of the fact that--
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.440]   --what it was like, I don't know how much that helped Samsung.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.360]   There have been a lot of-- it's a meme now.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.440]   There have been a lot of animated GIFs.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.600]   This is-- they live--
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   [SCREAMS]
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   Oh, sorry.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:16.000]   There's one with Kevin Spacey and all the faces.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.040]   If Bradley's arm was longer, he did get the copyright, though.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.440]   3.2 million retweets, 1.8 million favorites.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.680]   Now, I just put up also on--
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   That's the other one.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.480]   Now, that's the first one.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.320]   She needed more training, apparently.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   Right.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.560]   Now, does that have a hashtag or anything?
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.200]   Does that say-- no, none of it says Samsung.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   Sorry.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   So--
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   I think she could-- well, hey, secondly, there are FTC laws about this.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   That if it was paid for, you got to reveal it.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.360]   If it just came along as value add to buying five commercials and second most expensive
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.240]   event you can buy, then I think it's less paid placement.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.360]   I think that that proves that she did not get any extra.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.560]   Well, here's the question.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.040]   Does the host get paid or do the host the Oscars?
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   I don't even know.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   Does the network pay the host the way that it's going to be--
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   Of course.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   It's a job.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   Right.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   But it's a lot of work.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.160]   I know, but it's also spotlight.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.680]   I presume they got paid.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.880]   Does she get paid extra to do that?
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   It's a union event.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.880]   She got paid.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.080]   They donated money to her charities.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.760]   Samson did that after that selfie.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   Oh.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.760]   Oh.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.760]   No, that's right.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.200]   Because she gave away Samsung Galaxy Notes on her show to everybody in the audience and
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.680]   announced that Samsung was going to give a buck per retweet up to $3 million to her
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   charity.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.080]   So $3 million was raised.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   That's pretty cool.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.760]   Now, meanwhile, Twitter put up a chart-- which I put this in also in the rundown.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:05.080]   The anatomy of a tweet, one tweet, 13,000 embeds, 2.4 million retweets at the time.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.320]   8.1 million saw it.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.720]   And then it has this other weird stat.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.280]   I've been going back and forth with Twitter.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.200]   32.8 million total views.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.440]   And I'm saying to Twitter, I don't understand the difference between that and people who
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   saw it.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   Well, those are uniques, 8.1 million.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And then the total views, each of them looked at it roughly four times.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.640]   Well, but that doesn't make any sense.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.040]   This is not like a pass along for a magazine.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.280]   Well, but that's like saying I saw the New York Times on the kitchen counter.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.200]   My wife moved to the couch I saw it again.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.560]   Thus, I saw it twice.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.720]   It's not like a pass along rate of more people seeing it, which is what you do with a magazine
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   on people's magazines.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.640]   But the point is it's reinforcement.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.800]   So it's like multiple impressions of an ad.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   Right?
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.320]   So it gets more baked into your head if you see it four times, you see it once, which is
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.480]   one of the things that they say the reason they're being fine more.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.000]   So we count impressions and we count uniques and they're two different things.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.120]   That's not unfair.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   But boy, Vivian Chilis.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.800]   Michael, how's it trying to figure it out?
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.600]   Yeah, now that's how it's kind of done digital advertising.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.600]   Anyway, I understand maybe not for circulation purposes, but in digital advertising, you count
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.320]   both uniques and impressions.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.440]   And clearly, this is very good for Twitter's monetization strategy.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.440]   They're going.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.840]   Then what I mean, I can see why Vivian Chilis is tweeting this because they had to be they
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.800]   had to be hooting that light.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.720]   Yes, Samson paid her money and we got all these free.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.640]   Yeah, I think I think Gina's right.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.800]   This was less Samsung and more in selfies and Twitter.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.440]   Twitter got probably the most promotion out of this.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.920]   No, right?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.120]   Not that they need it.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.920]   But how much would Bradley how much would Bradley have paid for Bradley Horowitz paid
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.120]   for them to say?
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.400]   OK, everybody Google plus this.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.920]   People would have said what?
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.640]   Why didn't you mean tweet it?
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.280]   Twitter and celebrities has always been one of the things that Twitter really did right.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.600]   Yeah, although early Google search is now going to let you vote for American Idol.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:17.040]   Yeah, and Facebook will offer real time voting with progress updates.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.680]   So American Idol not to show it was at one time there in the 13 season.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.920]   A little bit less popular.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.200]   But now you can.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.880]   So let me actually let me let me do this.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.800]   Let me do the search.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:38.880]   Visit Google and search for American Idol or Idol during the voting window.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]   So let's try it here during.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.880]   I don't know if we're in the voting window.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.720]   No, no, but we will be.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   We will be.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   It does.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.760]   Does it know your time zone so it adjusts?
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.760]   No, no, in fact, this is it.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.120]   I get a sponsored box at the top of the search results.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.960]   This is that thing we were talking about where there's the knowledge graph on the right,
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.560]   but there's the sponsored box and says American Idol airs tonight on Fox.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.040]   At least it isn't a giant image.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.280]   Although it could be a knowledge graph is a big.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.600]   Well, and let me show you what you will get during the voting opportunity.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.800]   You're going to get all the contestants and you're going to get to vote, I guess, by clicking
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   their heads.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   I don't know.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.840]   And goo forcing unique votes and everything.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.400]   No, no, they don't care about unique votes in American Idol.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   They don't care as many as 50 per contestant.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.280]   Yeah, you're a lot more.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.560]   But you but they all think what they care about is geolocation demographics.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.320]   Oh, yeah, that's much more valuable than a text message because it helps them plan the
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   tours.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   That makes sense.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   Where we get a lot of votes, that's where we're going to send Dexter.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:55.800]   Because a few years ago, when I was at BT, we built a to show off our mobile, you know,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   our dialing API.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.520]   We bought a vote on American Idol app for Facebook.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520]   Really?
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.040]   So you would go there during the show and you'd say one of these people four times each
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.920]   and it would do the dialing for you and make it work.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.320]   And there were two things about this.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   One was we had that bill.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.160]   The other thing is we then actually had a really good statistical sample of people.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.800]   And so we could predict the votes for next week, which was kind of fun, though, not sure
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.640]   anything, we could place bets, which was kind of a shame.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.280]   Were you pretty accurate?
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.280]   Oh, very interesting.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.080]   We got a few thousand people voting.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.880]   That was enough to get a reasonable stock sample.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.960]   But eventually they told us to stop because they because we were all the dialing was coming
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.240]   from our outbound access number and they said, no, no, we actually want the area codes.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   Right.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   Right.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   Right.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Wow, it's amazing.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.720]   It's amazing.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.160]   If you're good at manipulating this stuff, it's just a brave new world for marketers and
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.560]   researchers and data and all that stuff.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   It's amazing.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.560]   Speak.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   Speak.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   It's Samsung.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.680]   It's a little windy out there, I guess.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   Two new Samsung Chromebooks.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.880]   Where did my wind post?
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.480]   Oh, missed.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.040]   Yeah, sure.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   That's your story.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   Go ahead.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   Stick to it.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   Two new Samsung Chromebooks.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   In fact, very interesting.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.560]   They're going to make them pleather or at least one of them.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.040]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.080]   I got to get the link.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   Do you have it there?
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.600]   The channel, I can't for some reason, I can't click this link.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.520]   There it is.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.400]   One of them will be Exynos powered.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.920]   Maybe all of them will be Exynos powered.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.480]   11.6 inches and 13.3 inches.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480]   That's about three inches.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.480]   Yep.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.720]   Foe leather finish starting at 3.19.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   These are the mid, I think, we'll have to see when we get them, but I think this is perhaps
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.920]   the mid range Chromebook we've been asking for.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.920]   A little bit more.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.400]   The only thing I want is LTE.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.640]   I want Salkine to be with them.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   Oh, I'm sure that.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.640]   I mean, greedy.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.000]   I just use your phone for that.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.720]   That's true, you could do that.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   It's in the butt.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.400]   I just opened the machine and it works.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.920]   They're both based on Samsung's own arm chip, the Exynos.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.200]   They'll both have four gigs of RAM, which is probably the primary way they can be.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   It's really important.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.360]   Yeah, that's mid range.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:22.360]   There's the 11 inches, 13.66 by 768, but the 13 inch is a 1080p display, 1920 by 1080.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   Not touch.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.280]   8 hours battery life.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.080]   I'm 3.99 and 3.99.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.360]   You don't make me think about this, Leo, is that back in the glory days of Dell, I could
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.160]   have gotten the machine I wanted.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.840]   I could have said I want a touchscreen and I want LTE and I want four gigs and whatever
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.560]   happened to those wonderful days where you could customize your machine.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.960]   Oh, these are the opposite of the four, three pixels.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.720]   These are 16, nine screens.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.080]   They're wide screens.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.240]   That's interesting.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.080]   The other Chromebooks aren't wide like that, right?
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   I don't think so.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   No, this looks...
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.880]   Ooh, Samsung just loves that stitched faux leather.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.880]   Oof.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   Yeah, I don't get that.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880]   I think some of them may be.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.760]   I mean, the thing is that screens that shape are cheaper because they use TV.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760]   So...
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   Ah, is that wide?
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   Ah, that makes sense.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760]   So they make more of them.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   That makes sense.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.760]   I like the wide screen.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.760]   I don't mind the wide screen, but...
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   Jeff, what's that?
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   I like it on the tablet.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.360]   I don't like it on the laptop because it's the wrong shape for text.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.200]   But you could have side by side documents, couldn't you?
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.240]   Jeff, what's the slowdown on the Chromebook?
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.600]   Where do you feel like you need more RAM?
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.960]   Two gigs versus four gigs.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.880]   At least with the original Samsung, it would just hang up with too many tabs.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880]   As soon as you had more than...
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.880]   That's the big tabs.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   Number of jobs.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   Two tabs.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.080]   The four gigs made all the difference in the world and four gigs works.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.120]   And I don't know why to keep on putting out two gig Chromebooks.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   Well, my son...
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.600]   Two gig of RAM to run a browser.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.680]   Your son has pinched your pixel?
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   So he was...
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.400]   He was the only old Chromebook.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.200]   And then he borrowed the pixel one day and it hasn't come back.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.560]   You're a nicer dad than I am.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.080]   Yeah, better not pinch my pixel.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.920]   Well, I got the Pro's here.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   Oh, all right.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   I was like, okay.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.080]   But what I think what's telling is that your son wanted it.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.120]   Well, he had... well, originally he got a Windows machine because he wanted to...
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.160]   He had a particular thing he needed for speech and debate and he wanted a game on it.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.560]   And then when he broke that, I gave him the Chromebook.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.880]   I say, okay, well, hang on.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.880]   You can use this.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.240]   And he actually liked it.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.600]   And he said the advantage is that he's not tempted to go off and do other things as much
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.160]   as he was on the Mac.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.800]   So he tried to use the school thing.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   Very wise child.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.360]   That is wise, yeah.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   Is this the one that's going to Cambridge or the younger one?
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.680]   He's the younger one then.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.920]   My older son is not at Cambridge.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.320]   He's at King's College London.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   And Christopher's got various offers that we're still waiting to hit to here.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.880]   So we're in that tense period where different universities send us things and we're like,
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.080]   "Hm, it's exciting."
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   Wow.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   King's College is not...
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:15.600]   King's College London doing English and theatre and film and stuff.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.120]   And Christopher is applying for economics at various places.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.120]   Nice.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.120]   Oh my.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120]   Nice.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:27.160]   I think it's very important to start planning for the old age home.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.280]   And who's going to pay for it?
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.400]   So this is always timely.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:37.160]   Samsung has released a couple of YouTube videos on the Galaxy Gear and Gear Fit as well as
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.760]   the Galaxy S5.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.120]   Here's a question for you.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.800]   Will the Gear work with non-Samsung phones?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   No.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.040]   However, a wider range of Samsung phones than the old, the original Gear.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.600]   Oh, right though.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   I don't...
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.880]   I mean, I get up for the first generation just because they had to control it enough.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.640]   But when you have supposedly Google and Apple coming out with them to limit it that much,
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.200]   I don't understand from a business perspective.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.880]   I can promise you the Apple will only work with iPhones.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.080]   Well, yeah, but that's its own little world.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.640]   And the only one that's completely cross-platform right now is the Pebble.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.440]   So that, you know, advantage Pebble on that.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.040]   And they also have the best battery life.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.680]   But it doesn't do as much as the Gear Fit is gorgeous.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   Huh?
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.600]   Do you think the Google will work with an iPhone?
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   That's an interesting question.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.240]   That's a very good question.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.600]   I think if you're Google, it should, right?
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:35.160]   And you know, I'm not social, I'm not so sure on the Apple either because, you know,
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.400]   iPods work with anything.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.960]   No, no, Apple, no.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   I promise you.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   Apple.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:48.720]   But I could argue that Apple's feeling a little closed in and needs to get back into
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   the lives and bodies of other people now.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   They'd be chattering down below if Apple ever makes anything that works with Android.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   That seems highly chattering down below.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   What does that mean?
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   Because it's frozen in hell.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.400]   It's just a very long way of saying, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.160]   I thought that was a little obscure.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   I agree.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.280]   I was getting talking private parts, later down below.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.720]   That's what happens after your pinch.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   She'll get fixed.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.080]   I mean, your pixel gets pinched.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.880]   We have the changelogs still to come.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.920]   Now the gene is back.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.800]   We didn't do a changelog last week.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.520]   We just said screw it.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520]   It's hallowed ground.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   We can't do it.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   It's hallowed ground.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.320]   Yeah, it's unflattered.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.240]   Google's getting into the real estate market.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.720]   And Bing books.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.520]   Get ready for the Bing book.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.240]   Plus, I don't-- this just broke this--
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   Bingles.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.560]   You'll be bingles.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.360]   The guy who created the Scrugled campaign
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.760]   is now-- director is now in charge of--
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.760]   Strategy.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.280]   Strategy at Microsoft, Mark Penn.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   So it's been-- he collects the strategy tax.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.840]   He's the strategy tax inspector.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.040]   Wow.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.480]   He also came up with one of the worst--
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.360]   we were talking about this on Windows Weekly.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.720]   One of the worst current television campaigns,
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.680]   the Microsoft Honestly campaign in which you go to
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.160]   Microsoft.com/honestly.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.640]   You can see these ads there airing everywhere now.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.760]   In which people say, no, honestly, Windows isn't that bad.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.440]   Honestly, honest.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.360]   Oh, my God.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.240]   Oh, painful to watch.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.280]   It's sad.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.240]   The entire premise of our ad is either that someone else is,
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.480]   you know, worse or we're not that bad.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.360]   Where'd your respect go, Microsoft?
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.120]   But this is a Mark Penn--
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.880]   Mark Penn created-- you've seen the one with a teacher who
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.720]   says, I don't like computers.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.200]   Here, I'll just play a little bit of it.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.960]   Oh, you can't hear him.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.080]   A little old-fashioned.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.800]   I love chalk and erasers, but change is coming.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.240]   I don't like computers.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.120]   This was so awful.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   It was so awful.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:54.840]   I like computers.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.160]   I don't really like computers, but I guess if I have to use
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.880]   them, I'll use these strange tablets from Microsoft
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.160]   because that's what we got.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.400]   The audio computer.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.520]   Anyway, that's the whole bunch of these.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.240]   Honestly, I couldn't--
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.560]   how's this for a stunning recommendation?
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.120]   I couldn't find a reason not to buy it.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.720]   That's a triple negative now.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.280]   I needed a laptop and a tablet.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.440]   And I was confused.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.560]   So I don't love change.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.480]   I couldn't find a reason not to buy it, honestly.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.880]   So anyway, this guy's now in charge of--
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.240]   It's like dinosaurs, isn't it?
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.480]   It's very strange.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.520]   But one thing Mark Penn--
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.560]   this is what Paul Thorett pointed out, and I think it's true.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.760]   Maybe Mary Joffoli.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.000]   Mark Penn was known for when he was a pollster for the Hillary
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.080]   Clinton campaign was data.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.560]   And he's very data-driven.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.920]   And so my presumption is that both the Scrugald campaign
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.600]   and the Honestly Campaign come from research on what people
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.440]   are thinking about windows and so forth and responding
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.840]   directly to that research.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.280]   I would guess.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.280]   Someone else said one of the features, one of the features
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.080]   someone else said that he picks his data selectively
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.320]   to make himself look good.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.840]   In the Hillary world--
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.480]   I'm a Hillary voter.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.160]   He was controversial, too, because the 3 AM campaign,
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.680]   he didn't humanize Hillary enough.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.200]   There were other--
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:17.960]   He was fired.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.480]   He was fired.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.400]   He was fired halfway through the primary campaign.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.800]   For a reason.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.560]   Well, he's found a home.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.640]   We're going to take a break.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.000]   Come back with more, as I mentioned.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.800]   We've got a great panel here.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.480]   The lovely in town with the Kevin Marks in his garden.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.880]   His microphone is under a blanket.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.640]   We're at Safe and Warm.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.000]   Gina Tarpani and her mother's basement.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Aww.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.600]   There, Jeff Jarvis in the capital of the free world,
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.800]   Brussels, Belgium.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:51.440]   They do say that Brussels is not exactly an exciting town.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.560]   Is that the missing--
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.240]   I walk forever to find a restaurant tonight.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.800]   I got a very good restaurant.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.120]   But, oh, geez.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.440]   Took forever.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.960]   But you are in the land of beer and chocolate.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.640]   I mean, how could you go wrong there?
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.120]   I know.
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.620]   I know.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.240]   I had a really good steak tartar.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.760]   I went to this place that had different tartaras.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.600]   And the one I had was loaded with anchovies.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.560]   And the anchovies were not salty.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.360]   They were sweet.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.480]   They were fresh anchovies.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.080]   Oh, geez.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.360]   That's actually quite good.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.240]   Yeah, that was very good.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.720]   Oh, I also will admit that I now have my thumbs.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.360]   Well, you eat raw meat and anchovies in a ball.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.520]   You probably need some thumbs a little later on.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.640]   And then a tuna--
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:42.040]   I mean, a shrimp croquette and a cheese croquette.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.840]   And--
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.080]   And everything was wrong?
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.280]   No, no croquettes weren't.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.440]   Oh, OK.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.400]   There was so clever with the salad.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.640]   They did long strips of cucumber.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.280]   And that was the bowl for the salad.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.520]   Wow.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.560]   Do they break?
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.800]   They weave them like a basket?
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.240]   No, no, no.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.520]   Just put it around.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.760]   And then put the salad inside.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.160]   And then my freets were in a little fry basket looking thing.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.640]   And then the tartar and my nice demi of wine.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.040]   And I was very happy.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.120]   Mm.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:13.720]   Man, I haven't had--
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.240]   I know you.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   I'm going to wrap this up.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.240]   Actually, googling steak tartar now, because I want to see--
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.520]   You need a nature box snack.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.360]   We're going to get that to you.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.040]   New sponsored as salty snacks.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:30.640]   This is my--
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.720]   Not for the show yet.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.920]   This is my dream.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:39.600]   My dream was someday that we'd be sponsored by pizza, snacks,
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.440]   sugary drinks.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.680]   I've already bought two box.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.760]   It's the easiest thing to sell in the world.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.360]   But that's not what I'm talking about today.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.000]   I'm talking about legalzoom.com.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.040]   This should be easy to sell.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.440]   You know, March is National Start Your Own Business Month.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.880]   And I think a lot of people look at what's going on.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.600]   They look at what's app.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.000]   And they say, yeah, I'd like $16 billion, please.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.200]   I'd like to start my own business.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.080]   The truth is, it's very satisfying.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.280]   There's so many of us who found it frustrating to work
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.920]   for somebody else that I'm as smart as that person.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.600]   I could do this.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.640]   Start your own business.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.320]   Do it right now.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.640]   But make sure you protect your business.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.080]   Incorporate or do an LLC.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.360]   Make sure you trademark your trademark.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.920]   And legalzoom makes this all affordable.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.360]   You don't need a white shoe law firm to do this.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.520]   $99 to do an LLC.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.440]   Incorporate chapter S or chapter C, $99, plus the state
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.600]   filing fees.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.000]   You could do a trademark for $169, plus the federal filing
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.280]   filing fees.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.880]   That's also for your family.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.400]   Last will and testament.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.200]   They even have, if you look under the wills and trusts,
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.760]   a pet protection agreement, should you pass away?
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.440]   Hey, who's going to take care of Aussie?
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.600]   Have we ever thought of that?
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.760]   This is actually very important.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.760]   Health care power of attorney, a living will.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.240]   All of this stuff you can do at legalzoom for a lot less
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.440]   than it would cost to hire a law firm.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.560]   Legalzoom's not a law firm, but they will help you
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.440]   by connecting you with the right attorney.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.640]   These are self-help services.

[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.480]   Legalzoom provides self-help services.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.080]   They're not a law firm, but they can't connect you
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.400]   with the right attorney.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.720]   Don't put off the things you need to do.

[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.880]   Legalzoom.com.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:38.560]   This is the time to start your own.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.080]   Let's do that.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.360]   Why don't we do that thing we do with the trumpets
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.400]   and the drums and then Gina says stuff?
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.280]   What do we call that?
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.160]   The Google change law.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.080]   That's it.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.640]   Oh, what a throw.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   What?
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.320]   I mean, oh, broadcast masters at work.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.680]   Oh, Chad and I were on a wavelength.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.880]   And now from her mother's basement, Gina Trappelli.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.280]   Oh, God.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.280]   I'm just going to own it.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   Own it, baby.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.800]   Mother's--
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.320]   I'm owning it.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   It's awesome.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.840]   Gina, Gina, you can now charge for tours of the basement.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.960]   It's a new revenue stream.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.320]   I'm telling you.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.960]   So what did the chat said that maybe I should start a kick
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.600]   starter to re-panel my mom's basement?
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.120]   I think it's like the Berlin Wall.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.000]   You can sell pieces of the panel to TWIG fans.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.320]   Oh, my--
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.520]   That's brilliant.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.000]   It would be like the brick house, exactly.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.520]   So I wasn't here last week, but we still got a bunch of things
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.040]   going on.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.320]   I'm not going to get two weeks in here,
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.920]   but I will get the last week of changes in.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.520]   First, we got hands-free Google Voice search
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.880]   in the new Chrome beta.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.160]   So you can search by voice on Google now.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.240]   No extension required.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.200]   This is on your desktop.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   So it used to be-- you had to install a special extension
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.760]   and enable it no more in the Chrome beta.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.920]   You can open a new tab or visit google.com in Chrome.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.080]   You just say, OK, Google, and then start speaking your search.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.640]   This will be rolled out to English US only users
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.400]   on Windows, Mac, and Linux over the next few days,
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.320]   which should be happening now, with support
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.000]   for additional languages in Chrome OS coming soon.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.760]   OK, and get ready for all the people saying,
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.200]   you mean Chrome is always listening to me, always?
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.880]   Constantly?
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.680]   Well, yes, right?
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.880]   It has to.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.600]   Right, it has to be listening locally to hear the OK Google
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.800]   trigger word, right?
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.520]   That's the key locally, right?
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.720]   Locally, but it's not transmitting everything
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.680]   that you say to the cloud.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.080]   At least not that Google knows, right?
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.760]   The NSA, I can't speak for, but--
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.400]   So what do I say?
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.640]   OK, Google.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.440]   OK, Google.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.160]   Now, this is on Chrome beta, Chrome beta.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.680]   Yeah, be running the beta for us.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.720]   I have it yet, I guess.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.120]   I still want some more Easter eggs.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.800]   I want a new one.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.520]   Well, isn't OK Jarvis one?
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.240]   OK, Jarvis.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.200]   Was.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.920]   See, I don't have it.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.880]   I am on beta.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.760]   I'm up to date.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.040]   Just maybe just hasn't pushed yet.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.520]   Yeah, maybe, but hasn't gotten pushed yet.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.440]   You know, I got to say, I've been cooking here at my mom's house
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.360]   and like, I don't know where any of her stuff is.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.480]   I don't know where her timers are, her measuring cups.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.720]   I've been using Google Search, the voice search,
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.280]   to set timers and to say, you know, how many ounces in a cup
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.360]   and get those such results.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.240]   My wife laughs at me because I'm like, shh.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.400]   I got to do search.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.840]   Search for mom's measuring cups.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.000]   Search for mom's measuring cups.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Please, no, don't you have to--
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   No, that's why I need the Google bot to tell me where my mom's
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.200]   dash is.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.800]   Where are the measuring cups?
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.560]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.960]   They'll soon be a house search.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.160]   I am letting Google.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.760]   I am letting Google into my house take
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.360]   and take pictures of everything if they would just do that.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.560]   Where is that serving dish?
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.720]   You know the one--
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.840]   Oh, if I'd eat sex, everything's getting bad.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.680]   The 3D?
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.960]   Yeah, no, no, it's true.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.880]   It's true.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.120]   Google, where are my keys?
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.400]   Where are my keys, exactly?
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.120]   Where is the writer?
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.200]   Leo, don't you have to turn on the voice search?
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.120]   I don't think it just happens.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.960]   I think you have to turn it on.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.280]   Do I, Gina?
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.520]   I don't believe so.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.720]   I'm not actually not running the video.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.480]   I can't imagine they would just put that on
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.160]   by default.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.040]   It would freak people.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.560]   Oh, yeah, no, you're right.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:09.960]   You're right.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.160]   So I'm looking at the screenshot on the Google Chrome blog.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.480]   And so when you first get this and you go to google.com,
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.960]   there's a little pop-up that says, hey, say, OK, Google
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.800]   to start a voice search, and there's a button that says
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.560]   enable, enable OK Google.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.840]   So you'd have to click the button, enable OK Google.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.440]   So yeah, you're actually--
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.840]   So I am enabled.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.320]   Oh, it says, sorry, this experiment is not
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.520]   available on your platform.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.680]   Oh, that's the app launcher.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   No, that's Chrome for Chrome.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.200]   Let me search.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.800]   I'm just searching for voice.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   That's the only one I have.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.520]   And I think the little microphone kind of fills in.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.720]   It's hollow when it's not enabled,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.880]   and it fills in what it is.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.600]   OK, chatroom.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.400]   Find us the link.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:52.520]   I know it's Chrome colon slash slash flags.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.440]   And then there's like a hashtag that would give me directly
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:55.960]   to it.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.320]   Let's find that so we can enable it.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.200]   I don't see it here.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.480]   And I'm on the beta channel on the latest today.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.040]   Version 34.0.1847.45, baby.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.720]   Yeah, this is February 27.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.200]   And they said the next few days so that you should have it.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.280]   So when you go to Google.com, do you
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.080]   see the microphone in the search box?
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.200]   And it's filled in, or it's hollow.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.480]   It's hollow.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.240]   OK, OK.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.560]   It's like that, right?
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.480]   If I click on it, it works.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.840]   Yeah, if you click on it, it works, right?
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.280]   Where is Gina's mom's measuring cups?
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.960]   That came hard, apparently.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   Go back to Google.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   Go back to Google.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.720]   I'm going to say this is where my keys go.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.120]   Yeah, it gets an unexpected result.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.600]   Don't search for where are my keys?
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   Oh, well, wait, let me close that quick.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.480]   All right.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   I'll do that later.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.480]   Moving on.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.600]   Google redesign Hangouts for iOS.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.280]   This is the first update to the Hangouts app for iOS
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.320]   since they released it in November.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.920]   This adds video messages and animated stickers
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.520]   and just basically redesigns the app for iOS.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.280]   New loading screen and menus, cleaner look,
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.640]   different typography, the kind of flat iOS 7 design.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.560]   You can now attach a map to your current location,
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.400]   your conversation, which is something that has been
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.240]   available on Android for a while.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.920]   You can also record and send video messages up to 10 seconds
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.800]   long in Hangouts for iOS.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.720]   So that's definitely a welcome update for iOS users.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.240]   We were using Hangouts at work, and my coworker
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.960]   said that the experience on iOS just was not good at all.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.960]   So it's good.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.360]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.920]   It's easier.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:48.640]   It still mixes Hangout and text in a way that just--
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.840]   the UI just doesn't work for me.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.400]   We just won't mess it up.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.560]   I don't feel like Hangouts has been the universal messaging
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.520]   platform of our dreams.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.200]   I'm hoping that it's going to get there, right?
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.400]   But it's not quite.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.360]   I'm still running Google Voice and Hangout separately.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.200]   And yeah, the way it intermingles text messages.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:10.840]   But hopefully--
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.280]   I have a big problem of-- I'm getting
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.080]   spammed by attractive girls.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.800]   And I put that in the air quotes because I know that they're
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.080]   probably-- in fact, I know they're not.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.200]   Yeah, they're bots.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.840]   And they say, hi.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   And you can't turn that off.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.960]   You can't say, don't--
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.440]   I've gotten that.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.000]   I can't believe I should've said that.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.080]   Yes.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.040]   I get on my phone all the time.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.960]   No, I don't think it's--
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.880]   I think it's bots.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.320]   And I don't use it as SMS.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.800]   But if I go to Hangouts and look at invites or highs--
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.200]   because you can't block those.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.240]   You can't say, only let people on my list.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.160]   See, Martine sent me a message.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.120]   She's a very fetching young lady.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.160]   Jessica de la Torre has invited me to a Hangout.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.640]   Linda Lopez sent me a message.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.800]   Why don't you just say yes to what I'm right now?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.480]   Let's see what happens.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.960]   Really?
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.040]   All right.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:05.920]   Let's see your message.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.960]   She says, Bonjour, moi, sémentin, gére, sélche,
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.800]   onom-- I'm looking for a serious man.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.480]   That says Martine.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.120]   How long have you found one?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.080]   You found--
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.400]   I say, yeah.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.040]   Evie, really?
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:18.520]   Evie.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:18.840]   All right.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.760]   Lisa, you're watching.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.440]   I'm doing this on the show.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.240]   It's for research purposes only.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.280]   Jeff, you have to be.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.600]   Ma.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.440]   Petite.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.000]   Yeah, baby.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.160]   Be-- be-- why?
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.520]   OK.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.280]   Let's see if she responds.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.440]   If it's a bias, you respond right away, right?
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:45.400]   Moisie, Martine, gére, sélche, onom, sélche, nothing.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.680]   She looks offline.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.760]   Does that look like her icons?
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.960]   Oh, she's offline.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.560]   Yeah, it looks like--
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.240]   Well, how dare she be offline?
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.480]   What do you think she really wants?
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.920]   I know it isn't me.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.720]   Now it's going to get worse, right?
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.560]   Because I've responded to one of these.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560]   So they're in the settings.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.800]   You're welcome.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.600]   What's the setting?
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.840]   I don't see it.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.560]   OK, so go to Settings.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.400]   Click on--
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.480]   My account.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.680]   Scroll down a bit.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.560]   It says, customize invites.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.480]   How others get in touch with you?
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.160]   Hear your choices.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.240]   Everyone else, I can either have hang out with me
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.000]   or invite only.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.440]   So I'm getting invites.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.040]   There's no way to say, I don't want invites
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.760]   for somebody who's not in my circles.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   [SQUEAKING]
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.680]   See what I'm saying?
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.880]   See what I'm saying.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.440]   Oh, I thought I invited-- oh, I thought I invited--
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.520]   only you could invite them.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.760]   No, they can invite you, my friend.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.080]   And they do.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.200]   That was interesting.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.040]   So I've gotten a ton of invites, but I haven't gotten
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.280]   any of the notifications for them.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.480]   And I definitely shot this.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.160]   Well, I did turn off notifications,
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.240]   because I was getting a lot of them.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.960]   But now-- but that doesn't mean you still don't get invites,
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.480]   and they don't show up in other spots.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.520]   And they certainly show up in your hangouts.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.240]   And I have to explain to my girlfriend
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.280]   that I don't really know Linda Lopez.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.120]   And I don't know why she's wearing her underwear,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.080]   or why she messaged me the words "L-U."
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.680]   Seriously, Lisa, I never met that woman.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.640]   I don't know.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.840]   Should I add her too?
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.360]   No, no, no, don't make me look.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.560]   No, no, no.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.040]   No.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.360]   Your research is done, Fred.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.280]   OK, thank you.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.880]   Keep her all savvy.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.400]   So that, I just want to point out, that's a really annoying--
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.880]   That's not that annoying.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:29.880]   That is annoying.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.080]   And if I didn't have an understanding girlfriend--
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.680]   well, I do have an ex-wife, so there may be that explains it.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.360]   This could be embarrassing to people, right?
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.720]   If somebody didn't understand, why are you
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.840]   getting all these invitations from attractive young women?
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.560]   Right?
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.480]   I would have a problem.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.200]   So stop at Google.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.000]   I don't know them.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.240]   Google Plus for Android updated with new photography
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.240]   enhancements.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:58.740]   Yay.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.240]   Nice.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.560]   Yeah, that gives you the ability to start editing a photo
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.840]   on one Android device and continue the process
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   on another Android device, a nice cross-device editing.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.920]   A couple of new filters and editing tools.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.480]   You've seen them before from Snap Seed.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.600]   A couple of interface tweaks, such as a new ViewAll option,
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.160]   which displays your entire photo library, local photos,
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.960]   and cloud photos, and one central interface.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.640]   And there's a new option to quickly view photos by date.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.440]   There's a slider.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.600]   And you can view photos right there.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.440]   That's a biggie.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.520]   I have so many there.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.480]   I've tried to go back.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.280]   And it just is a pain.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.720]   That's a big one.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.080]   In fact, we were talking about this last night on all by Android.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.440]   I literally started going through my photos
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.400]   and lost track of the show.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.440]   I was like, oh, look, the baby was so little a year ago.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.000]   It's still a clock for the dude.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.760]   It's 3 a.m.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.040]   Did I miss the show?
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.520]   Very easy to do.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.960]   And last thing, the Google Now Launcher, which shipped on the Nexus
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.080]   5, is now in the Play Store.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.800]   And it's available to all the Nexus and Google Play
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.360]   Edition devices.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.960]   So the Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10, and Google Play Edition
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.640]   device owners like me, my HTC One Google Play Edition.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.440]   You can go to the Play Store.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.480]   You can download the Google Now Launcher.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.320]   It is exactly the APK that you may have
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.720]   sideloaded, which is kind of available everywhere.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.280]   It gives you Google Now if you swipe to the right.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.560]   It gives you wallpapers and a couple of different ways
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.960]   to kind of organize your widgets.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.000]   It's really nice launcher.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.960]   In fact, it's my default launcher now, because I like it so much.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.120]   It gives you some transparency in the status bar.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.400]   Really nice.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.640]   So it's pretty limited still, just Nexus and Google Play
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.600]   Edition devices.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.680]   But really, a nice option.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.960]   If you've got one of those devices,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.000]   you don't have to feel left behind by the Nexus 5.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.640]   That's all I've got.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.480]   Boom.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.320]   I don't know, Chad.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.680]   You were a little scared of me.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   I'm picking up one.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.800]   I bet you went Howard Stern does that.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.080]   It happens right away.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.560]   One more thing, if you have a Moto X,
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.720]   there's another spotlight.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.480]   Just came out.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.160]   Remember the hat that was blowing around now?
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:02.720]   There's a--
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.640]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.800]   You have to have a Moto X.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.160]   You know what?
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:06.720]   Don't show it.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.080]   Well, you can show it, because I don't think it's--
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.920]   if you don't jump on it, there'll
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.400]   be a little spotlight floating around.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.240]   If you don't jump on it, I don't see it now.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.280]   So--
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.720]   Did this auto download or--
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.760]   Yeah, it auto downloads.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.560]   I think it's an update.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.480]   You get an update to Motorola Spotlight, which is not an app.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.120]   So I don't know how exactly to launch it.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.320]   But this one, you have a flashlight.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.960]   So the way these work is they're sensitive to the accelerometer
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.960]   in the phone, and as you move the phone around,
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.400]   it advances the story.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.320]   It's got music and stuff.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.720]   It's really-- they're really cute.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.760]   I really like them.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.880]   But I don't have that--
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.520]   I don't know how to launch it now.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.800]   It's frustrating.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.720]   I know it's in there.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.200]   It starts whenever you don't want it to happen.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.680]   Yeah, the hat would just float in and out all the time.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.440]   Maybe I'd disable it.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.720]   But no, I saw the little bug, and then I didn't click it
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:00.720]   in time and then it went away.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.160]   So I guess they're sensitive to it all.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.480]   I guess we could go to YouTube and watch it.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.000]   But it's not quite the same as getting to play with it
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.960]   as you've aimed the flashlight.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.520]   Here is from Ian Heath via Mike Elgin, a Lego version
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.000]   of Ellen's selfie.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.440]   Wow.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.480]   That's special.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.560]   Take it out of life of its own.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.480]   What?
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.840]   What?
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.800]   OK, I just installed this one thing,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.200]   and it messed up my layout.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.520]   And it's given me one fewer row of icons.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.160]   The Google Now launcher?
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.520]   Yeah, it's put on the Nexus 7.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.720]   It's like a dead row of icons that I can't put things
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.880]   into anymore.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.320]   Oh, yeah, the Nexus 7 does not have a bottom row.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.440]   No, it does have a bottom row, but it's--
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.440]   but they were laid out in a particular way,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.560]   and they've all been scrambled.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.280]   Well, yeah, because you put a different launcher.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.920]   Go back to your old launcher.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.800]   Right?
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   Or does it replace your launcher?
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.320]   It's replaced my launcher.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.560]   Oh, no, you can choose.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.440]   I mean, you can--
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.320]   No, it said import the icons.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.120]   Oh, it did do it.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.040]   Import where they were.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.640]   Are you coming from the old Google launcher?
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.200]   Yeah, it just poured them in at the top.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.080]   So that my spatial memories will come bad.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.360]   Oh, I hate it when that happens.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.000]   I led you astray.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.800]   What's it called?
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.720]   Is it just called Google launcher?
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.320]   Yeah, I just picked the--
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.840]   You can't launcher?
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:22.960]   But they don't see it on here.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.760]   Maybe I can't put it on a Moto X.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.840]   I thought that was the point, though.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.080]   You could put it on anything now.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.640]   Yeah, it's Nexus and Google Play.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.440]   Oh, you can be Nexus.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:29.960]   OK.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:30.760]   Nevermind.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.320]   Google Now launcher.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.920]   Google Now launcher, yeah.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.440]   You'll get a choice, look.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.480]   Google Now?
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.240]   You do have a choice.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:37.760]   Yes.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.720]   That's what I thought.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.680]   So you can go back to your old--
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.840]   what's the opposite of now?
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.440]   Google then.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.400]   You Google then launcher.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.200]   Google then.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:48.480]   There we go.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   Launcher.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   Just plain launcher.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.680]   Launcher.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.320]   I haven't looked at launcher in forever.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.360]   I'm going to switch back to launcher.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.280]   You can tell this test up up, actually, because it is a bit of a mess.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.200]   I use it.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.720]   I use it.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.400]   But it did.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.600]   It took a row of my things off and put it on the next screen,
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.240]   which is kind of really bad.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:03.680]   And I've got to do it.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.520]   Yeah, it's totally different, huh?
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.400]   And I've got a bunch of nice widgets on my other screens,
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.320]   which is eight.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.840]   So this is definitely a step backwards.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.320]   And thanks to Kevin Marks for sitting along David Cameron's
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:13.680]   tweet.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.080]   Can you say it in a posh, poncy British accent,
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.440]   as David Cameron might say it?
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.960]   He says, I've been speaking to Barack Obama on the telephone.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.600]   And then there's a picture of him very seriously.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.400]   Can you get this on the telephone?
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.520]   I don't think he's really talking to Barack Obama in that shot.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.280]   This is really posed for--
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:37.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.400]   It's so bad.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.520]   It's very old telephones.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.600]   I've been speaking to Barack Obama about the situation
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.440]   in Ukraine.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.560]   Hello, Barack.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.240]   It's David.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:51.040]   And the people are now making fun of this.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.680]   Oh, this is going to be a meme.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.640]   People holding phones.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.920]   You know, I think we should submit it to Shutterstock.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.200]   It could be a great stock photo.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.960]   And speaking to Ellen on the phone about the situation
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   with them.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.400]   Quick, somebody tweet that.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.200]   Oh.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.040]   Oh, world.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.800]   I'm just speaking on the phone of Verizon
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:16.920]   about the situation with the next person.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.760]   Yes.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.640]   Oh, it's a meme.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.040]   Let's quick start the tumbler.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.520]   I've been speaking on the phone.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.760]   It's better than buying us full of women.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.600]   I was speaking to Hitler about the Hitler video.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.400]   The era phone.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.720]   A-R-A. Is that how you pronounce it?
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.160]   This is the phone, the kind of--
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:38.800]   Ara.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.440]   Ara?
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:39.960]   You say Ara?
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.480]   Get a modular phone.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.120]   We've been saying Ara on all about Android.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.920]   Well, you get to decide.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.400]   It's a modular phone.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.000]   It's the part of Motorola mobility
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.120]   that didn't go off to Lenovo.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.600]   And for the first time, we've seen a demo of it.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.360]   This was at the launch event.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:00.520]   Jason Calicatus' launch event last week.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.360]   Paul Aramenko from Google demonstrated it.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.440]   And showed off prototypes, but non-functional.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.600]   So it's just like bricks.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.360]   I mean, they're just sort of like pieces that snap into--
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:11.880]   Legos.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.840]   --to a back, right?
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.920]   Yeah, they kind of look like Legos.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.120]   Yeah, but it seems like it sounds like consumer release
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.400]   early next year.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.240]   Wow.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.320]   And with a big focus on aesthetics and styles
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.320]   and making your phone look the way you want it.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.960]   So Moto Maker like--
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.920]   which surprised me.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.480]   I thought, yeah, we were talking about this last night
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.640]   and I was saying, I don't know what I was saying.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.160]   Yeah, this is the maker's phone.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.000]   But the way that the phone blocks put out a video
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.560]   and it sounds like they're targeting people who really
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.520]   want to customize even the look of their phone,
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.120]   as well as the functionality.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.200]   So what's your bet?
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.280]   Will these things ever be on Verizon?
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.320]   No.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   Come on, Jeff.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:50.840]   Get real.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.160]   Especially with Verizon, Moto, it'll be much bigger.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.120]   The point of it is very cheap, $50 to get started.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.120]   So I mean--
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.280]   But that really is Wi-Fi only.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.800]   Yeah, it's very basic, right?
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.480]   But then you could then-- but that gives you
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.360]   the endoskeleton, which you can then add more stuff.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.320]   It comes with a display low-end CPU, a Wi-Fi module,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:14.120]   small bits in battery, runs Android.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.560]   But then as your budget allows, you
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.200]   can add modules to it, which is, I think,
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   a really interesting idea.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.320]   The modules are hot swappable.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.120]   So you don't have to shut down it.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.400]   Wow.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.280]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.560]   And if you think about these devices
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.880]   as something more than phones, if you
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.440]   want to build your own baby monitor
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.760]   or you want to-- and with the video,
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.520]   somebody to attach one of the bottom of a skateboard
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.200]   to map their route.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.800]   Or if you think of them as a Wi-Fi connected device,
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.400]   it's modular.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.160]   And that could essentially get all sorts of different sensors.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.920]   You can use them for anything.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.800]   It's kind of like a more consumer-friendly, I guess,
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.520]   Arduino in a way.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.920]   That is very interesting.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.480]   So it's not just a phone.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.560]   It really is amazing.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.680]   So I see what Aaron's saying.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.760]   It's a maker thing.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.260]   Wow.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.260]   It also means you're not going to be throwing out-- people
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.180]   like us throwing out phones every nine months.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:01.920]   Yes.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.260]   But imagine that you're on the phone
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.660]   and it crumbles in your hands.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.860]   The parts fall.
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.420]   My phones fall like a part.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:07.900]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.660]   Let me put it back together.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.260]   I don't mean-- how much time do we
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.820]   spend with their phones like this anymore?
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:14.420]   We don't, right?
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.020]   We use them for other things.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:16.700]   We're tracking you.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.940]   I think it's best not to think of this as a phone,
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.660]   but to think of this as a device in the internet of things
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.660]   as a thing that's connected that you could do stuff.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.900]   I mean, I think this is really cool.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.820]   Yeah, running Android with lots of different apps.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.140]   I think this is lots of different things,
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.620]   depending on what sensors that you have.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:36.700]   It's kind of one of those--
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.420]   it's a little bit one of those catch-all.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.500]   It can do anything, but what would I use it for?
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.060]   Anything, but what?
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.060]   Anything.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.900]   Things will come out of the maker community for sure.
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.380]   I can put it on my mother's measuring cups
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:49.380]   and they will call me.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.700]   We have a technical wave problem.
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.580]   It's like it's everything and nothing.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.940]   No, I think so that we are in a mature enough environment
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:56:59.660]   in the maker world.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.420]   Thanks to Raspberry Pi and the match modules
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:05.180]   and all these other things that people understand
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:09.180]   that a connected device, configurable device,
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.940]   has all sorts of wonderful uses, and they will use these.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:17.580]   Is there a consumer market device like that yet?
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:18.420]   Is this the first one?
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:22.060]   Is this the first maker consumer device?
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:23.340]   Yeah, if it's pretty easy.
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.100]   I mean, let's say, OK, you're a kid--
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.540]   You never think it was a bit like that.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.940]   I think this sounds like it'd be easy enough.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:33.340]   What does that snap together thing for the kids?
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.140]   But imagine, OK, so I'm a kid at Dad and Father and Son.
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:39.140]   We want to make a balloon that'll do aerial photography.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.340]   Well, you just get one of these.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.980]   You put a camera module on it.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.060]   You put it in the thing and you go, there's all sorts--
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.140]   I mean, I think that that is--
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.340]   This is very intriguing. I love it.
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.380]   It's like we need a GPS.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.460]   We need an accelerometer and we need a camera.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.020]   Yeah, or we want a better camera or we want whatever.
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:56.460]   We want a different camera kind of camera.
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.220]   It's not much better about it.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.660]   It's somewhat specialized market, but not that, not so much so.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:07.180]   And boy, I was just at the maker magazine on Thursday,
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.500]   and we got the tour and stuff.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:13.260]   And what's interesting is how they tapped into something
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.860]   and it just grew like Topsy almost instantly.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:16.860]   The first thing--
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.180]   What's so exciting about this is that you now get an aftermarket
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.820]   for the guts of the phone.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.180]   Yes.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.820]   Right, that's what's amazing.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.020]   Now it becomes open source hardware.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.100]   It's weird.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.380]   It's what Chris Anderson has been arguing.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:29.380]   Other people are arguing.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.780]   His hardware is the next frontier.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:33.780]   I don't know if I buy that yet, but it's
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:34.860]   an exciting opportunity.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:39.300]   Well, but if the internet of things is really going to be a thing,
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.780]   then the Google has to have a position and a stake in it.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.620]   It's not going to be glass.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.820]   That's $1,500.
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.500]   It's not even going to be a Google watch.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:49.540]   Much better to have a generic vanilla thing
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.500]   that you can use to prototype ideas.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.260]   And maybe you're right.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.940]   Maybe Jeff become a market as well.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.060]   I love this idea.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.500]   This is exactly what Google should be doing to me.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:58:59.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.900]   I mean, the thing is you can already
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.540]   buy lots of bits and pieces that do certain things like this.
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.380]   You can buy little cameras that you can stick to the wall
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:10.100]   or you can buy extra screens and things like so on.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.700]   And the question is, can you make these sort of pluggable
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.660]   modules cheap enough to make it cheaper than buying
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:18.580]   when there's outright?
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:18.940]   Right.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.420]   50 is not yet yet.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.100]   But I think it's more than that, Kevin.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:27.740]   I think it also creates a framework for devices.
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.980]   And so now you go to the--
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.700]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.340]   Our store, as Gina would say, our store.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:38.460]   And you keep buying more of these modules until you have--
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.940]   people like us will have 20 modules and five spots for them.
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.260]   And we'll have wives and husbands, people you'll announce.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:45.980]   If you can get the price down, it'll help.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.220]   But $50 to start is how you seed the market.
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.420]   That makes sense.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.620]   The Raspberry Pi's $25 to $35.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.700]   And that's certainly selling very, very well.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.740]   It's Tinker Toy phone.
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.300]   Somebody-- nano, nano, sit there, chattro.
[00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:58.980]   Tinker Toys.
[00:59:58.980 --> 00:59:59.660]   Tinker Toys.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.140]   I like that.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.060]   I like that.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.020]   A retro set.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:07.140]   Heathkit.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.100]   No, it's actually-- no, it's easier than Heathkit.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:16.780]   Danny Sullivan calls it SEO's Oreo Moment, a tweet relating
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.780]   to search engine optimization that is getting as much attention
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.340]   as Oreo's Super Bowl blackout.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.100]   Do we remember that last year in the Super Bowl?
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.980]   The blights went out at the Super Dome.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.900]   And Oreo said you could still dunk in the dark.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.900]   And it was a huge success for social media marketing.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.460]   Yesterday, Matt Cuts announced a new Google scraper report
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.940]   for publishers to use if they see a site that is scraping
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.820]   their content right on.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.180]   It's a big problem.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.420]   Of course, immediately, people pointed out
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:53.180]   the kind of Google scraper like you mean like Google?
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.140]   I mean, it was the particular screenshot
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:55.980]   that was so good as well.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.700]   He said, I think I've spotted one, Matt.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.340]   Note the similarities in the context.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.820]   It was, I got to get points for a joke.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.780]   It was very well done.
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.460]   He's, of course, pointing out that the knowledge graph uses
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.060]   Wikipedia and scrapes it.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.420]   Although I would guess that Google has a deal with Wikipedia
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.340]   to do this, right?
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:15.860]   It doesn't matter.
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.300]   It doesn't matter because Wikipedia is--
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.500]   It's a bad example, right?
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.940]   Because Wikipedia is a content as well.
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.460]   It is, but it's funny.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.260]   It is funny.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:27.420]   It was very-- the screenshot was perfectly timed.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.620]   It was funny.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.900]   But when he gets down to it--
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.700]   It's not only a legitimate complaint.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.940]   There's a big difference too, because really,
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:38.100]   the scraper sites are doing is taking Jeff Jarvis's blog
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:42.020]   post and putting it on their site with ads around it
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:42.780]   as if they wrote it.
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.860]   And it happens a lot.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.700]   I mean, people are really--
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.140]   And Google was taking Wikipedia and put it on their site
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.900]   without surrounding it.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.900]   But what Wikipedia's license allows us to cut it.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.900]   But-- but--
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.980]   Well, no, I mean, what it does say
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:01.260]   is that it does highlight how hard it is to do this.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.020]   And to actually write a crawl of these days.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.860]   Yeah, what is--
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.420]   It's harder and harder because there are only sites
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.620]   like there isn't Google from calling them.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.780]   You know, we--
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.060]   as a technorizer, we wrote this.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.740]   We wrote the crawl of the crawl blogs
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.260]   and do stuff like that.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.740]   And we were creating tag pages and things like that
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.420]   that we're showing up in Google results.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.700]   There was always a slight tension back and forth about
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.780]   will they decide where a scraper site
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.500]   and throw them out of the results or are we adding value?
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.300]   So there's a bit of tension there.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.700]   The reason--
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.940]   But the challenge now is actually quite hard to write a crawl.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.980]   Because so many sites will actually block you directly
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.940]   or require login and some--
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.820]   And that's why we're moving towards social search
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.820]   and others better forms of search anyway.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:44.180]   Crawling is going to look as antiquated as Yahoo's human editors.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:44.820]   No, no.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.500]   That's the other way around.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.140]   I think the core needs to become back
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.140]   because people realize that they're missing it.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:49.860]   Really?
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.780]   The social isn't good enough.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:52.940]   Interesting.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.340]   Well, as the social stuff gets more and more polluted
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.220]   with its own weird rankings and its own ad priorities.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:02:59.720]   Right.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.420]   Maybe that's what we're doing, was we're just
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.340]   trying to stay ahead of the pollution.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:07.140]   Just trying to stay upstream, whatever possible.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.740]   The reason Danny Sullivan calls it an Oreo-level tweet
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:16.340]   is because, as of his writing, 14,000 retweets
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.260]   and 12,000 favorites for Dan Barker.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.500]   That's pretty good.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.500]   That's pretty good.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.460]   That was within 24 hours.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.780]   I wonder what it is now.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.460]   Oh, that's Apple calling me from Texas.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.060]   Well, I'll take it later.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.060]   That's a long story.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.220]   The Mac Pro.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.460]   Mac Pro saga.
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:35.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.220]   And so somebody's been calling me from Apple Austin, which
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.660]   is, I think, where the Mac Pros are made.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.700]   So I think they want to figure out
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.420]   why there's a footprint on my RAM.
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:52.300]   Google invests a million dollars in getting more
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.860]   female entrepreneurs.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.580]   It sounds like a lot of money, but I don't know.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.340]   Not much.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:57.860]   I don't know.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.140]   That's not really not much.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.300]   For Google.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.540]   It's a million-dollar grant to galvanize, which
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:08.220]   is a Denver co-working hub and a startup center.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.900]   They're giving million dollars to them and others
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.940]   to increase the number of female entrepreneurs by 25%.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.060]   Galvanize has a program to do that, I guess,
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.140]   to increase the involvement of women.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.260]   And there are others.
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.940]   But it's a million dollars not just to galvanize,
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.220]   but to 40 programs worldwide.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.500]   So it's kind of-- they're relatively small grants.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.420]   Maybe they're enough, though.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.660]   Sometimes they'll ever position exactly right,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.020]   can move a mountain.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.700]   And it makes a statement.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.500]   I would hope they would do more, even, right?
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.420]   Keep it up.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.540]   So Google, we also need more journalistic entrepreneurs.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.980]   I'm just talking, just saying.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.620]   And you know, Google, you could support internet television
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.340]   broadcasting.
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:55.540]   That's a useful thing, too.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.620]   A little grant here.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.380]   You're doing both things at CUNY.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.180]   We'll do the show.
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.220]   We'll do that, with our students.
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:02.660]   We do.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.380]   We talked with Sarah Barlet about that.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.140]   I've talked with Lisa.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.060]   We love that idea.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:07.900]   We're on.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.940]   All right.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.260]   All right.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.060]   Because CUNY wants to do more of the kind of stuff--
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:12.980]   In the context of CUNY.
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:13.420]   CUNY.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:13.860]   CUNY.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.220]   Not CUNY.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.180]   CUNY.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.940]   CUNY wants to do more of the stuff, the kind of stuff
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.580]   we're doing here in the Brick House.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.100]   We would like to have a little base of operations
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.500]   in New York, New York.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.380]   I hear that's a pretty big city.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.900]   And so maybe there's a little--
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.700]   CUNY G. possible.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.740]   And then we get--
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.580]   And Gina to do her third show.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.100]   Gina, get her out of the basement.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.420]   Get me out of the basement, Leo.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.100]   It's Gina out of her mother's basement.
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.500]   Yeah, Leo, get me out of the basement.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.620]   And ironically, she'll be in CUNY's basement,
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.740]   but that's OK.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.340]   Well, CUNY's my albabolauter.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:48.860]   So--
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   Oh.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.360]   Oh.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:50.860]   Oh.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   Congratulations.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.380]   My graduate at CUNY, a graduate school.
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.740]   What's that program called in the basement there, Jeff?
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.740]   What's the program called in the basement?
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.340]   Isn't there-- I think Sarah said there's a name for it.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.740]   Maybe not.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.940]   It's just some kids in the basement with a camera.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.940]   I don't know.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:05.940]   We're going to make up something.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.940]   Oh, there isn't something there already.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.100]   No, we're going to make something new.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.340]   Oh, this is something new.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.140]   Yeah, because--
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:12.940]   It inspired us.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.420]   When your dean, Sarah Bartlett, was here,
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.260]   she mentioned that they really liked
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.660]   to-- in the School of Journalism at CUNY,
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.100]   they really liked to get kids doing real world journalism.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.340]   And the other thing is--
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.740]   I actually almost said this on here.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.260]   Oh, wait.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:26.780]   I'll wait.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.980]   Save it.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:29.980]   Save it for offline conversation.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.460]   It inspired--
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.260]   Yes.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.060]   Just hush my phone.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:37.220]   Well, the Google barge has found a new home.
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.580]   This is funny for anybody who knows the Bay Area.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.180]   It's moving to Stockton.
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.220]   OK, why is this funny?
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.220]   I don't get it.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.500]   Why is this funny?
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.820]   Well, it's not exactly the headquarters of the world.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:54.620]   OK.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.220]   I don't-- I think it's inland.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.380]   Isn't it in the valley?
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.020]   There's no water in Stockton.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.740]   That would be a problem.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.340]   Well, I think it's--
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.380]   There's a lake.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.220]   There's--
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.740]   We can somebody verify this.
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.180]   I believe Stockton-- we call it in the valley, do we not?
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.820]   Which would imply that it's in a valley.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:18.620]   No, it says--
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:19.020]   It says the--
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.420]   There's a port of Stockton.
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.220]   Oh, there is a port.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:21.900]   OK.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.940]   The port of Stockton at the end of a river.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.340]   OK.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.420]   It's a new walking river.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.820]   It has two miles of dock space.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:32.420]   It's just outside the jurisdiction
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.420]   of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.540]   Commission.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.500]   Well, there you go.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.260]   That's the advantage.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:38.940]   There it is.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.660]   So they're going to take that barge,
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:44.860]   and they're going to go all the way up that river to Stockton.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.780]   So they've got to go all the way right, all the way
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.820]   around from our teenagers and the delta.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.540]   And if the drought were still on,
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.620]   I wonder whether they could do it.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.420]   I think that that's not really a river.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:58.580]   It's a tidal slew.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:03.180]   Bay ship and yacht is subleasing their peer to Google.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.300]   So there goes the barge.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.740]   Sometime in the next 24 hours, weather permitting.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:09.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.540]   Isaac, you need a live--
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:11.540]   you need live cover.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:12.580]   He's the barge gang.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.180]   I think you need a drone over it.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.540]   That's really kind of pathetic.
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:21.820]   I don't think there's going to be a huge wave of people
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:25.260]   heading to Stockton to see Google Class.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.660]   So you need to get a stand up at the empty pier.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:28.780]   I'm standing here in--
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:31.340]   I think they just left or that they are about to react.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   Leo LePorge from Treasure Island.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.140]   This water used to have the barge.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:36.940]   Not anymore.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:39.820]   Good, Gina.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.100]   Good.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.460]   I will do a stand up just for you.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.740]   You are a real TV, Gileo LePorge.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:44.100]   That's what you're--
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:44.420]   I know.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.100]   Why am I sitting in a studio?
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:46.900]   What's wrong with me?
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.380]   I'm unenvisionous.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.380]   I'm unenvisionous.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.380]   The helicopter is chasing the barn.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:50.460]   Nice thing with the internet is that you can time it
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:55.300]   so that the barge is going by you while you're talking.
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.300]   You control your own schedule.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.300]   Slowly.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   You know, actually--
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.300]   Slowly.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.300]   Slowly.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.980]   So the Just San Francisco Giants play an AT&T park.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:06.260]   It was relatively recently built, beautiful downtown
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.340]   ballpark in San Francisco.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.540]   I know you all know it.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.260]   And there's a giant Coke bottle, a beautiful, huge Coke bottle
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.820]   out in the left field.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.940]   And it's got slides in it and the kids can go down it.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:16.780]   The thing is massive.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:22.540]   It was made here in Petaluma and barged down the Petaluma River.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:27.940]   And I was, in fact, there for the barging of the Coke bottle to the ballpark.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.980]   Why did I do a stand up?
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.860]   That's live action television right there.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.180]   I just stood there and watched it, me and the kids.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.460]   So you can actually go go by canal all the way from
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:38.100]   from Petaluma too.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.340]   That's why Petaluma exists.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:45.940]   We are a finger of the bay that, you know, the gold and the lumber and the chicken and
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.940]   the eggs.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   The chickens.
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:48.940]   Go right in the chickens.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.880]   Is it still a chicken capital Leo?
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.380]   No, it's now ducks.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:53.380]   Really?
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.860]   Yeah, we still have the chicken and eggs, the butter and eggs day parade.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.860]   We still do that.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.860]   But, but in fact.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:02.420]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.420]   wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.380]   Have you ever dressed up as a chicken?
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.340]   No, Colin.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:14.420]   They have a contest called the cutest little chicken town in which parents and their children
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   dress as chickens.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:18.420]   I want pictures.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.420]   I want pictures.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.420]   There's many a moon.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.620]   Somebody search for that.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.820]   But so we were a actually in the 1900s, early 1900s.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:34.100]   This was a what was happening is Jews who were being persecuted in Russia by the pogroms
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:40.500]   by the czar were rescued by do-gooders in Northern California.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.940]   But all of these Jews were for the most part peasants.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.500]   They didn't have any skills.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.860]   And they were, what are we going to do with them?
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.740]   And they realized a very low capital business.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.060]   They could start them up and was chickens, chickens and eggs.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.400]   So there the whole country set around here is dotted with these hundred year old chicken
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.060]   coops giant chicken coops.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.660]   We had two on our old property giant chicken coops.
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:03.940]   But as you know, that kind of died out as a business.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:08.100]   We were for a while the number one producer of eggs in California.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.020]   But what has survived?
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.020]   Why am I telling you this?
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:12.020]   What is this?
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.180]   A tour, a travel log.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:18.140]   We have survived as the home of fine high quality ducks.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:23.220]   There's a restaurant you could go to you New Yorkers called Petaluma in Manhattan that
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.620]   serves Petaluma duck.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.220]   And every duck you get in Chinatown San Francisco comes from Petaluma.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.220]   Liberty farms up here.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.420]   Fabulous peaking duck.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.420]   Yep.
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:33.420]   Just saying.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.220]   That's good to know.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.700]   They always look so sad in the window of the Chinese restaurant.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.700]   Well, they're dead.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.700]   They're dead.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:44.340]   I don't know if they're sad or the nakas.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.340]   Sleeping.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:46.460]   It's sleeping.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:54.420]   Let's take a break and talk about something else.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.620]   When we come back, that's a dead duck.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.540]   Yahoo is turning off Google and Facebook.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:07.980]   We will talk a little bit about Google Maps as far as Apple is concerned with CarPlay.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:12.380]   Android's a big seller worldwide and a lot more.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.820]   Oh, and the CNN, a Zite story.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.820]   But first of all, yeah.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.820]   Sorry.
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:19.820]   Sorry.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.820]   I'm going to be on.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.220]   It's late.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:30.100]   Your yawn sounded like a yeah.

[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:25.260]   Those are going on sale today at Teespring.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:29.140]   We liked, I don't know how many designs we got, like 20 or 30.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:32.300]   We liked five of them so much that we bought five of them and we're going to make some
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.740]   other stuff, but this was the winning, we had a vote and this was the winning.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.740]   Keep voguing.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.700]   No, more voguing.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.700]   I want to see.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.700]   Are they voguing?
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.700]   Come on guys.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:42.700]   Let's do it.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.140]   Strike a pose.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:48.380]   And we have a women's sweatshirt too.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.540]   So not just a hoodie.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.540]   There you go.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.540]   Oh, look at that.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.540]   They're naturals.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.540]   Glenn in the chat.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.660]   When do you get the twit underwear?
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.500]   That could be next.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.940]   We always do, you know, we realize the way to do this.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:00.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.940]   I think Jeff is asking you to model it underwear.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:03.940]   I don't want to.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.100]   I am wearing Scottie vest underwear.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.100]   Should I show you that?
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.100]   I already did that.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.700]   Scottie vest underwear, huh?
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:13.300]   Yeah, they got little pockets in the boxers.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.300]   I'll see.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.380]   You can wire it up.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.940]   Get some heat sensors down there.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:27.860]   What was that joke Ellen made about the, it was very funny about, you know, the Wolf
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.860]   of Wall Street.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.820]   Oh, something that, a couple of really good ones.
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:33.820]   She was funny.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:34.820]   Yeah, she was good.
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:35.820]   She was good.
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:36.820]   I've seen it.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.020]   Yeah, I liked her.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.020]   There you go.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.580]   Stop showing that.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.380]   There I am in my Scottie vest boxer shorts.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:51.860]   It does not have meat sensors in it.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   Is that what you said?
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.780]   No, that's not what I said by the way.
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:59.180]   This is fine.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.940]   Mom, I'm trying to find your meat sensors.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.860]   There are, what drawer do you keep those in?
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:08.180]   Anyway, not back to the commercial.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.500]   So that's where we got the hoodies.

[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.620]   Love the designs we get.
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:10.620]   Are those hoodies on sale yet?
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:12.460]   Tspring.com/twig.
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.780]   That's T-double-e.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.940]   Spring.com/twig.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:22.660]   The campaign for the bobbleheads is thankfully over.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:28.500]   The bobblehead will be replaced by those hoodies later in the day.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:33.780]   We got the second batch.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:39.900]   There's actually 600 of these in the world today.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.740]   We hope to sell more hoodies, frankly.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:45.100]   This isn't, we don't make a lot of money out of this, but it's fun for us and it gives
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:52.460]   you guys a chance if you want to buy Twit memorabilia and merchandise.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.500]   No more guac at Chipotle.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.300]   What is that story?
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.220]   Could be it's a threat.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:05.860]   You're saying that thanks to man-made global warming, my burrito bowl is going to be free
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.860]   of guac?
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.380]   It's going to happen.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.380]   No.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:11.380]   Really?
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.380]   All right.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:17.300]   Chipotle in its annual report said, "In the event of cost increases with respect to one
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.860]   or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items such
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:31.460]   as guacamole or one or more of our salsas rather than paying the increased cost for ingredients."
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:36.940]   Meanwhile, they added tofu.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.420]   That's not going to do it.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:42.460]   They added the sofritas vegan tofu dish.
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.860]   Actually we have vegans here in the studio.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.700]   One of those two people posing for you is a vegan.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.380]   And so I'm sure he's very...
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.020]   What's that, a squeal from you?
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:58.020]   You get to guess which one.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:04.140]   Stop it.
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:11.980]   Chipotle uses 97,000 pounds of avocado a day.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:12.980]   Cheers.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.980]   Wow. 35.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.540]   There was an avocado glut.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:22.540]   Every doctor in California bought avocado ranches.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:23.540]   Remember that?
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.540]   See?
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:25.540]   It was the great tax dog.
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:26.540]   See?
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.540]   And doctors in Dennis.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.540]   Yep.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.900]   And so there was a glut of avocados.
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:30.900]   Did you know that...
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.620]   There could never be too many avocados.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.620]   I agree.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:42.580]   Although Chipotle's doing 34 million pounds of guacafacados a year, this story goes on
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:47.740]   to say that while the avocado industry is fine at the moment, scientists are expecting
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.780]   drier conditions which could have an impact on California's crop.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.780]   That would be sad.
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.780]   Chipotle's guacamole is serviceable.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.780]   It's solid.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.780]   No, it's not.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.780]   It's not the best, but it's not fake.
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:01.780]   No.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.780]   It's an accessory.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.780]   Yes.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:06.860]   It's so easy to make your own guacamole.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:11.020]   Everybody should go out, get a couple of very nice avocados.
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:15.380]   You want them to be a little soft to the touch, not hard, hard, hard, but not mushy, mushy,
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.380]   mushy.
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.500]   Look for hollow parts so you don't want anything.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.540]   And then you just cut them in half.
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:24.500]   You mash them up with a little salt, some pepper, some garlic, some onions, maybe a little
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.900]   salsa.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.900]   You can...
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.900]   Hot sauce.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.900]   Hot sauce.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:29.900]   A little hot sauce if you want.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:30.900]   And it's a fabulous dish.
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.900]   Easy to make and good for you.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.140]   Seven years in San Diego, that was my big takeaway.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.300]   Can you get avocados in New York City?
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:37.300]   Yes.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.300]   Yes.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.300]   Actually, fresh direct.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:42.300]   I've been using fresh direct a lot because it's just easier.
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.740]   They didn't deliver to me in San Diego.
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:44.740]   So it's kind of wonderful.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:45.740]   And like they're great.
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:46.740]   Like the avocados are great.
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.700]   Well, is that Amazon universe, Mr. Bani?
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.700]   What's that?
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.700]   No.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.180]   Is that Amazon fresh director?
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.180]   Is that something else?
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:58.580]   It's grocery shopping for New York City.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:03.140]   In more important, Chipotle news, perhaps, have you heard about the quesareto?
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.140]   What?
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:08.420]   The burrito wrapped in a cheese quesadilla.
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:13.860]   You know, there's a link right below the guacamole crisis link in the rundown.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:19.180]   It's a Chipotle burrito made with a quesadilla.
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.060]   You wrap your burrito in a cheesecake cedilla.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.060]   All the rage, apparently.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.980]   Sounds like something kind of epic meal time.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.980]   That was disgusting.
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:31.980]   That was not the reaction I was looking for.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.980]   Okay.
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:33.980]   So that picture.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:36.420]   Why not just wrap that in a piece of pizza?
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:38.580]   And then you can put deep fry it.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:42.340]   And then deep fry it and put quasadilla around it.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.340]   And call it a prorito.
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:49.340]   That's a puddle of a macaque and then inside a chicken and inside a turkey.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:51.540]   And then some burritos.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.540]   Turbuc burrito.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:53.540]   Turbuc burrito.
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:59.940]   I watched the poor person at the end of the line in Chipotle.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:06.140]   Because when there was people really stuff them trying to get the tortilla and the foil
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:10.540]   so you can still wrap it up into something is really tough sometimes.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.820]   And then there's the blow out situation which you never want to have.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:18.020]   Anytime I go to Chipotle, I worry about the blow out situation.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.820]   But they go get another, they get another tortito.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:23.100]   And actually that kind of works better because then it mixes all the ingredients together.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.740]   So actually the blow out's okay.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:31.020]   By the way we should point out that the quasadrito is not on the menu at Chipotle.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.820]   It's part of their secret menu.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:37.180]   So you have to know to ask for it.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:41.180]   I think that as for research for the show I really should try it out and let you guys
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.460]   know how it is.
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:48.780]   Can I get somebody to go there right now and get us one before the show's over?
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.580]   No, with a live shot.
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:51.580]   Live shot.
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:54.220]   I think that's a good glass.
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:59.260]   You could have the quesadilla, but you could also have the burrito dilla.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:07.940]   It is a diet friendly alteration of the quesadrito that is essentially a Chipotle quesadilla.
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:12.460]   Dia, except only half the fillings of a regular burrito are sandwiched between heaping handfuls
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.100]   of cheese.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.620]   They will make this for you.
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:19.300]   I have a hard enough time to get them to listen to me to put the right salsa in there.
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.780]   I can't believe he's going to do all that.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:26.220]   Because if the server is not aware of this secret recipe, have the place a handful of
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:29.580]   cheese on one side of the burrito and order about half the amount of fillings of a regular
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.460]   burrito on top of that cheese.
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.820]   Then place another handful of cheese on top of the fillings, fold it in half and place
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:38.580]   it in the giant warmer for a few minutes.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.380]   A grilled...
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:45.140]   Because Taco Bell had the grilled stuffed burrito and they ruined it by putting just
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.740]   basically tons of ward in it.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   Fat.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.500]   The grilled stuffed burrito was a wonderful thing.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.500]   Taco Bell was a...
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500]   All right, now I'm really hungry.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.500]   I'm super excited.
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.500]   We're torture.
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:23:00.100]   This is the torture Gina segment of the show.
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:05.180]   Did you know that originally the Chipotle secret menu was only known to a few lucky
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:08.020]   diners?
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:12.340]   Who knew about the quesadrito, the burrito dilla?
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.060]   I'm envisioning in about 20 minutes Gina and Tapané going around her house saying,
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.060]   "Damn it, Mom, where is your meat thermometer?"
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:24.060]   "There is the meat thermometer."
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.460]   The double wrapped burrito?
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.940]   Did you know about that one?
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:29.100]   I know, I didn't.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.740]   There's all kinds of...
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.740]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:36.420]   The double wrapped burrito is a delicious creation.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:41.060]   If you crave the warm and chewy tortilla shell more than anything else, you're in luck.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:46.540]   Because Chipotle actually lets you get your burrito wrapped in two tortillas, if you wish.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:50.820]   And ask nicely before they are warm up.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:52.780]   Ask them nicely to warm up both the tortillas.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.780]   It's in a giant warmer.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.180]   I want a giant warmer.
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:57.660]   How do we get it?
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:58.660]   How do we get it?
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.660]   This is your fault.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:03.220]   Well, you know, one problem here is that when the...
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.980]   My one gets really slow.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.340]   And so the worst of the line is that the checkout, the colder your meal is by the time
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.340]   you get it.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.340]   Yeah, that's no good.
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.340]   It's a problem.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.940]   All right, here's a quiz question for you.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.780]   Who spent more for acquisitions in 2013?
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:20.660]   Apple or Google?
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:22.220]   Surprise.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.420]   The answer may surprise you.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   Apple has recorded...
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.060]   You should turn that into a BuzzFeed.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.060]   Headline.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.060]   What would the headline be?
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:33.780]   You won't believe.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:34.780]   You won't believe.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.780]   Is that kind of expensive?
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.780]   Who spends more?
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.780]   Who spends more?
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:42.060]   Ah, that's a question.
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.060]   Let's see.
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.300]   Over the past five quarters has officially reported total acquisition investments of
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:53.300]   11.12 billion in addition to a billion in cash business acquisition payments.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.860]   So I think this is all cash.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:25:00.780]   Apple has certainly enough cash to do this.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:11.460]   Google reports spending 7.36 billion for property and equipment, 1.45 billion for acquisitions.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:12.460]   That can't be right.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:16.380]   Google spent more than that on the Nest thermostat.
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:23.060]   What I'd want to know is our investments put into this because I know that with Google
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.860]   Ventures they put in a lot of money.
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:25.860]   Oh, no.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:26.860]   You wouldn't have Google Ventures.
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:27.860]   That's different.
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:28.860]   Right.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:29.860]   That's not an acquisition.
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:30.860]   But also Apple bought like a huge amount of their own stock back.
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.100]   So they may be counting that.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:33.100]   Maybe.
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.100]   They just misread that.
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.100]   That's Apple Insider.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:44.860]   Zite, which for some reason CNN owned, has now been flipped to Flipboard.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.580]   And you might say, oh, they made such a good deal.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:53.260]   But Raffa Ali, founder of Skift, pointed out that it wasn't really, it was bought for
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:55.740]   20 million, supposedly sold for 16 million.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.460]   But not much of that was cash.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.940]   It was assumption of options.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.820]   It was stock back and other things.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:08.060]   So I think CNN didn't know what to do with it and got a good deal getting out.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.060]   It's good though.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.060]   I mean, they made it.
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:11.060]   It belongs at Flipboard.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.220]   Flipboard can do wonderful things.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:17.180]   Zite really was a Flipboard competitor.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:20.620]   But Zite was also adding more of the personalization stuff and they get that in.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:25.460]   When Sarah Bartlett and I were out there, we visited Flipboard and they met their chief
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:30.740]   scientist and they've got neat stuff going on there.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:35.060]   So the Yahoo is turning off both Google and Facebook Connect.
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:36.060]   Sign-ins.
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.260]   I think that's a mistake.
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:39.260]   Is that why?
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.060]   Is that why they feel that that's competitive, why support competitive services?
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.060]   I bet they do.
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:46.580]   But that also means they could get some level of signals.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:51.660]   If you signed into a Yahoo service using Facebook, now Yahoo can know something about you from
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.460]   Facebook and now they lose that opportunity.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.460]   That's silly.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:55.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.100]   I think it's this is also short-sighted that they've been making most, given they've already
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.060]   got these sign-ins and these accounts make more sense to let people link multiple accounts
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.100]   together and give them some isolation.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:10.420]   This is the indie off idea of saying, "Okay, we'll let you sign in with more than one account."
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.940]   That way you've got some protection against those accounts going down or whatever.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.620]   But you've also got the ability to draw information from more than one source.
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:20.020]   There's definitely value off both sides of that.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.740]   I don't get this.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:26.180]   The other thing is that Yahoo's login has historically been pretty bad.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:30.580]   If you used them for open-idealoguing, you would get a 27-digit hex string rather than
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.860]   actually your name showing up when you try to comment on blogs and things.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.860]   Oh, that's not true.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.660]   So there's a bunch of stuff they could improve with when they've been.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:41.380]   Also, I find that it keeps logging me out and then it's much more like it is so I'll
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.980]   continue to reset my password than the others.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.980]   Yahoo, you signed up.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:49.220]   You're still going to do it on Marissa, but Yahoo used to kill accounts regularly if you
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.220]   weren't loyal.
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.220]   Well, they know that.
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:53.420]   The interview was just really frustrating.
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:57.740]   So they were killed a bunch and then they said they could recycle the namespace.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:00.020]   So this was like a couple of months ago.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:04.340]   So you can now get the names of abandoned accounts, which seems like a good thing, but
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:08.860]   except that then you start getting their old mail.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:10.420]   So it's messy.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.860]   So I just went to Yahoo as of now.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:17.900]   If I go to Yahoo.com, I can create a new account or sign in with Facebook or Google so
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.260]   it's still turned on.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:21.820]   Yahoo apparently is doing its own thing.
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:22.820]   Is this OAuth?
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:23.820]   OAuth?
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:29.460]   They have done OAuth based stuff in the past.
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.180]   They've been involved with Open ID Connect, which is OAuth based.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.180]   Certainly.
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:37.020]   I'm not sure how much of how much they still are, but they were definitely part of the
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.540]   contributors to that spec.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:43.980]   So right now, if you say Google, it says Yahoo would like to view your Google email address
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:45.340]   and view basic information.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:50.180]   So this would pre-populate my Yahoo account with stuff from my Google account.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.380]   Oh, it says, do you have a Yahoo account?
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:56.380]   To continue, you need to create a Yahoo account.
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.460]   So then I could create a new one or log in with my existing Yahoo account.
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:03.500]   So now if I do that, I've just channeled stuff from Google into Yahoo.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.700]   Now they know more about me as you pointed out.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.460]   Not a bad thing for them.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:14.500]   On the other hand, if they're trying to promote their own OAuth logins, maybe...
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:17.740]   Yeah, but here's the...
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:22.500]   If I have a relationship with you, cherish that.
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.500]   I went through this.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.340]   I'm staying in a shirt in hotels, a very nice hotel.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:26.580]   It's absolutely fine and dandy.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:29.340]   I had not used my...
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.340]   What do they call it?
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   Who owns this SPG?
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:32.340]   Who's that?
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:33.340]   Starwood.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:36.100]   Hadn't used the Starwood number in a long time.
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:37.100]   So what happens?
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:38.540]   They deactivated my account.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.540]   Oh, that's rude.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:42.060]   Well, look, that's a fine way to treat me when I come back.
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:43.540]   Yeah, no, that's the wrong...
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:44.540]   That's the wrong...
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.540]   Right.
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:47.540]   Of course, I went to Twitter and lined and they fixed it.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:53.180]   It's fine, but whether you're Yahoo or Starwood or any of these companies, if somebody leaves
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:56.740]   you when they come back, don't slap them around.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:57.740]   Welcome them.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:58.740]   Say, "Oh, good.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.540]   We missed you."
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:04.100]   I agree.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:09.060]   Unless, as is the case of the airlines, these affinity groups are losing the money and they
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:10.980]   just are trying to get rid of you.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.220]   They don't want you.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.220]   They were hoping...
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.220]   Well, they already expired my miles.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.580]   Starwood already expired me.
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.820]   Well, that's probably what they wanted to do, right?
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:19.820]   Well, but they...
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:20.820]   No, they got rid of me.
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.820]   They expired anyway.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:22.820]   They didn't have to also kill my account.
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:23.820]   Oh, okay.
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:24.820]   Yeah, I keep the account alive.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:25.820]   You're right.
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.820]   Yeah, that's all I'm saying.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:27.820]   It's same with Yahoo.
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:28.820]   There's...
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:31.100]   I mean, is there cost to maintaining it?
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:32.860]   The Minimas.
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.980]   So Google's got the Loon project.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:37.020]   Facebook has the drone project.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.300]   Now how afraid are you?
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.100]   I don't mind Google balloons over me.
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.940]   I'm not versus Mothra in the skies over the world.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.660]   I love the headline from Wired.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:51.660]   Like drones to battle Google balloons in war of airborne internet.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:56.020]   So you see an animation about what I want to see a cartoon.
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:58.020]   It might be a great video game.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.340]   Can't find any Amazon drones get in there?
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.340]   All the drones.
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:04.660]   That's all according to multiple reports.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.580]   This is kind of like rock, paper, scissors.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:13.300]   Facebook wants to buy a drone maker whose solar powered aircraft could operate as high altitude
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:20.180]   wireless hotspots circling in the stratosphere for years without refueling.
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.900]   So this is similar to the Google.
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:22.900]   You got it.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:28.020]   You know, I always feel like Mark Zuckerberg has a serious case of envy.
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:30.100]   He wants to do everything to everybody else.
[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:32.180]   If you have balloons, I'm going to have drones.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:39.740]   Actually, it's part of his internet.org effort, which is actually a philanthropic effort to
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.740]   bring in a drone.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.740]   Which is more philanthropic, yes.
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.060]   Huge people around the world.
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:45.060]   So that's a good thing.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.260]   And so that's it Leo.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:50.820]   Make fun of the charity, holy well, you know, what's new.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.820]   I'm a jerk.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:56.020]   I had the same reflex that I had to stop myself and say, Oh, there goes the punchline.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:57.020]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:59.020]   Well, all right.
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:05.620]   Google's donating $6.8 million to fund free transit rides for San Francisco youth.
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.620]   That's the story.
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:07.620]   Just doesn't stop.
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:09.820]   Look, possibly go wrong.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:16.900]   Next, next, next Google employees will be throwing candy out of the Google bus to the
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.460]   urchins of the street like World War II going through Belgium.
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:22.620]   I joined gummy.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:30.660]   Silk stockings free, beauty for low income youth program previously paid for by the city
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:36.180]   of San Francisco 31,000 low income youth aged five to 17 have taken advantage of the program.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.420]   It's a good program.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.940]   I think they should let them use the Google bus.
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:41.940]   What is it?
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:45.820]   What's the bus doing after it gets all the employees there brings it back.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.340]   It's just sitting around all day.
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:48.780]   It could take them on field trips.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:49.780]   Take them on field trips.
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.580]   I think the problem is they wanted about the same time.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:53.580]   Well, give them Chromebooks.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:56.780]   They could just lounge in the bus and drive around the city and use the Wi-Fi.
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.780 --> 01:32:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.780]   We're the classrooms.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:02.780]   I like that, Gina.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:03.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:04.780]   That's right.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.780]   I'm Mountain View.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:12.140]   Well, drive Mountain View youth around.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:13.940]   They've got kids in Mountain View.
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:14.940]   Okay.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:17.660]   It doesn't solve the problem though.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.980]   Maybe send the Google buses to Stockton.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.060]   That's where we need them.
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.060]   Yep.
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:25.140]   But let me just say this.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:29.420]   Startups, geeks, come to New York and be here.
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.140]   We're not going to make your lives difficult.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:34.020]   We're not going to go pickety you because you create jobs here.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.900]   We are capitalists in New York.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:39.100]   We believe in innovation.
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:42.300]   It just, to heck with this Silicon Valley stuff, it's over.
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:47.500]   Well you did see Nick Bilton's article in The New York Times about the San Francisco
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.300]   housing market.
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:51.300]   Nick is a great writer.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.300]   Listen to this.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.540]   First couple of graphs.
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:59.340]   Not long ago, the Pink House at 1829 Church Street in the Glen Park neighborhood here hit
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:02.860]   the market for $895,000.
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:11.340]   It's sold for $1.425 million, $530,000 over the asking price in less than two weeks.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:17.300]   It's a fixer upper, three bedrooms, two baths, linoleum floors, Eisenhower era kitchen.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.900]   It's a dump.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.900]   Wow.
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:25.140]   But it's two blocks from the Google bus stop.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.140]   Location, location, location.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.580]   Well, you're a free market man.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.580]   Yep.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:30.580]   Yep.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:31.580]   What a number of people have pointed out.
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.580]   It's not a free market.
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.660]   It's probably you can't actually build anything in San Francisco.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:36.660]   That's exactly the problem, right?
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:42.220]   Well, but I think there are places where what's needed is more housing that's built in places
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.780]   and that's what the government can do.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.940]   But if I owned a house in San Francisco and suddenly somebody wants to impress the market
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.260]   for it, that's going to work.
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:51.260]   According to Redfin...
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:53.020]   No, no, the problem is that there's...
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:57.660]   Well, they're not handing out permits to build new housing and the people who could exist
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.900]   in housing say no, you're not blocking off you.
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.820]   Well, even if they try to sell the housing for less, Mick says you'll have a bidding war
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.780]   from 20 different people.
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:09.100]   That's how it gets so much over the asking of price.
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:14.900]   The average teacher in San Francisco County earns $59,700 a year, not a single home on
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:19.580]   the market in San Francisco is within reach of the average public school teacher.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:23.060]   But it's pretty much always been that when I lived there, I left in '81.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.540]   They be myself badly.
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:29.740]   I don't want to know, Gina, how far away you've been.
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:32.420]   And you couldn't find a place in San Francisco.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:34.380]   It was hard, but it wasn't impossible.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:38.780]   Five years ago, police officers and teachers could have afforded 36% of the homes on the
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.780]   market.
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:44.660]   Today, not one home for teachers and police officers who average $80,000 a year, there's
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.820]   one house in the whole county that they could afford.
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:49.820]   One house.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.940]   They all live in Nevada down the road a piece.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:53.940]   Manhattan too.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:54.940]   Yeah, well, that's the thing.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:55.940]   I mean, I think it's true.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.780]   You know, the goal goes to Chicago.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:04.300]   It is like Manhattan, San Francisco's border, not on four sides by water, but on three sides
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.300]   by water.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.100]   And then the other side on Daily City, nobody wants to live there.
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:10.700]   Everybody wants to live in the Tiki Tiki houses.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:17.420]   So I think that's bad for a city though, when the people who teach your children and
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:19.420]   keep you safe can't afford to live in that city.
[01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:20.420]   But then you can do other things.
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:25.980]   Newark, Cory Booker, put up a whole complex that houses teachers.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:26.980]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.060]   You know, you could do that.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.660]   The city could go.
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.780]   We need a teacher ghetto property.
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:34.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:37.420]   My mother was a public school teacher and, you know, I grew up in Brooklyn and I take
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:41.100]   a train across a bridge every day, get to my office in Manhattan and growing up here,
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.020]   you know, the people like rich people live in Manhattan.
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:46.420]   But that's getting to be that way in Brooklyn too, isn't it?
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:48.420]   Brooklyn has changed a lot.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.420]   It's really gentrified.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.420]   It's very gentrified.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:55.300]   Trying to buy property in Brooklyn was was an eye opening experience for me for sure.
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:57.060]   And I'm like, what did your mother teach?
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:58.060]   What did your mother teach?
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:02.940]   She taught, she taught remedial reading for like 25 years in a public school to students
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:06.100]   who were who were six seventh and eighth grade students who were reading at the second and
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:07.500]   third grade level.
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.220]   So where do you stand on the the Blazio Charter School?
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:12.380]   What was her name?
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:13.380]   Eva.
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.380]   Eva.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:16.060]   What's her name?
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:17.060]   The success schools.
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:19.780]   Yeah, I heard a little bit about this.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:22.100]   I honestly don't know about it enough about it.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:28.940]   So success schools, which was the charter school movement that was championed by Bloomberg.
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.420]   And highlighted in waiting for Superman, the document, the wonderful documentary.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.420]   That was a great documentary.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:39.020]   Fairly controversial because they take over school rooms in regular public schools, push
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.700]   the kids out.
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.780]   They're fairly aggressive about it.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:46.300]   The director makes $475,000 a year.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:51.180]   It is funded entirely by public school funds, not by private funds.
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:55.700]   And the Blazio, is this a give back to the teachers union for supporting them?
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.780]   I think it's a give back to the teachers union because teachers union hates these guys
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:01.940]   because they're all non unionized teachers straight out of college.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:02.940]   Yep.
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:05.500]   So the Blazio hates them.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:09.660]   On the other hand, the success rate of these schools is very high on standardized testing.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:13.300]   They do much, much better than the public schools typically do.
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.300]   It's an interest.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:16.380]   It's a I don't know where to I mean, it's not.
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:19.580]   Yeah, it's it's not an easy issue.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:27.780]   And of course, there's a long waiting list for kids to get into these schools.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.260]   That's not the tragic part.
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:30.620]   I mean, I went to private school.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.300]   My mom taught in public school and I went to private school, but because of the religious
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.140]   aspect of it was really important to my mom.
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:38.820]   My mom wanted me to go to Catholic school.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.620]   So it was in my house was always a very even though my mom thinks about New York City public
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:48.180]   school system is amazing and she loved her school and I come from kind of a weird, weird
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:49.180]   background.
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:50.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:56.860]   Her name is Eva Moskowitz and she's the director of success academy charter schools.
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:57.860]   I don't know.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:58.860]   I mean, she's getting results.
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:38:59.860]   She's getting really good results.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:07.140]   So it's hard to anyway, they serve 6,700 students, 90% black or Hispanic, but they don't
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.820]   have remedial reading.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:17.100]   They don't have, you know, a lot of things that the public schools are required to offer.
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.900]   And they also the schools sound a little different.
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.140]   But anyway, it's an interesting story.
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:25.500]   There's a good article about it in the in the New York Times today in the New York region.
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.300]   See, I read the New York region section pretending that I live in.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.300]   Wow.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:34.180]   I just like to keep up on what's going on in my old town.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.900]   I lived there two years.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:39.700]   You'll be back working in our basement later before you know it.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.340]   The first two years of my life.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:44.420]   I was going to say you qualified open a studio here.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.940]   That counts.
[01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.140]   I do want to do that.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:49.140]   I really do want to do.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.140]   We do too.
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:51.140]   Yeah, we do.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.140]   That's a good idea.
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:53.140]   What is OPA?
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.380]   You're the open source expert, Gina Trippani.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:01.380]   OPA, Google's new open source project allows anyone to create an interactive learning experience.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.860]   Yeah, this looks pretty interesting.
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.020]   And actually, maybe I should have included this in the change law.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.500]   Is this a MOOC?
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.500]   It's a MOOC.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.060]   No, it's a MOOC.
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:13.220]   That what we mean in Brooklyn when we say MOOC.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:21.420]   It's a massively online open -- it's more of a like a teaching thing, right?
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.620]   It's more like a car academy.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:24.620]   Ah.
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.620]   Yes.
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:30.940]   Yeah, like so you can create online courseware using this software, OPA, which is also open
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.940]   source.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.940]   So you can contribute back to it.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940]   It's written in Python.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.940]   I have determined, which is not surprising.
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:36.940]   That's a good thing.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.580]   And yeah, they've got a sample.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:44.100]   If you go to opia.com, they've got kind of a sample exploration.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:48.580]   They call it on the front page so you can see that there's, you know, you can walk through
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:51.980]   solving a math exercise on the front page.
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.540]   It looks pretty cool.
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:56.820]   OPPIA, Opia.
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.380]   Bite size learning journeys.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:40:59.380]   Buy anyone for anyone.
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:05.380]   I think these are really great because I think they really do democratize education.
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:08.940]   How do we talk about this in the show?
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:11.100]   Like this plus help outs is kind of interesting.
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.100]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.100]   I didn't make quite you off.
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.700]   But you can see kind of Google, Google is really, you know, interest in peer to peer
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:22.020]   education and create and providing tools and platforms for people to teach and learn
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.500]   each other, which I really like.
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:27.740]   So I think we had a, I guess we talked about this last week.
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:30.900]   Google itself was running a data analysis class.
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:32.500]   Yeah, this is kind of cool.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.300]   Making sense of data.
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:40.020]   If you go to data sense with Google dot with Google dot com, do you work with surveys, demographic
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.020]   information, evaluation data?
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.380]   This is something people really do need to learn, right?
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:48.860]   It's a self-paced online course for somebody who wants to learn more about how to structure,
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:51.340]   visualize and manipulate data.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.900]   Wow.
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:59.700]   We should, you know, we have 17,000 responses to our survey, which are trying to parse.
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:02.620]   I think Glenn, you need to take this course.
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.620]   Wow.
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:06.420]   March 18th through April 4th.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:11.220]   So it starts in a couple of weeks.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:15.380]   And of course they have to say course availability subject to all applicable laws, regulations
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.980]   and trade sanctions.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:22.940]   That's sad.
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:27.540]   To get to the opia site, it's opia.org.
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:29.140]   That's the hosted version.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:30.620]   Or you can see the code.
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:31.620]   Right.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:33.220]   You can run the code yourself.
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:34.220]   Go.com/opia.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:36.300]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:40.500]   When we come back, we're going to have a tip number and tool and Kevin, anything you want
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.380]   to throw in that mix.
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:45.620]   It's stone soup for the geek.
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:48.460]   But first a word from squarespace.com.
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:51.860]   They're making the web a better place.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:54.380]   One website at a time, maybe yours.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:59.260]   If you're looking for somewhere to host your site, somewhere with great content management
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:06.100]   solutions, tools to make your site look gorgeous, somewhere you can post easily using their
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.100]   apps.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.100]   There's a blog app.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:12.100]   You can moderate comments right from your phone.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:13.540]   You can also do their metric stuff.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:16.620]   They have a new metric app for iPhone and iPad.
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:21.980]   You can check site stats like page views, unique visitors, social media followers.
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:23.860]   Squarespace just gets better and better and better.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:27.500]   And the beauty of this is you can find out all about it by going to squarespace.com and
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:28.500]   trying it.
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:29.500]   Click the get started button.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:33.340]   You'll be picking your template from 25 gorgeous templates.
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:36.460]   But don't worry, template, that's a bad word that means, oh, all the sites must look
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.460]   like cookie cutters.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:38.460]   No.
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:39.460]   No.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:43.500]   In fact, the template is just a starting point that gives you so many rich features.
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.580]   Commerce is built into every template.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:46.580]   They're all mobile responsive.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.140]   So they look good on any screen.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.460]   There's not a separate mobile site.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:55.180]   And yet it's so easy to customize it, not knowing code, but just with drag and drop point
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:57.740]   and click that every squarespace site is unique.
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.780]   These are all with the same template, but they all look different.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:04.780]   They all have the personality of your site.
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.780]   Great support too.
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:11.660]   If you want to help doing this live chat and email support 24/7 from their New York headquarters.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:15.380]   You're not getting somebody who's been looking through a notebook.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.060]   This is somebody who really knows they work there.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:23.340]   Plus a completely resigned customer help site with easy access to self help articles, video
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.340]   workshops.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:27.660]   E-commerce is something a little new at Squarespace.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:31.380]   If you go to the pricing, you'll see it's $8 a month for the basic site.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.260]   And that includes E-commerce.
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:38.340]   You can have, you could sell one item, which for a lot of people, you know, they sell an
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.340]   item.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.340]   They sell a thing.
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.260]   But you could also accept donations.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:46.260]   And that, just think what that means, that means if you're a charity for $8 a month, you
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:49.540]   could set up a gorgeous site where you can accept donations.
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:56.220]   Or if you want to cash a wedding registry right there, a school fund drive, you could do that
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.820]   all for $8 a month with a basic site.
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:00.900]   The professional site's unlimited everything.
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:02.140]   You could sell up to 20 products.
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:03.740]   You get access to the developer platform.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:07.260]   Great for people who know CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
[01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:10.700]   And of course, fully commerce, just $24 a month.
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:13.460]   Squarespace does not take a cut of your commerce.
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:15.460]   You could sell unlimited products.
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:19.780]   Real-time carrier shipping is built into the site, label printing by a ship station, integrated
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.260]   accounting.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:24.780]   And of course, when you register for a year, you get the domain name free, custom domain
[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:26.940]   name and everything.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:27.940]   That's really nice.

[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:36.540]   You can import it for everything from your old website.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:37.620]   See what it feels like.

[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:59.780]   Time, ladies and gentlemen, for Gina's Tip of the Week.
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:02.540]   So I don't remember if I've done this before.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:03.540]   Tell me if I have.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:05.420]   I was short on a tip this week.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:07.860]   But I love this site and I look at it all the time, especially now that I'm here in New
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:10.420]   York and the weather has changed so much.
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.420]   Forecast.io.
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.420]   You've talked about this Leo.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:13.420]   You have to.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.420]   I have to.
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:15.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:17.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:19.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:21.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:26.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:27.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:28.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:48.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:47:08.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:29.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:39.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:46.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:53.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:48:03.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:10.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:15.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:22.420]   It's like the first time I've ever seen this.
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:23.420]   I've got a couple I use.
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:29.420]   I use weather underground because they make a really nice widget,
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:32.420]   which is handy.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:35.420]   It's funny how much we love weather.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:36.420]   There's something about it.
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:37.420]   It matters.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.420]   It matters.
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:39.420]   It matters.
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.420]   It's one called radar now, which is very simple
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:44.420]   and just gives you the animated version of that map.
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.420]   That's nice.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:47.420]   I use Yahoo weather.
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:50.420]   On both iOS and Android, they've done a really nice job.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.420]   It's a 100 one now, have they?
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:56.420]   What's nice about Yahoo weather is they take pictures from Flickr.
[01:48:56.420 --> 01:49:03.420]   If you've got a bunch of cities, you'll get Creative Commons Flickr pictures of those
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:06.420]   cities, which is really cool.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.420]   Oh, in the particular condition?
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:09.420]   Yeah.
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:10.420]   That's really nice.
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:13.420]   Unfortunately, because Petaluma sometimes they'll have downtown Petaluma, which is cool.
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:19.420]   If you slide up, you've got a lot of the forecast I/O stuff, including the maps.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:23.420]   The thing the forecast I/O does is the forward protection, which is nice, where the rain's
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:26.420]   going to be, whereas all of these ones are historic.
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:29.420]   You can look at it and go, "I can see that rainstorm is coming this way," whereas
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:34.420]   forecast I/O says, "Oh, it's going to rain over there," which is also from the way it's
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:35.420]   going to be.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:36.420]   That's cool.
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.420]   I'm just bad at maps.
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:40.420]   When I look at a weather map, I'm like, "I don't know what this means."
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:43.420]   This is what I like about forecasts that I/O is like, "It's like two o'clock to start
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.420]   to rain in your location."
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:46.420]   That's a nice, nice, rare definition.
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:49.420]   I think you need a first and foremost cool light scallions.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:51.420]   It's going to be sunny.
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:52.420]   Never.
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.420]   It never happened.
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:59.420]   Say again, Jeff, does it give you snow accumulation maps that you don't need in California, but
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:00.420]   we do.
[01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:01.420]   It'll tell you.
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:02.420]   Do you give it your location?
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:06.420]   It'll be like two inches tonight, between six inches.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.420]   It'll tell you about what.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:09.420]   Of course, that changes.
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.420]   There was no one point it was predicting sick.
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:12.420]   Which is okay.
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:14.420]   But if you eat an eye on it, it will give you an accumulation.
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:16.420]   The best of them just bury it.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:22.420]   It's like the ethic of the TV weatherman who just keeps on a next segment.
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:23.420]   We'll do next segment.
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:26.420]   We'll do the first site I created on the internet.
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:31.420]   I got so sick of TV weatherman, I created a site that was nothing but five-day forecast.
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:32.420]   That's all I care about.
[01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:33.420]   Really?
[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:34.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:37.420]   We've been here at Wainershine.com, and we sold it to AccuWeather.
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:40.420]   We have tapped into some sort of weather thing here.
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:44.420]   You won't believe what your commute's going to be like tomorrow.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:46.420]   That's literally the tease for local news.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.420]   It makes me crazy.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.420]   I'm like, I just go to the chat that I own.
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:52.420]   I don't need to watch your crappy broadcast.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:55.420]   One other thing I like about the Yahoo thing, because it's connected to Yahoo.
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:58.420]   And this might be a portent of things to come.
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:50:59.420]   They call it smart weather.
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.420]   Easily add friend and family locations.
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:03.420]   You can log into your Facebook or your Yahoo account.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.420]   And it will add all the locations of your friends and family to your maps.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:11.420]   So I can have all of these maps, because I know people in all of these areas.
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:13.420]   Oh, my parents should do that.
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:14.420]   My parents are, God bless them.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:17.420]   We're always calling and saying, "So, get a lot of snow!"
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:22.420]   It says right here, it's snowing.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:23.420]   Yep.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:24.420]   I did.
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:25.420]   You know what?
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.420]   You're taking away from them the one topic of conversation they had.
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:28.420]   I know.
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:29.420]   I shouldn't.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:30.420]   I'm not going to tell them about that.
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:31.420]   I don't know, Mom.
[01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:32.420]   Let me look out the window.
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:34.420]   Oh, look.
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.420]   You're measuring cups.
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:36.420]   They're on the sill.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:39.420]   Because they're measuring the snow.
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.420]   Measuring the snow.
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:41.420]   There we go.
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:43.420]   Put a ruler in it.
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:47.420]   Jeff Jarvis, give us a number.
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:48.420]   Okay.
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:50.420]   I think you teased this and then we didn't do it.
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:51.420]   So I'll do this one.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:52.420]   Okay.
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:59.420]   Google has poured another $50 million into the real estate marketplace auction.com.
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:05.420]   And a $1.2 billion valuation means it's the fourth company that they've invested in that has over a billion dollars
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:07.420]   valuation set another report.
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:08.420]   Wow.
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:13.420]   I just find this fascinating that Google is in the real estate business at any level.
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:19.420]   I think that's real estate business is an incredibly inefficient business.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:25.420]   I always get brokers mad at me when I say this, but real estate brokers do not earn 6%.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:28.420]   And I think it's ripe for disruption.
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.420]   You may get paid 6% using the don't earn it.
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:32.420]   Right.
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:33.420]   I get it.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.420]   Right.
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:36.420]   I mean, I'll get tons of--
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:37.420]   I mean, I'll get tons of--
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:38.420]   Zillow is so great.
[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:39.420]   I love Zillow.
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.420]   I did.
[01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:41.420]   It's great.
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:42.420]   And you know what?
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:48.420]   Every single place that our agent showed us was packed with people and done off for the day after we found a place
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:50.420]   for sale by owner from Zillows just--
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.420]   Wow.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:52.420]   --search.
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:57.420]   I had a search set up that just emailed me listings, new listings, found it through Zillow didn't have to pay the fee.
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:59.420]   You know, we made it off very quickly.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:07.420]   You know, you know, it was-- you know, it was Cochran, which is like the big real estate place here.
[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:10.420]   Zillow did better than my Corcoran agent, sorry, Barbara.
[01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:11.420]   Wow.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.420]   But yeah, no, there's a lot that can be done here, I think.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:20.420]   But did Zillow give you a bottle of champagne and two glasses etched with you and your wife's name on it on the day you bought?
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:21.420]   No, it did not.
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:28.420]   And also, I should say Zillow did send us to a place which was a for sale by owner, and it was clearly turned out after a couple weeks
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:32.420]   going back and forth with the guy, just a guy who wanted to see whether or not he'd get an offer.
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:33.420]   He wasn't serious.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:35.420]   And so he kind of yanked our chain for a bit.
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:37.420]   So like, you haven't had to take the good with the bad, you know?
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:40.420]   You should have done what Mark Zuckerberg did.
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:41.420]   He said, "I like that house.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:44.420]   He sent his agent to knock on the door and said, "How much would you take?
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:46.420]   I'll pay twice what it's worth."
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:47.420]   And the guy said, "Really?
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.420]   Yeah."
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:49.420]   I never heard that.
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:52.420]   When I made my first videos, I thought I'm going to do that.
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:55.420]   Don't you wish somebody could knock at your door and say, "I will pay you--"
[01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:57.420]   Well, that's what he did with "What's Up?"
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:53:59.420]   He--
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.420]   Yeah, right.
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:02.420]   I'll pay you 8,000 times what it's worth.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:04.420]   And it's a wrap, right?
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:05.420]   I mean--
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:07.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:08.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:13.420]   So I'm going to recommend something I've actually recommended on the Mac side, but it's also an Android
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:20.420]   app, but do not look if you do not want to waste time if you do not want to waste time.
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.420]   I don't know why.
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:26.420]   Steve Gibson told me about this, and I've gotten so hooked on this I can't stop playing it.
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:28.020]   It's kind of a simple game.
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.540]   It's called Rails.
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:30.540]   You're doing--
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:35.940]   Basically, what you're doing is you're traffic directing a railroad, but there's something
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:40.180]   so seductive about it that I just can't stop playing it.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:43.820]   Maybe it appeals to the same kind of mind that does gnolling.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:45.460]   You know what gnolling is?
[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:51.340]   That's where you range everything in square right angles on your desk.
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:53.740]   This game trains come out of different stations.
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:58.300]   You've got to route them using switches and lights, so they go to the right station.
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:00.620]   Oh no, the blue train's going to the red station.
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:02.380]   Stop, stop, stop.
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:06.060]   And here comes a blue train going, oh no, I got to get the--
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:07.940]   So anyway, you get the idea.
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:12.380]   It's a lot of fun, and I can't stop playing it, and it's Buck 99.
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:14.660]   For those who graduate from Thomas the Tank Engine.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.820]   This is like grown up Thomas the Tank Engine.
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:20.660]   I earned 175 coins and set a new record.
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:21.660]   Wow.
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:22.660]   So you start--
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:23.660]   Wow, I'm not a gamer.
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.660]   You would love this.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:27.420]   No, I know where it would be.
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:28.740]   I don't like games.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:30.780]   I don't like crossword puzzles.
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:31.660]   You would love this.
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.740]   You draw lines.
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:34.500]   I try.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.980]   You connect games.
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:38.820]   I did dots like twice, and I said, what's the point?
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:39.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:42.300]   You actually want to be productive or something.
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:42.940]   Is that it?
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:44.140]   Yeah.
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:45.860]   Oh, see, I don't care, really.
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:47.020]   I'm just a podcaster.
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:48.660]   I don't need to be productive.
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.220]   I just sit here and talk.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:51.060]   What do I need?
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:51.940]   I'm not productive.
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:52.620]   I'm on Twitter.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:52.900]   And I--
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:53.460]   Yeah, right.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:54.900]   Yeah, Twitter, that's productive.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:56.260]   I know.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:00.020]   Thank you, by the way, for sending me a bunch of selfies.
[01:56:00.020 --> 01:56:06.180]   People using their dogs to create parody selfies.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:07.180]   Let me pause this game.
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:07.940]   I want to save that.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:13.180]   That's Rails, book 99.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:14.500]   David Letterman.
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:17.700]   David Letterman did his own Oscar.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:18.380]   Oh, there's a movie.
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:19.820]   You want to watch the movie of Trains?
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:21.100]   Now, you already just saw that.
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:22.220]   No, I don't.
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:22.740]   No.
[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:23.940]   Come on, you want to play this game?
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:24.500]   I know you do.
[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:25.780]   No, I don't.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:27.060]   This isn't a good--
[01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:28.540]   this is not good.
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:30.620]   What is good about this?
[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:31.860]   This is not even funny.
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:32.380]   Is this a letter to coffee?
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:33.540]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:33.940]   I think--
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:34.820]   Because I don't know what a better bad--
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.020]   David.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:36.540]   Yeah.
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.740]   You got some competition.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:38.420]   You got Kimmel.
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:39.860]   You got Conan.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:40.780]   You got Fallon.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:41.820]   What are you doing?
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.820]   This isn't funny.
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:48.260]   Let's see, even the point of this.
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:48.620]   All right.
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.100]   Love you, babe.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:50.260]   But--
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.580]   And you know how many retweets he got?
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:53.500]   67.
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:59.780]   Now, if Kevin Spacey were making a face in the back, then--
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:00.620]   you know what?
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:02.660]   We're going to do when we get Kevin here.
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:06.460]   We're going to do a selfie and have him make that face.
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:07.620]   Oh, that would be great.
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.260]   Then, how-- yeah.
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.740]   You've seen, of course, the people
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:15.860]   who've made the Kevin Spacey selfie.
[01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:18.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.740]   OK, that's a good one.
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.660]   Ah!
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.780]   It's creepy.
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:25.500]   Ladies and gentlemen, this week in Google
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:28.940]   has come grinding to a halt.
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:30.940]   Apparently, it's gone dark as well.
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:34.940]   The show would be nothing without its panelists.
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.300]   And we thank you, Kevin Marks, for joining us.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.820]   Kevin is not gainfully employed.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:40.700]   So if anybody'd like to give this guy a job
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:41.620]   and get him out of his--
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.620]   The brilliant, the brilliant Kevin Marker.
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.780]   The wonderful, the brilliant, the talented.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.900]   Let me tell you something.
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:51.260]   This guy, he's English.
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:53.540]   He's got a posh accent.
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.460]   He'll add some class to your joint.
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:56.460]   You never did his thing.
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:56.900]   That's right, right.
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:58.860]   What thing?
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:00.860]   Gene does a tip, and he does a number.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:01.420]   Kevin does a tip.
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:02.300]   He did his things.
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.540]   He did 18 weather apps.
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:04.340]   What are you talking about?
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:05.340]   I'm talking about the weather.
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:06.780]   The thing I was going to mention is
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:08.980]   that this weekend in San Francisco--
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:09.980]   Oh, we want to plug this.
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:11.820]   --is emptied out to South by Southwest.
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:12.100]   Yes.
[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:16.180]   We've got Indie Web Camp, which is the camp for people
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:17.660]   who are creating the Indie Web.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:18.980]   And there's a few places left.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:23.380]   So if you're interested in building an independent web,
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:26.300]   then-- and you're actually doing it, then come on on to Indie
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:27.060]   Web Camp.
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:29.140]   What does this mean?
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.780]   Is this like your-- how--
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:33.940]   Indie how?
[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:36.380]   Basically hosting your own site,
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:39.740]   connecting to other sites, bridging out
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.260]   to the large silos like Google and Facebook,
[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:45.780]   but not making them the center of your web experience.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:46.900]   Excellent.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:47.900]   Excellent.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:51.500]   I don't want to go to the mall because I'm tired, but--
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:52.380]   Yes.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:56.500]   Did any of you consider going to South by Southwest this year?
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:59.020]   I thought about it and decided that it wasn't worth what it
[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:00.420]   would cost.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:02.020]   Because it's so much more expensive now
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.140]   than it was a couple of years ago.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:04.660]   Is it how much is it?
[01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:06.340]   Well, it's not the conference itself.
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:08.100]   It's just that it's so overloaded that--
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:08.700]   I'm just going.
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:12.020]   --actually fly there and get some way to stay and so on.
[01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:13.220]   I was looking at lots and lots of money.
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:14.540]   I was like, ah, no.
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.060]   It's a great party.
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:18.500]   I don't know if there's much information there.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:21.860]   I think we're going to do a special--
[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:22.500]   Well, I said--
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:25.300]   --at some point with--
[01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:26.420]   talk a little bit about what's going on.
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:28.260]   If something big is happening there, we'll cover it.
[01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:29.700]   But it seems mostly it's--
[01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:32.260]   It used to be a place for the independent people to go
[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:34.260]   because it was cheap and it was a way to get together
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:34.980]   in the spring.
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:36.580]   And people from all over America
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:38.820]   would go out and chat about the latest web staff.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:39.340]   It's fun.
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.460]   And it's become such a corporate thing now.
[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:43.620]   You could only really afford to go if you could
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:44.940]   expense the whole thing.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:47.220]   And that's why I saw a piece of it.
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:48.820]   Now I've seen the marketing people
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:51.220]   are saying that it's over and I'm thinking, well,
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:53.540]   you're the guys who ruined it and then you abandoned it.
[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:56.860]   Every app in the world wanted to duplicate
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.820]   Twitter and four squares experience there
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.380]   and it just became crazy.
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:01.900]   It's too bad.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:03.500]   Anyway, it's a fun party.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:03.940]   I would go.
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:07.500]   I just can't justify it to go for a party.
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:10.940]   Yeah, I couldn't justify it the past the time.
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:12.940]   Isn't that sad?
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:14.900]   If anything was our thing.
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:16.380]   Our thing, yeah, if anything.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:23.620]   I should give, actually, you have a lot of good things.
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:27.180]   Kevin Marks, fixpatents.org.
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:28.460]   Well, fixpatents are always a site
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:30.420]   that I put up a while ago and it's a bit scruffy looking
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.020]   at the moment.
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:31.780]   That's your site.
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.500]   I want to know that.
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:40.140]   But Julie Powell, who was the EFF,
[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:43.180]   was the Mark Cuban chair of fixing stupid patents,
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:45.700]   has moved to engine advocacy.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:46.780]   Really?
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:50.820]   Putting up a big campaign site around all the new patent
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:51.300]   bills.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:53.300]   Engine.is.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:53.980]   Yes.
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:57.700]   So they asked if they could use fixed patents at all.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:58.700]   And I said, yes, please do.
[02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:01.380]   So that's going to change from being an ugly site
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:04.500]   that I made one day because I was grumpy.
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.060]   I'm going to be in a place where they're actually
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:07.700]   campaigning to actually fix patents
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:09.620]   because there are four or five doors going to Congress.
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:14.420]   So what is somebody going to take her place at EFF?
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:16.100]   Well, she's still doing the patent stuff here.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:18.300]   She's taking the patent campaign with her to engine
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:21.500]   advocacy and EFF is going to continue campaigning on it, too.
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:22.660]   Good.
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:24.300]   It's really important.
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:25.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:25.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:27.980]   It's something that impacts a lot of tech.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:29.540]   That's a nice sign.
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:32.460]   But there's an engine engine engine, a smart group.
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.500]   I've been impressed with them.
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:37.260]   They've been thinking about these issues
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:40.180]   and working out how to translate between the tech world
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:41.820]   and DC for quite a while.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:45.020]   So I'm very encouraged to do this one there.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:50.260]   And you can follow them on Twitter @engineadvocacy.
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:53.660]   And you can follow Kevin Marks at Kevin Marks.
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:55.020]   Yes, or Kevin Marks.com.
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:57.700]   Or Kevin Marks.com or Picture of My Table.
[02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:01.780]   I just threw that in.
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:02.540]   That's myself.
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:03.340]   This is pretty ugly.
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:03.940]   What do you think?
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:04.940]   It's indie.
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:08.460]   Well, this is scruffy.
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.700]   It's a scruffy table.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:11.740]   It's all scratched up.
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.620]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:16.020]   at CUNY, City University.
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.460]   New York CUNY.
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:18.740]   He also is in Brussels.
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:20.620]   What are you doing in Brussels?
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:24.460]   I was speaking for a group of EU bureaucrats.
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:25.900]   And is what time is it?
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:27.260]   Like midnight?
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.220]   It is quarter to one.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.780]   We're going to put you to bed right now.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:32.060]   I'm tired.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.020]   Thanks for staying up.
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:35.700]   I also had, after I made fun of Starwood before,
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:39.220]   at least the Sheraton Wi-Fi, I paid for the deluxe
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:40.300]   or the wired internet.
[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:41.580]   No, it worked really well.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:43.900]   I thank you and we'll reimburse you for that deluxe.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:44.940]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:45.780]   It's fine.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:48.900]   And that heavenly bed's calling to you right now.
[02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:51.380]   I can't wait.
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:54.820]   Actually, you can actually buy the heavenly bed at some store.
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:57.060]   And I'm so tempted to.
[02:02:57.060 --> 02:02:58.860]   I love it.
[02:02:58.860 --> 02:02:59.300]   I actually--
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.100]   What about that?
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:01.140]   Yeah.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.300]   You remember the heavenly bed?
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.140]   Who could forget?
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:05.420]   That's not really bad, yeah.
[02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:07.940]   You can get it at westernhotels@home.com.
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:10.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:13.460]   It's only-- holy cow, it's expensive.
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:14.700]   OK.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.140]   Be cheaper, just go stay at the hotel, frankly.
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:20.700]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:21.860]   I don't know if I have the budget for that.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:23.540]   But that's nice to think about.
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:28.500]   It includes 10 layers of pure comfort.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.900]   Gina Trapani--
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:30.420]   Indeed.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:31.060]   Wow.
[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:32.460]   --has a cot in the basement.
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:36.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:36.700]   And she is--
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:38.220]   Her mother is holding her prisoner.
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:40.300]   So comfortable there.
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:41.900]   Someday I will be in my own home.
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:42.660]   Oh, no.
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:43.220]   Yes.
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:45.100]   You got a jet splanket down there.
[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:46.500]   You got homo figurines.
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:49.060]   It got national geographic's going back to 1938.
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:49.980]   There's no reason--
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:52.420]   I want you to do a panorama shot before you leave it.
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:54.860]   OK, one shot of the basement.
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:56.860]   Before-- before--
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:57.340]   right now?
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:59.060]   Oh, no, before I leave.
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:03:59.820]   Before you leave.
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:00.820]   Before you leave.
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:01.340]   OK.
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:03.020]   You can see the elephants.
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:03.520]   Yeah.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:04.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:06.020]   You've seen all of the family pictures.
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:07.580]   Oh, that's beautiful.
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:08.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:09.860]   An actual Tiffany lamp.
[02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:11.860]   A Tiffany lamp, please, Jenna.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.060]   Oh, I mean, this is cozy.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:16.500]   Yeah, it's totally-- yeah, you've got the low ceiling
[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:17.700]   and the crazy light.
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:18.580]   I don't know.
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:20.380]   Yeah, it's nuts down here.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.540]   You could film a scene of the Sopranos down there.
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:23.500]   I'm telling you.
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:23.940]   Absolutely.
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:24.500]   Absolutely.
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:24.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:26.580]   It's getting nuts down here.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:27.900]   We're going into the mattresses.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:29.740]   Everybody.
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:31.020]   Thank you, Gina.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:31.940]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:32.620]   Thank you, Kevin.
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:33.100]   Great to be here.
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:34.020]   Thanks to all of you.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:35.980]   Gina, by the way, is on all about Android every Tuesday,

[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:43.740]   And it's thanks to you.
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:44.420]   Yeah, Jason.
[02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:45.500]   It's all Jason.
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:46.380]   It's all Jason.
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.420]   Great job.
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:49.220]   Aaron Newcomb, Ron Richards.
[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:51.420]   Great team there.

[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:14.820]   That cast is aggregated here.
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:18.980]   Mostly like the iTunes, the Stitchit places like that.
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:20.260]   So go on and do that.
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:22.700]   And we will see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:23.700]   Bye-bye.
