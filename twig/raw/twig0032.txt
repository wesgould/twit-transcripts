[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.240]   This week in Google, the show that covers everything
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.840]   having to do with the Google verse and the cloud, not just
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.600]   Google.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920]   And joining us today, we're very happy to have a per-genus
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.720]   recommendation, Kevin Purdy, who is--
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.600]   Hello.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.280]   --the per-man, we call him.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.800]   He is at Life Hacker.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.880]   What is your title at Life Hacker?
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.600]   Senior Editor.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.080]   Senior Editor at Life Hacker.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.600]   How long have you been there?
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.160]   Two years.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.840]   That makes you senior in the gocker verse.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.280]   Yes.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.440]   Boy does it.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.200]   You have someone Nick, don't you?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   Oh.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.520]   Not really.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.400]   Jeff Jarvis is also your author of What Would Google Do?
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.840]   His blog, Smart Machine--
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.120]   I mixed Buzz Machine in smarter wear.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.120]   Buzzer wear.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.800]   From Buzz Machine.com, Buzz Machine.com is the website.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.480]   Also here from smarterwear.org, Gina Tripani,
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.400]   also author of the Complete Wave Guide to Google.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.360]   The Complete Google Guide to Wave.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.080]   The Complete Guide to Google Wave.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   There you go.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.360]   At completewaveguide.com.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yes.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   That's it.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.720]   Yay.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.680]   I got it all eventually.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.800]   Hello, kids.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.360]   Now, you didn't get your slank yet.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.920]   I'm sorry to say, Jeff.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.600]   No, I didn't.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.920]   I'd be wearing it now.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.480]   But my postal service is clearly behind.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.760]   Well, you actually benefit because Gina and I
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   have had the experience of being slankated.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.520]   Yes, we have.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.880]   I have a black shirt on right now.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.120]   I couldn't put the slank it on because it would be red.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.120]   Red fuzz.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.360]   Smells like a mafia napkin.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.320]   It's heavenly, though.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.200]   The slank is heavenly.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.600]   And it will be in Austin next week.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.040]   Precise.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.480]   Oh, will it?
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.760]   Good.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.320]   I'll bring mine as well.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.360]   It's a bit of a thing to pack.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.680]   It is.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.600]   I was like, why did Leo ship this to me here?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.040]   I got to get this in my bag.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.520]   I should have brought it to Austin.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.960]   But then you'd have to bring it home.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.720]   You should have shipped those things where you can vacuum suck
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.280]   the air out of a new plastic bag.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.400]   Yeah, good call.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.200]   Excellent.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.920]   Excellent.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.360]   Today we talk about all the Google stories.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.480]   And I guess story number-- well, I don't know.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.160]   Shopping spree, story number one.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.640]   Well, can we talk about the Gorgorian chant for a minute
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.160]   while we're on the slank it?
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.920]   We have a Gorgorian chant.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.080]   Did you see that?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   That was just incredible.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.920]   Are we going to play that?
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.080]   You want me to play it?
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.760]   I think we should.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.200]   I don't even know how to find it.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.080]   I guess if I search for a Gorgorian chant off, Google
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.920]   Lorian--
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.000]   There was something on the front of the friend feed.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.080]   It's on the friend feed.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.280]   Leo, your Twitter--
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.320]   I tweeted it.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.640]   You tweeted it.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.800]   And I have to thank the guy who sent it to us.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.080]   Let me find it and play it.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.680]   Scared me.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.720]   I couldn't listen for it.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.000]   I suppose we should do that last.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.640]   I suppose the chant--
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.000]   All right.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.840]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.400]   That's what we'll do.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.760]   It's Rob Houghton did it for us.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   Because we were talking last week about wearing our slankets,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.240]   which look like monk's robes, and walking down the streets
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.960]   of Austin, humming the Gorgorian chant.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.440]   I'll tell you what.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.400]   I'll just play a little bit of it.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.040]   And then I'll play the full version for you
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.800]   at the end of the show.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.320]   How about that?
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   It is dramatic.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.640]   It is beautiful.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.120]   It is very, very Google-ian.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:45.920]   You get the idea.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.600]   It's very good.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   It goes on for a couple minutes.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.520]   And it gets very jazzy.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.440]   And people have been complaining,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.520]   and I don't blame them about the silly music
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.200]   that I started this show with some silly classical thing.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.400]   I had this notion that there would be the three of us,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.280]   and it was kind of like we were fugging with each other.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.680]   And I should do some counterpoint.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.600]   And it just was a bad idea.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.880]   So we'll find a better theme.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.760]   And this might be ending.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.400]   It's not very cloudy, though, the classical theme.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.520]   That was the idea.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.640]   It was Google and the cloud.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.960]   That's exactly right.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.080]   You introduced it as not just about Google with the cloud,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.920]   too, but I think it works.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.160]   The problem with theme music is, unless you use real music,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.760]   it all sounds like bad local news themes.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.320]   And now, the action news team, Gina Trapani with sports,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.640]   Jeff Jarvis with the weather, and Kevin Perdi with the news.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   Does it?
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.960]   It's feeling very anchorman right now.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.300]   Crew you, San Diego.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.160]   No, I wasn't quite like that.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.160]   Anyway.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   Stay classy.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.660]   Stay classy.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.300]   I'm going to do my best, not that I ever have been.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.860]   So there we go.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.100]   You wanted to start with the Gluorin chant we have.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.180]   And thanks to Rob for that.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.300]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.280]   We have a wonderful community.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.500]   And the lyrics are on the drop.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.620]   I don't know if we could post them somewhere else.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.060]   But the lyrics aren't easy to hear.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.740]   Yeah, it says, in the name of Larry and Sergey and Eric
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.020]   Schmidt, Google will do no evil and will serve the user.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.700]   We will do it quickly and do it well.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.740]   All love and consciousness is given to the holy algorithm.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.100]   So says this Gluorin chant.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.580]   That's pretty--
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.580]   That's a must.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.740]   Pretty good?
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.500]   That's pretty good.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.580]   It's really funny.
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.300]   It says, then it says, can the old farts in the back row
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.500]   get the written lyrics?
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.340]   Yes, thank you.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.460]   We got it as one of them.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.620]   So picnic was one of the acquisitions.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.820]   What else did Google buy?
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.100]   Have they been buying a lot of stuff?
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.100]   Docverse.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.900]   Yeah, that's those two big ones.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.540]   What is Docverse?
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.540]   Docverse.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.740]   Docverse.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.860]   Not first.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.100]   I haven't used it, but I think it's a plug-in to Microsoft
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.580]   Office that lets you sync files to the cloud.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.060]   Oh, I was using it.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.260]   It says, show across the bell, Microsoft, what it is.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.460]   Sync in and edit and collaborate on.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.820]   I gave it-- so our chief financial officer here,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.260]   we were making her use Google spreadsheet,
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.340]   and she said it's too slow.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.860]   It's too awful.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.340]   I need to use Excel.
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.380]   So I gave her this Docverse.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.300]   So she could use Excel with Google Docs, which is what we--
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.300]   we're all Google Docs, all about Google Docs here.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.060]   It's a great idea.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.300]   So does it sync the documents to Google Docs,
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.260]   or is it a separate server?
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.060]   That's a good question.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.740]   Apparently, it's very transparent.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:46.780]   And my sense is it basically lets you use it as if Excel
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.180]   is a Google Doc.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.580]   Although--
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.580]   Right.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.220]   So the document's located in the cloud,
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.380]   and you can collaborate, and the changes sync to the cloud.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.460]   This is a lot like Microsoft Live Workspace, which I've
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.700]   been using for my book.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.660]   My copy editor said, I want to work in Word,
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.460]   and Google Docs just didn't have certain features,
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.620]   advanced features that we needed,
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.420]   like building a table of contents and that kind of thing.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.500]   So Google Docs does a lot, but not all the stuff that Word does.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.700]   So we started using Microsoft Live Workspace,
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.140]   which means that I download the file to Word, edit it.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.660]   And when I save it, it saves back up to the cloud.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.460]   And it worked.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.380]   I was surprised at how well it worked.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.660]   Sorry, Microsoft.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.700]   But it sounds like Docverse is the same thing.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.260]   So this is just Google's way of saying,
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.860]   if Docs doesn't do what you want, well, you can use Word and Excel
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.780]   on your desktop, but you can sync to the cloud.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.940]   So it makes a lot of sense.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.700]   Ours Technica says it's also a direct competitor for SharePoint,
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.540]   which is--
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.100]   I gotta say, it's one of the Microsoft products
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.540]   that even open source geeks are kind of like the ones
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.860]   that I know seem to enjoy SharePoint, at least
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.740]   find it a pretty good product.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:55.780]   Yeah, I mean, if Google wants to make a credible sharing system,
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.860]   if it wants businesses to move to Google Apps,
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.060]   it needs to have a lot of those features.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.740]   And the problem is that businesses use Office.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.860]   And so-- but right now, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.260]   but I think I can save an Excel spreadsheet to my office,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.020]   my apps space, and then use it.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.700]   So I'm not sure exactly what Docverse does that's different.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.780]   I guess it's versioning is the difference.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.020]   And also, bridge my gap in compatibility.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.380]   Like Gina was saying, there's little--
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.060]   and you were saying to these little tiny compatibility
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.500]   problems.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.860]   No, but I'm saying I can use Excel with Google Docs.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.700]   And so I create a spreadsheet with Excel.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.420]   So I get all the Excel features.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.500]   I save it up to Google Docs.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.100]   And it's there.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.020]   And then I share it.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.580]   And so anybody who's using Excel can get it.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.020]   You upload it to Google Docs as a file,
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.540]   or you import it into Google Docs.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.740]   And now the spreadsheet is in Docs.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.100]   You can open it up.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.660]   No, no, we continue to use Excel.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.580]   Oh, interesting.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.100]   I'm going to have to play with this,
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.220]   because she's been using it.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.420]   And I'm not sure how she's doing it.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.780]   And I'm not sure exactly how it works.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.300]   Maybe somebody in the chat room can give us a tip
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.180]   how this is different from what Docverse does.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.260]   But it is clearly the right thing for Google to do.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.580]   And it is a shot across Microsoft's Valve course.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.340]   Yeah, no doubt.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.500]   So Google Docs lacks the versioning--
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.940]   they're saying the versioning capability of Docverse.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.140]   And that's very important.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.420]   Very much so, especially when you have a copy editor who--
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.220]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.540]   Who did what went?
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.300]   Track changes was a huge thing that I use with my book.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.940]   Accepting those changes and that kind of thing.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.260]   Good.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.500]   So I for one am happy about this,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.740]   because SharePoint is expensive.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.180]   You've got to run a server.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.060]   It's a big deal.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.100]   It's heavy.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.660]   And we use a hosted exchange server
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.060]   that gives us SharePoint capability.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.900]   But it seems like overkill for what we're just so happy
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.820]   with Google Docs.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.620]   And it's just a few of us--
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.300]   it's these special cases, like your editor who
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.660]   has to use Word or my CFO who has to use Excel.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.500]   Those are the places where Google has been a little bit
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.220]   behind, and I think this is great.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.260]   And it makes tons of sense if Google is trying to hit
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.300]   the Enterprise with Google Apps, if Docs--
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.140]   Apps for Enterprise is going to include Docs.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.780]   They can say, hey, you can just install this plugin
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.300]   for Microsoft Office, and you're using Google Docs.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.620]   And as I remember, it was free.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.100]   Go ahead.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.620]   And they also just introduced the universal any file,
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.860]   upload, Google Docs just did.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.360]   Right.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.300]   That's what I've been using.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.500]   That's that new feature that I was using that led me up
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.300]   to upload Excel.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.380]   It doesn't matter what file it is.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.980]   You can get a gig of space, I think.
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.100]   Right.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.140]   So basically what it is is like using Dropbox or something
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.420]   as a shared storage, but it's not
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.340]   smart about what's going on.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:45.860]   Right.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.020]   I mean, with this, you're editing the document.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.500]   You hit Control+S to save it, and it saves it directly
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.700]   to the cloud.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.420]   You're not manually uploading versions or anything.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.940]   Well, in the simultaneous--
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.140]   even Excel doesn't have locking, you
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.860]   have to use SharePoint to have multiple users on an Excel
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.380]   spreadsheet.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.460]   This does that too.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.020]   And that's huge.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.660]   That's huge.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.140]   That's really huge.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.380]   OK, so the other company they bought is Picnic.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.060]   And one more.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.900]   We'll get to it in a second.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.420]   Yes.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.300]   So I've been using Picnic on Flickr.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.420]   Does it leave Flickr now?
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.780]   Oh, there was a story about top six questions about Picnic.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.260]   Let me see if I can find it again.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.020]   I see NIK, completely confusing spelling.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.060]   But it's a photo editor.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.060]   When you're on Flickr and you want to flip a photo or crop
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.580]   a photo or do some minor touch up,
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.340]   Picnic is a really handy way to do it.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.180]   It's not going to replace Photoshop by any means.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.180]   But obviously, Google's plan is to make it part of Picasso
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.900]   web, I would presume, or maybe even--
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.260]   I don't know.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.820]   What do they need this for?
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.060]   This is a Chrome OS thing.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.540]   Oh.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.900]   This is my theory.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.700]   This is Google just saying, hey, look, you've
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.860]   got a photo editor on right on your non-Desktop.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.500]   Because any Linux user or any iOS user,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.860]   the first question is, can I run Photoshop on it?
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.420]   Exactly.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:08.920]   Always.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.340]   Or something like Photoshop.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.620]   No, that's very interesting.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.620]   Yeah, this is definitely.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.300]   This is a Chrome OS move, I think.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.300]   So should we expect Google to acquire more web-based
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.860]   technologies like Picnic to add capability to Chrome OS?
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.300]   Is there a web-based version of Final Cut out there?
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.500]   Oh.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.940]   Yes.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.780]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:29.980]   That was awesome.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.260]   I think there is.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.060]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.860]   Is there any that's as good as--
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.780]   that's actually--
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.860]   Well, you can't maybe do Avatar on it.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.380]   You know what I'm so--
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.940]   So think about Picnic versus Photoshop.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.620]   Just pisses me off every time I launch it,
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.340]   because it takes 25 minutes to launch,
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.180]   because it's got so much.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.060]   And all I want to do is crop a photo.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.100]   I'm really surprised that Google didn't acquire Aviary.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.300]   Are you familiar with Aviary?
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.260]   This is like Photoshop.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.860]   Aviary is really powerful for being a cloud-based app.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.140]   It's scary almost.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.100]   Is it image editor, color editor, effects editor, vector
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.500]   editor, so it's got kind of free hand.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.420]   It's got screen capture.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.300]   It's got image markup.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.100]   It has now an audio editor.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.620]   I think a photo or a video editor
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.380]   is probably just around the corner from this company.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.780]   Just last week, Aviary also went totally free.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.260]   They had been charging a premium for, I think,
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.060]   like making your files private and such.
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.020]   But now Aviary is a totally free online app to everyone.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.300]   Now, here's the question.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.780]   All this stuff uses Flash, right?
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.260]   Yes, Aviary does.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.140]   Does Google-- I mean, Picnic uses Flash too.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.980]   Does Google really want to get in the business of Flash tools
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.660]   on Chromium OS?
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.020]   That's a good question.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.500]   That is--
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.380]   How hard is it to port this, to port something like this to HTML5?
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.900]   Is it possible?
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.540]   Well, it's possible, but I don't think it's easy.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.820]   I mean, I think that if you've done everything in ActionScript,
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   you've done it in ActionScript.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.140]   It's not--
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.500]   Yeah, I mean, and the issue is really like,
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.140]   browser support too right now.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.740]   What you'd really want is a JavaScript version of these.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.540]   But I don't know.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.100]   I mean, maybe that's why they didn't do Aviary,
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.740]   because Aviary really is very, very tied to Flash.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.860]   We've posted about in a life hacker last week,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.980]   an app called Sketchpad, mugtug.com/sketchpad.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.180]   And that's all HTML5.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.620]   That's what it's want.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.220]   Yeah, it's pretty impressive, actually, for--
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.380]   I mean, it's only got 12 tools, a few sliders
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.220]   and a few controls.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.740]   But it's a pretty impressive app for totally coded in HTML5.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.340]   No Flash, no Silverlight, no--
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.660]   right on your browser.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.820]   So like, cool.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.060]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.820]   Superful.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.320]   Wow.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.420]   So Google could-- I mean, Google's a pretty big proponent
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.180]   of HTML5.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.900]   I could see them working with the picnic folks
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.900]   to transition, or at least I hope.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.420]   So if I wrong or--
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.900]   it strikes me that-- well, I can tell you one reason I thought
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.220]   picnic was flashes, because I wouldn't load in my Safari
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.420]   browser, which is flashes screwed up on it.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.140]   Let me see.
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.300]   It may just be the front page is flashy.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.420]   I don't know.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.340]   I'm pretty sure picnic is Flash-based, but maybe not.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.700]   Maybe it's Java.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.180]   Java's OK to Chromium OS, right?
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.540]   Or are they trying to do everything HTML5?
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.380]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:16.880]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.260]   And is Flash definitely out on Chromalas?
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:19.820]   Well, you--
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.940]   Well, no, you've got to be able to use Flash or else
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.980]   you're in the same boat as having an iPhone.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.420]   Yeah, but you would ultimately--
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.420]   Yeah, right.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.500]   --you do all the stuff.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:26.820]   Right?
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.260]   I mean, that's all Flash.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.060]   But when you want to choose Flash ultimately
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.300]   and make it HTML5, I mean, isn't that really the long--
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:42.460]   --l
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.220]   is written in Flex, which is Adobe's Flash-based flam--
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.980]   --flam work.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.100]   So it is effectively Flash.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.820]   I don't know.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.940]   Now, that's a really interesting question.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.620]   I just assumed that Google was as dogmatic about Flash's apple
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:56.820]   was.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.620]   Maybe they're not.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:04.420]   I mean, wouldn't they want to be standards-based?
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.620]   I mean, you might include Flash compatibility for flexibility,
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.980]   but you really want to be standards-based.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.460]   Right, but that's a big case with their hiring their team.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.780]   Yes, that's right.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.060]   Google's done that before.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.340]   Yeah, plenty of times.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.940]   But when you have a device like the iPad coming out
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.420]   with video capabilities without Flash,
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.180]   but with the ability to watch video,
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.860]   I mean, you also don't want to ship Chrome OS for netbooks
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.840]   without the ability to watch video or stream audio using
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.140]   Flash.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.940]   I mean, because the only option is Flash, right?
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.540]   Because there's nothing but the browser.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.220]   So it seems like even though Apple made the decision
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.140]   not to include Flash and Google has an interest in not
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.900]   including Flash, speed being the primary one, right?
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.900]   It still seems like they've got a really good reason to include it.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.980]   So people can play games and watch video.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.740]   Right, right.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.580]   But if they release the Chrome OS netbook without Hulu on it,
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.860]   that'll be the headline for the next three days.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.780]   I mean, you'll have to release it like, where's Hulu?
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.860]   Where's Hulu?
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.620]   Oh, man, though, if I were Google,
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.260]   I wouldn't want to support Hulu.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.260]   I mean, Hulu's the enemy if you're YouTube.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.620]   Hey, by the way, big profits for YouTube, at least according
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.220]   to one analyst.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.700]   We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.380]   Also, the Apple lawsuits.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.380]   Before we do that, though, let me mention our friends
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.500]   that go to assist express.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.180]   Go to assist is a product from Citrix,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.740]   which does a remote access, of course.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.620]   And they're the kings of remote access.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.180]   They created it for Windows NT.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.700]   Microsoft licensed it.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.220]   And in enterprise, Citrix is the name.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.180]   But they've got consumer applications that are just fantastic.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.820]   Go to me and go to my PC.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.620]   This is one not exactly for consumers.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.780]   It's for the support professional.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.460]   The IT person or somebody who has software to support.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:46.140]   I have to say I use it because I am my mother's support person.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.660]   And so when mom needs some help, I just fire up, go to assist.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.420]   Now, the beauty of this is she didn't have to have it installed.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.740]   In fact, we were just skyping.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.740]   And she said, I've got a problem with--
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.660]   I can't figure out where my quickened data is.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.780]   So I had to go to assist install to my system,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.660]   by the way, Mac or PC.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.780]   And I just said, OK, fine, here's a link.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.460]   Click this.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.540]   Send it in the Skype chat.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.300]   She clicked the link.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.460]   Within seconds, go to assist was installed.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.300]   And I was able to fix the problem like that.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   Go to assist is designed for support for several reasons.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.340]   You can do it unattended.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.380]   So once she installed it and gave me permission to,
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.860]   I can get into her system anytime I want.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.460]   Up to eight sessions at a time makes it great for fixing one
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.380]   computer moving to the next, the next, the next running
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.100]   scan or anti-virus.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.220]   You can-- oh, this is great.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.100]   This is so handy.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.060]   I can drag a file.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.180]   Let's say I have malware bytes or some tool
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.660]   that I need to put on their system.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.380]   It's on my desktop.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.020]   I just drag it to their desktop.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.060]   And then I can run it on their system.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.660]   That's just really a fantastic product.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.260]   I want you to try it free.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.500]   They do have day passes for people who do occasional support.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.540]   But really, this is for the professional.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.260]   Go to go to assist.com/twig.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.660]   And you'll get 30 days free.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:59.300]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.020]   This is a great product.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.100]   I highly recommend it.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.900]   I've been using it for years.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.660]   And if you're in the support business,
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.500]   we'll make you a hero.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.020]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:15.060]   So what was the third acquisition, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.620]   I was wrong.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.180]   I was wrong.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.540]   The point was not that.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.900]   It was remailed from a few weeks ago.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.100]   But--
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.900]   Well, they did buy that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.460]   They did.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.300]   The news on it is that they made the remail software open source.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.900]   You can't imagine Apple's happy with.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.860]   So remail, by the way, which I think Apple knocked off the store.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.360]   Didn't they?
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.340]   I think it's gone.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.100]   I think Google removed it from the app store.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:36.900]   Google did it.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.400]   OK.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.700]   So remail was a great program, which
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.180]   I used to download your entire Gmail database,
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.380]   everything onto your phone.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.740]   And since your phone has some memory,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.260]   everything's there.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.820]   And searchable.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.500]   Google said that they didn't really want that capability.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.420]   They liked the search heuristics or something like that.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.860]   Another engineering acquisition.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.340]   I mean, this seems like they just really wanted the developer.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.380]   I mean, why would they-- I mean, they pull the app from the app
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.540]   store, and then they open source the code, which
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.460]   how many iPhone apps do you know are open source?
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.340]   I didn't even think that the terms of your agreement
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.380]   as an Apple developer that you could do that.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:12.580]   But I--
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.860]   I bet you that's why--
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.700]   I bet you that's why they pulled it off.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.260]   Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:17.780]   OK.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.420]   OK.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.900]   So they pull it off the app store.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.620]   They open source the code.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.340]   And the developer basically says, hey,
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.420]   I would love to see this code as the basis of new iPhone
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.140]   apps that do cool stuff with your email.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.140]   Grab the code.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.940]   And don't worry about having to do all the work,
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.140]   or grabbing the mail, and having it all local database.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.740]   I've done that work for you, so you can make some new cool apps.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.060]   So I think that's awesome.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.100]   I hope some developers do grab that code.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.420]   If I cared about developing for the iPhone,
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.340]   I would be certainly poking through it.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.380]   But interesting, it sounds like they-- I mean, to me,
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.900]   that sounds like they just wanted the engineer.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.940]   And the engineer himself, Gabor, was a--
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.980]   he was an intern in Gmail's engineering department.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.180]   And he left, and then he created this iPhone app.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.740]   And now he's back.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.580]   It was a great revolving door, isn't it?
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.620]   It must feel good, though, to be an intern and then
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.380]   get the job based on what you did.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.340]   That's awesome.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.900]   That is kind of fantastic.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.420]   He's a really responsive developer, too.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.020]   So good luck to him.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.860]   You know, I just found my database was so huge
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.820]   that it took a long time, even over Wi-Fi,
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.140]   to get the Gmail database.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.620]   It took forever.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.460]   So it does some fancy compression stuff, right?
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.220]   I mean, if that--
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.700]   Yeah, it took gigabytes and made it at megabytes.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.260]   That's awesome.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.540]   Yeah, hundreds of megabytes, but still megabytes.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.580]   No, I liked it.
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.340]   I guess I still have it, right?
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.740]   I mean, you can't--
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.580]   Is this the beginning of the solution of the offline email
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.740]   for Chrome OS?
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.580]   Ah, maybe.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.140]   That's what it sounds like to me.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.700]   Historically, I think about Jaiku, for instance, where you'd
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.520]   say, oh, well, they hired Yuri and Petri to do a Twitter
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.260]   clone, no?
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.940]   Or they hired them to do this or that.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.580]   And historically, it seems like they just
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.780]   hire the talent not necessarily to do the same thing.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.300]   Yeah, it looks like, do I still have it?
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.300]   Maybe not.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.460]   They can't pull it off my phone, can they?
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.020]   So I imagine this fancy compression magic
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.220]   is available in the code, I mean, in the code which
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.340]   is out there and published.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.020]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.500]   Well, I'm sure they're just doing like,
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.500]   limples of or something.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.660]   You think there's something better than that?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.420]   I mean, it's just text.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:24.820]   Right.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.740]   Google doesn't compress it at all in theory, right?
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.260]   They just leave it the way it is.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.780]   Right, right.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.220]   But how does it handle like attachments?
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.180]   It didn't pull attachments.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.060]   It only pulls it away.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.460]   Oh, OK, so it was just text.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.820]   OK, OK.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.420]   So this was an engineer acquisition then.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.820]   This was just your smart.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.500]   We like you.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.060]   Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he was using limples.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.540]   If why would you try--
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.780]   I mean, how would you come up with something better?
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.380]   If you did, that's much more important than re-mailing.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.980]   Right.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:54.380]   Hey, speaking of developments, good news for swipe users.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.460]   Thank you, Gina, perhaps.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.460]   Thank you, Gina.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.060]   Thank you.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.980]   Nice job, Gina.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.980]   I don't know if I had anything to do with this.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.220]   Of course you did.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.820]   I mean, the CEO emailed me and said, hey, maybe let's chat.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.700]   And I didn't get the chance to talk to him before the show
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.580]   today.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.780]   So the swipe team released a limited Android beta.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.300]   So you can go to swipe.com.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.100]   You can sign up for the beta, and you can download Swipe.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.460]   They send you an email first.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:22.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.660]   And then you have to--
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.020]   then it's complicated.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.780]   But it didn't seem like it was automatic and instant.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.060]   It wasn't like I had to get approved or anything.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.260]   So now, like, a week ago, they're saying,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.900]   do not use the leaked unauthorized version of Swipe.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.620]   And that's not even our business model.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.860]   We're not even going to offer it in the market.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.860]   We're just going to--
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.620]   OEM licensing is our business model.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.820]   And this week, they have this limited beta.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.140]   So in a way, hey, that's great.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.060]   I'm glad for the swipe team.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.380]   It sounds like they learned-- it sounds like they realized
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.260]   that user feedback is a good thing.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760]   People who like it.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.700]   That's an asset.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.060]   It's an asset, yes.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.300]   But it is not clear whether or not Swipe is going
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.400]   to be available in the market.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.880]   I can't tell if this beta is just to get feedback
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.260]   to help them with--
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:04.660]   Or shut you off.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   --or shut you off.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.140]   Or shut me off.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.020]   They say very clearly when you install it,
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.640]   now there are some features missing
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.440]   that we can only do on OEM phones.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.500]   So I think it's a freemium thing.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.920]   Is the annoying beta--
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.080]   this does resolution is an--
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.920]   Yeah, that's gone.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.380]   I think that doesn't do that anymore.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.640]   It just works.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.560]   Was that a new business model they stumble into,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.860]   which has released the freemium model and create
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.820]   consumer demand to sell it for you to the phone companies?
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.700]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.940]   And it looks beautiful.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.580]   It looks better than the beta did, right, Gina?
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.420]   I mean, it's really nice.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.700]   I have not installed it.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.220]   I switched to Shape Writer.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.980]   I was a little annoyed with them with Swipe.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.500]   I got to say, I have to say, I'm really happy that they--
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.420]   I feel like they made the right decision.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.740]   I felt like it was a mistake.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.700]   Their initial response.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.340]   I think that this is great that they're doing the beta.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.320]   I've kind of moved on.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.120]   Oh, man.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120]   Don't cross Gina.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.320]   She's tough.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   How weird.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.480]   I think it's great.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.680]   I think it's great that they did it.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.200]   And I think you should-- if you're-- it just
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.760]   didn't go back to Swipe to try it, go for it.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.320]   But I actually didn't sign up for the beta myself.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.520]   It really works really well.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.840]   Move out the gestures now.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.080]   Yeah, gestures is--
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:13.960]   But I'm still trying to--
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.800]   Yeah, yeah, now.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.400]   I'm going to steal that from my tool.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.760]   But you can talk about it if you want.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.120]   Because Gina tweeted it.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.120]   And that's what-- or buzzed it.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.080]   And that's when I found it.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   So you get credit for it.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.820]   But I was going to be my tool.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.420]   No credit.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.460]   No credit.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.580]   We'll talk about gestures later.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.660]   Yeah, let's talk about it later.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.100]   You can explain why I'm doing it later.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.340]   Please save my tool.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.420]   I won't touch-- I won't touch--
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.800]   I won't touch your tip if you don't touch my tool.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.260]   I wasn't going to say that.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.500]   But you just did it.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.420]   I said it.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:43.900]   I got--
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.420]   I'm blasting.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.300]   I got no pride.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.500]   None at all.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.500]   And none of us are going to go anywhere near Jeff's number.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.380]   Oh, no.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.000]   No, we wouldn't do that.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.340]   So some of the things that Kevin, when we emailed Kevin,
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.480]   he said he'd like to talk about is one of his rants
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.280]   on Life Hacker, why it doesn't pay to be Google's guinea pig.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.880]   Are you Google's guinea pig, Kevin?
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.400]   Well, on the whole, I'm a pretty big user of Google.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.040]   And whatnot.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.320]   I'm running Chrome right now.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.120]   What I wrote about was it built up where things were starting
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.920]   to rub me the wrong way.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.240]   Buzz is-- we've covered Buzz.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.040]   You guys have covered Buzz quite a bit on it.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.760]   Well, I'm still using Buzz.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.200]   Aren't you all still using Buzz?
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.160]   I love Buzz.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.720]   Well, the issue there with instead of doing a closed beta
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.560]   and gathering feedback like Wave, which was a really--
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.200]   I think Gina would agree, is a pretty good way
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.360]   of launching a product, getting the right minds on it,
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.880]   and using that feedback, and then slowly rolling it out
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.320]   to people, whereas Buzz just all of a sudden, one day,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.600]   logged into your email, and there it was.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.800]   And with-- without enough--
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   fickle, somewhat problematic, some would say, privacy settings.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.440]   And I wrote about a few other things
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.720]   that I thought that Google's launch and then iterate
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.080]   method, which I usually works pretty well for a lot
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.880]   of their products.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.560]   I really felt it and served them well, which is basically
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.160]   Android and leaving a lot of cell phone users kind of unknowing
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.200]   as to whether they're ever going to get an upgrade,
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.040]   what kind of upgrade they're going to get.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.600]   That's good.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.920]   And also, Buzz and alienating some people from the launch,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.960]   but then a commenter actually pointed out to me
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.080]   that one of the ones I was kind of like forehead smacking
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.320]   and missing was Google Gears, which now--
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.040]   I don't think most people are dependent on Google Gears,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.120]   but if you liked offline Gmail, I love offline synced Google Docs.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.720]   And even at Life Hacker, some of our editing software
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.160]   uses Google Gears in the background.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.280]   But now, Google Gears, I really think
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.720]   is only available basically on Chrome on Windows,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   unless you hack it together in Firefox on Windows.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.840]   And it might not be available even there.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.320]   Right.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.440]   Yeah, they've said that they're going to let
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.160]   the sunset on Google Gears and transition to HTML5.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.240]   In the meantime, everyone who was an early adopter of Gears
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.960]   and was into it, and even based on their functionality
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.000]   around it now, are pretty much left in the dust.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   And they haven't really said anything about stop
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.720]   gap measures for Gears or anything like that.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.240]   Right.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.720]   And my main complaint was that there
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   are certain things you have to release like a product.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.440]   And there are other things--
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:39.960]   Come on.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.640]   They're giving this stuff to you for free.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.320]   Come on.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.000]   That's true.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.600]   It's like that lady who was getting the free Wi-Fi
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.440]   a bitch when the guy moved.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   That was great.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   That was a great question.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.880]   Well, with your Android phone, though, I mean--
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.480]   With my G1, which is eyeballed--
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.400]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.560]   You bought the G1 with the feature set it came with, right?
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.760]   I did.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.320]   And so you're mad that--
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.120]   So if you bought a razor, it's still
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.360]   the same razor today as it was then.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.720]   I think the expectation that you're
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.360]   going to get something else is not--
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.800]   Certainly, the Toyota is updated less often
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.280]   than these things that updates are good.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:13.780]   Sure.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.720]   But Android is an open source operating system.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.440]   I bought it because it has this ray of sunshine on it
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.880]   from being open source and backed by Google.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.320]   And--
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.200]   Well, the issue there is not that you're
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:24.720]   the guinea pig.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.200]   The issue there is that they didn't
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.680]   make it updateable, the phone updateable enough.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.080]   It was such a crappy phone you couldn't update it.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.680]   Well, the G1 in that case, that is true.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.080]   They didn't put enough memory on it
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.960]   to allow for over the air upgrades.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.800]   That's why I didn't buy it because it was--
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.280]   Sure.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.640]   Actually, I did buy it, but it's why I didn't use it.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.040]   Because it was just-- it was clearly too slow.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.680]   Leo, can you give us a tour of your electronic graveyard
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.180]   someday?
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.400]   It's all behind me here.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:50.880]   Everything.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.040]   Look, I got an Asus EPC, the first one
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.720]   seven inch screen, unusable.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.320]   There's the first iPod, five gigabytes, usable,
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.000]   but it's too small now.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.520]   There's a Newton back there somewhere.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.280]   I get it all here.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.720]   It's a museum.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.360]   And the G1 is back here, too.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:05.920]   But--
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.280]   And there's the HTC Hero, which is on--
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.920]   I think that's 1.5 now.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.880]   And then the two more than--
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.040]   --frestrating.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.320]   I touch it made to 1.6.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.840]   The Droid is 2.0.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.320]   The Nexus 1 is 2.1.1.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.480]   And now Android and Mi Blog has said
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.680]   that they've heard or they have sources
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.080]   saying that every phone is going to make it up to Android 2.1.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.520]   And so you know that there are upgrades coming,
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.160]   and you know it's not entirely Google's fault.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:33.880]   It actually isn't.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.160]   It's the carriers and the hardware makers
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.360]   are at some point to blame for not getting
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.760]   their phones up to 2.1.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.560]   But what does everyone know Android phones as?
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.600]   They're the Google phones.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.120]   And I really think it hurts Google's brand
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.280]   when they're leaving phones that could be--
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.600]   I guess my key is the phones that could be updated,
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.400]   that don't get updated, I think that's frustrating.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.560]   Yeah, I agree there, but I don't think that's a problem.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.400]   I wouldn't want to discourage Google from continuing its beta
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.000]   philosophy about as I start to write a book about that.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.320]   But what's that going to be called?
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.600]   Oh, beta.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.720]   Oh, I like that.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.560]   That's really great.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.360]   In fact, that was one of the complaints people
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.960]   had that they just didn't put the label beta on Buzz.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.880]   Exactly.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.760]   All they had to do was put the label.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.440]   The point of beta is that it brings us up in the design chain
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.280]   and lets us have more of a voice in what the product is
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.680]   going to be and do, and that's good.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.160]   So I think that the question becomes--
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:32.640]   your argument's that it becomes matters of how realistic
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.200]   are the expectations you're given,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.120]   or are you led astray by the expectations?
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.240]   And I think that's fair.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.280]   A, and then B, how easy is it to get those updates when they
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.200]   occur, and I think that's also fair.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.440]   But the philosophy of beta and the philosophy of enabling
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.720]   people to put stuff up, to improve the product as it goes,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.960]   I think that's sterling, and I wish other companies would do it.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.120]   I think that's true.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.680]   And that's why I love Google Labs.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.680]   I love the idea of being able to release features.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.600]   And I'm fine with them saying telling me
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.920]   that play with this stuff in Gmail, it may break your Gmail,
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.600]   it may break your add-ons, and let us know what you think about it.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.480]   I think that's a great way to launch products.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.880]   Gmail, Google Reader, Google Maps,
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.040]   I love their labs philosophy on the whole.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.920]   But I think that I wonder if sometimes they don't think
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.000]   about the end user's experience with products
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.920]   where they don't give you that easy in the lab
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.440]   or out of the lab option, like with Buzz,
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.760]   like with Android to a certain extent, and with Google Gears.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.280]   Yeah, I mean, I certainly agree with Jeff,
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.240]   but I also agree with Kevin in that there
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.320]   are risks to being early doctor to Google products.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.440]   They're definitely risks.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.280]   Like Google Apps, the Google Apps versus Google accounts,
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.680]   Google Apps accounts versus Google accounts issue.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.160]   You switch to Google Apps, they're pushing Google Apps,
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.360]   you kind of move your email address, or even Google Voice
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   to some extent, you switch your phone number.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.800]   These are a big deal to change your email or your phone number
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.680]   in, and then you don't quite get what you expect,
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.040]   and it's not clear that things aren't going to roll out
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.240]   as quickly, and it's confusing.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.200]   I mean, I think that advertising the risks clearly
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:10.840]   is important.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.520]   I think they've done really well with Wave.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.440]   I think they didn't do so well with Gmail.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.560]   Gmail was in beta for how many years?
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.320]   Five years?
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   Seven.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.640]   Seven.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.680]   It was seven years.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.240]   OK, so--
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.080]   Yeah, by the way, my favorite Google Labs feature is,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.240]   you could put the beta back in Gmail.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.960]   Oh, god.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.760]   Yeah, so I'm all in favor of beta,
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.120]   but let's be mindful about when the label is on, how long it's
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.560]   on, and be clear about what that means.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:37.840]   So--
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.600]   Yeah, I think you're right, Gene.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.040]   I think there's a question.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.120]   Is a beta baked enough to put it out as one issue?
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.800]   Is it been baked too long?
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.600]   Is another issue?
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.200]   And again, what's the label really
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.600]   bring to your expectations?
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.720]   And you can't just muck with it to make it meaningless?
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.760]   Right, exactly.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.240]   Exactly.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.680]   So Wave is in preview.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.160]   That's like pre-beta.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.000]   And because it was--
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.080]   It's a little bit of an invitation only.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.720]   That made it even more sort of super early adopter,
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.480]   Canary in the coal mine kind of thing.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.920]   I think that that's a really good signal.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.120]   Labs says very clearly, this might break, it might go away.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.240]   We're just trying it out.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.600]   I think that's really clear.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.520]   The Gmail definitely abused the beta label.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.440]   And I just think that Google has to be really clear about--
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.920]   I mean, everybody wants to try new Google products.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.800]   I think they should just be clear about what level.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   Maybe they need a threat level color or something.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.880]   That's a good idea.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.400]   How bad?
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.480]   I almost mentioned Google Voice in that piece.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.400]   And I actually had three paragraphs drafted.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.680]   And then I pulled it out.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.600]   And I even left a note at the end saying, I almost did.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.120]   Because I think with Google Voice,
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.200]   they actually have let--
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.880]   by keeping it invite only.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.320]   And I think they've done a better job with letting people
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.400]   know, hey, if you want to change your number,
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.720]   and if you want to send that email to your entire family
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.320]   saying, this is my new number and whatnot,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.000]   and I will still be really miffed if Google Voice somehow
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.080]   doesn't work out, really miffed.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.240]   But I think that they've done a better job in apps
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.800]   like that of explaining what the risks are to their adopters.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.480]   And I still have my phone number if Google Voice goes down.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.520]   My actual--
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.040]   So the complaint isn't that they try stuff out on us.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.760]   Because we like that.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.920]   The complaint is that they're just
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.440]   not communicating well enough what the risks are.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.080]   Not always.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   Sometimes.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.640]   But not always.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.240]   Not always.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.960]   In some cases, like Wave, they were clear.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.760]   Voice, they were clear.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.360]   But you're right.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.880]   Buzz was a really is a very good example of Google just
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.920]   because it has salted your Gmail inbox.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.840]   And so many people use Gmail in a production environment.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.440]   So introducing something that's clearly
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.840]   beta into a production environment is something
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.560]   that you're not--
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.760]   Oh, that's a good irony.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.840]   Because the only reason they took off the beta label on Gmail
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.640]   was because they were trying to sell it to enterprises.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.600]   Right.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.120]   And then--
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:48.960]   That's a good point.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.560]   They go, here, we'll give you something.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.400]   Let's blow up your inbox.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.800]   And I think that really upset people.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.400]   And I understand why that would upset people.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.480]   And they didn't make it clear enough
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.640]   that you didn't have to turn it on.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.680]   They didn't make it easy enough to turn it off.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.720]   They've addressed some of that, though, right?
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.320]   Yes.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.600]   And I want to complain about my Google Slanket.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.800]   It sheds--
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.480]   A favor come out with one with a pocket.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   You won't be able to upgrade.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.560]   It has a pocket.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.000]   It has a pocket.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.960]   Oh, it does.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.360]   It's the beta blankie.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.560]   I'm sorry, it was the built-in white pocket.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.160]   You know, it would have been great.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.000]   They missed a big bet.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.200]   That says Google on the pocket.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.600]   It would have should have said beta.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.320]   They missed a bet.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.640]   There was a real opportunity there.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.200]   They're famous for the beta.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.520]   You're working, Kevin.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.320]   And I think this is really exciting.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.960]   Just as Gina's done the complete guide to Google Wave,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.440]   you're doing the complete guide to Google Android.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.360]   I am not.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.880]   Are you going to do it the same way
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.000]   like an online book and everything?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.640]   Well, yes.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.160]   I believe--
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.360]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.480]   It says here--
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.320]   Oh, look at you.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.360]   Don't announce this.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.360]   Why'd you put it in there?
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.560]   You don't know me, do you?
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.040]   I just read what's on the paper.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.040]   I've seen how fast you move, and I should have thought--
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.960]   I'll cut that out.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.720]   Maybe I should have done all caps.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.320]   No, I'm actually fine saying that.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.000]   You're OK.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.640]   I can cut that out.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.200]   No, it's fine.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.640]   I'm working on a complete Android guide.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.000]   And I believe it will have similar, if not the same,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.040]   licensing and release as Gina's complete.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.680]   I love that.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.000]   I can't wait to get it.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.080]   Complete guide to Google Wave.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.840]   And if, you know, secrets be known,
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.240]   and Gina might have slightly pushed it by saying, like,
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.600]   gee, who really knows Android?
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.560]   And who on this show might have mentioned really
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.080]   wanting a Android guide?
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.600]   We do.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   We want it.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:33.960]   I want it.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.240]   Who referred to it as the operating system of Easter eggs?
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.360]   I don't remember.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.520]   So this will be a-- actually be a--
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.400]   Oh, that was me.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   That was me.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.000]   Jeff gets credit to that.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.440]   So baked up in Twig and hard worked on in Nights and Weekends.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.840]   And I believe it'll be--
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.320]   I don't have any idea of a release date yet.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.400]   But it's moving along.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.240]   Well, so this is the tease for it.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.000]   This is the tease.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.560]   Which is what you asked for in the first place.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.520]   Someday, coming soon to a computer near you.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.000]   How many people use Android?
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.320]   Do we have any idea how the adoption is on Android?
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.000]   That's a good question.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.800]   What was that last number?
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.120]   Shipping 60,000.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.480]   They said 80,000 Nexus 1s, right?
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.520]   80,000.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.480]   But that's only the next--
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.960]   Now, there was a number on total Android shipments.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.520]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.120]   I think it was 60,000 a day.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.160]   I think that's what I remember, too.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.840]   There was at that rate now.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.520]   A day?
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.560]   Right.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.760]   Does that mean handsets or just people downloading it?
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.960]   What does that mean?
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.160]   I think that's shipped by manufacturers,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   to stores, carriers, et cetera.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.640]   A day?
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.560]   A day?
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.680]   That's a lot.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.120]   That's good.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   What's that versus Apple?
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.360]   Anybody going to be Matthew James?
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:41.960]   Apple's million.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.960]   That's probably right.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.880]   Chat room, anybody?
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.600]   Come on.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.240]   Chat room?
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:46.760]   Chat room?
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.640]   Do I have the ability to harness the chat room or is that like--
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.120]   Yes, you do.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.640]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.880]   The ability is extended.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.680]   No, they're leos.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.280]   All leos.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.840]   You can't use them.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.000]   I give you permission.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.840]   I give you permission to harness the vast power.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.880]   They're open APIs.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.440]   Chat room.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   This is an open API.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.800]   We do need an open API.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.320]   Actually, we're doing that, believe it or not.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.400]   We're going to convert the chat room to XMPP.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.760]   And there will be an open API to our chat room, believe it or not.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.000]   6% of the smartphone market, Apple's is 16%.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.080]   So 6% is not shabby.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.360]   6% is not shabby.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.520]   But 60,000 a day, that sounds very high.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.640]   90,000 a day for the iPhone.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.840]   10 million in 2008 for iPhone says Ms. Emma.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   60,000 a day times 365 days would be what, folks?
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.280]   Oh, come on.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.040]   Now, they don't do math.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.080]   What do you think they are?
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.520]   They're off Ali's sleeves.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.000]   Come on, somebody, come on.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.200]   Assign the math problems.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.720]   What?
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.560]   Kyle knows he's in our audience.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.320]   How many is it, Kyle?
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.600]   He says 60,000 times 365.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.800]   He's got his iPhone out.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.680]   You have to do this on an Android phone.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.080]   2.1, 21.9 million.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080]   That's what we are.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:03.600]   That's what we are.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.240]   Can't be right.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:05.600]   Oh.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.880]   Can't be right.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.480]   However, I think Android penetration
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.800]   has kind of reached that critical mass at this point.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.080]   I'm seeing a lot more Nexus ones than I ever thought.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.000]   I was at a geek launch in Chicago this week with a Neil
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.680]   for expert labs.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.160]   And there were quite a few Nexus ones at the table, many more
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.520]   than I expected.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.200]   So I'll be interested to see what it's like at South
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:26.920]   by Southwest.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.840]   I want to know how many folks will be toting the--
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.760]   I hope it's not taking off yet because I want that spectrum
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.120]   to name it.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.520]   T-Mobile spectrum, is that what we're hoping for?
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.840]   I'm sure Austin--
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.920]   And Verizon in the spring, right?
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   I'm bringing my drawing.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.600]   I'm the 3rd.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.280]   I'm bringing my iPhone, my droid, and my Nexus one.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.880]   I figured one of them was going to work.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.920]   One of them's got to work.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.320]   And you know--
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.600]   And we want to be able to brag that we can actually
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.520]   make a call in Austin.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   Oh.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.360]   [LAUGHING]
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.400]   I am also streaming from South by Southwest via 3G.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.760]   So I'm hoping that the 3G networks are all down.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.280]   We have this box called a life streamer, or a life stream--
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.200]   you stream--
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:10.520]   and we're just loading it to us that has slots for 8 USB--
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.880]   or maybe they're not USB-- but it has 8 3G connections,
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.160]   too, from each of the big four carriers.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.320]   And then if 18T is swamped, it automatically load balances.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.480]   Wow.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.440]   So in theory, I can walk around with this thing.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.160]   It's a 20-pound backpack.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.640]   [LAUGHING]
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.880]   Your brain manly.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.280]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.400]   If you see a guy-- and I have a staff, which contains--
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.480]   has a camera and a microphone on it and a light.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.960]   You're going to have a staff and a robe.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.680]   And it would end up--
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.520]   And I'll be wearing a slank it.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.200]   You're going to have to open the giant backpack.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.160]   I should wear a miter to really complete the look.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.520]   And then--
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.360]   When I was in Vegas this last week,
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.440]   speaking, by the way, to the National Association
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.680]   of Truck Stop Owners--
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   You're kidding.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.320]   That was great.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.040]   That was great.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.800]   I'll always stay on that for one second.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.840]   So my favorite product discovery was caffeinated beef jerky,
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.280]   called, of course, Perky Jerky.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.720]   Perky jerky.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   Nice.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.960]   That must be what Gina is living on.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.800]   Perky Jerky.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.120]   I'm driving geeks, can you eat that?
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.760]   There was another product called Monkey Butch, a soothing
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.520]   powder.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   I want you to--
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.680]   [LAUGHING]
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:23.440]   But anyway, so in Vegas they had 4G--
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:23.920]   what do I want to say?
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.640]   Not Wi-Fi, but--
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.600]   Wi-max?
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:26.920]   Thank you.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.680]   Wi-max.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.960]   And I couldn't get it to work, darn it.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.720]   But I kind of liked the idea that I could say,
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.560]   yeah, to hotel overpriced Wi-Fi.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.080]   Right.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.600]   We used it in Vegas for a CES.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.720]   And it was about the same as 3G.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.200]   It wasn't anything mind-boggling.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.800]   That's what Austin-- if anybody had half a brain,
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.280]   one of those telcos, they should be
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.440]   installed at Austin.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.280]   It's Clearwire, but Sprint does it in Vegas.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.640]   I think Sprint has the Clearwire franchise everywhere else,
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.160]   too.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.080]   So Sprint, if you're listening, Clearwire.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.080]   Fast.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.160]   Fast.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   You got one week.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.120]   What is going to be the breakout application in Austin?
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.360]   In 2007, it was Twitter.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.280]   2008, was it 4-square?
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.080]   It was last year, I think.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.400]   It was 2009, 4-square?
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.840]   What will be the-- I bet Buzz.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.800]   I'm sure Buzz was released--
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.440]   the timing of Buzz's release had something
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.520]   to do with South by Southwest, don't you think?
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:22.280]   I think the snarky geeks of South by Southwest
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   were going to be--
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.000]   They're not going to be--
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.960]   Golwala, maybe?
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.800]   Yeah, it was a Golwala.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.000]   Was he here in Austin?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Oh.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.040]   So they may be-- I think they may have some plans.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.800]   Yeah, that would make sense.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.480]   I'm not going to use it.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   I'm going to use Buzz.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.600]   There's an iPhone app called Buzzy
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.080]   that is really essentially just a repackaging of the mobile.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.240]   But it's a little faster.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.720]   My mobile's broken on my iPhone.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.760]   It won't load.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.000]   I keep seeing the same post from weeks ago.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.440]   I don't understand what's going on.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   So I use Buzzy on the iPhone.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.200]   And I use the-- actually, Maps, to me,
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.800]   is a great Buzz client on the Android platform.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   Let's talk about your top 10 Android picks, actually, Kevin.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.720]   We took a look at those last week.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.880]   Great article on Life Hacker.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.840]   Thank you.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.880]   Sorry.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.560]   Do you go ahead?
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.000]   How did you pick them?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.480]   Oh, well, I'm really the only full-time--
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.360]   Android, excuse me.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.720]   --excuse me, enthusiastic.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.400]   Am I OK here?
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.440]   The video.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.040]   OK, sorry.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.680]   Don't worry about it.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.400]   If you spat on your end, it's good on our end.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.000]   So there's a move.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.560]   Gotcha.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.720]   I guess my editor's kind of left me alone to pick out.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.480]   And I also went to the Life Hacker archives
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.000]   and saw what we'd like before and whatnot.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.880]   And I tried to come up with 10 apps
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.360]   that were both useful, mostly useful, actually.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.000]   And in a few cases, like, Laar just seemed cool
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.520]   and seemed like they were going to get even cooler.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.760]   And Laar, actually, is pretty cool when I walk around.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.560]   Even a place like Buffalo, you can walk around and get, like,
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.920]   you see, like, oh, look, there's a Wikipedia article
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   based on that old architectural building or whatnot.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.680]   Frank Lloyd Wright.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.160]   It really represents yours.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.360]   That helps.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.880]   I will say that since last week, I did move task killer free,
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.600]   which was, I think, at the number three slot.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.280]   I moved that up to number six.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.840]   And I left an update in the post,
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.680]   because I'd been gently schooled by a number
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:23.480]   of really smart Life Hacker readers about task
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.520]   killing on the Android.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.200]   And I know you've mentioned before, Leo,
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.560]   that there have been times when an app has won a--
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   I do it all the time.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.600]   Am I not supposed to do that?
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.840]   No, for that purpose, for apps that just go haywire,
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.760]   or it seems like something is dragging your phone down
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.080]   or doing a huge data push in the background,
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.760]   that's what I think task killer really comes in handy for.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.360]   But in terms of-- I was kind of using it as this placebo
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.640]   effect of, like, ah, ah, ah, ah, and just killing apps.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.600]   Stop running, stop running.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.120]   And thinking it was freeing up memory for me.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:59.520]   But that's a little dangerous to do in terms of phone functionality.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.200]   You never quite know what you're killing.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.640]   And also things like alarm clocks and other services
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.080]   that are supposed to be running the background.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.920]   You can end danger.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.800]   So I think it's still useful for Android users
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.000]   who know that something can occasionally go awry and wrong.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.720]   But yeah, it shouldn't have been such a prominent--
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.400]   Really?
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.080]   I kind of disagree a little bit.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.720]   I mean, you have to use it judiciously.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.120]   And almost all of these killers will allow you to say,
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.880]   don't kill this.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.240]   So if you have an alarm clock that you keep running, which I do--
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.360]   And task killer does have a way.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.440]   You can press it in the setting.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.880]   Open the task killer app and press and hold on an app.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.840]   And you can set it to the ignore list,
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.600]   which means it won't kill it, ever.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.680]   Yeah, I use a different one from the one you use.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.480]   I use something called advanced task killer, which is also free.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.840]   But I do it prophylactically a lot.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.560]   And I haven't had any problems.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.680]   Just because I have had the phone become sluggish,
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.920]   you know what my biggest problem-- and I think we've all
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.320]   observed this-- is that sometimes the keyboard gets
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.280]   either like this-- the digitizer gets completely off.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.120]   So you press--
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.760]   Like this--
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.160]   Like this-- like this-- like this--
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.320]   You press Q and get a space.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.560]   And I don't know what the best way to fix that is.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.400]   It seems some people say just off and on.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.080]   I sleep the display and pop it back on.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.680]   That often can help.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.000]   Yeah, not a full off and on, but just the off button.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.600]   And then this display goes off and you turn it back on.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.240]   I just found that with using task killer and using the widget
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.560]   on the home screen sometimes, it was too entropic for me
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.480]   to figure out, well, why isn't it
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.760]   remember the milk syncing anymore?
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:36.400]   Or why is the music now not responding to my head
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.840]   for buttons or something?
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.040]   Because there's little tasks that are running all the time
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.200]   you don't want to kill.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.160]   And maybe you've got a really good setup with everything
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.080]   properly ignored.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.520]   But it's still useful.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.440]   But the other apps on the list, I think,
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.520]   are just really good.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.960]   Either utilities or just kind of cool apps
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.840]   that really make you glad you have
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.160]   this little tiny, basically, computer in your hand
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   or in your pocket.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.720]   All right, I have to look it up and tropic.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.160]   Black or predictability just for people who are like me here.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.400]   It's a physics thing showing off.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.360]   But you show it.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.120]   Because if you know that word, I'm very impressed.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.120]   Hey, this is a great show for vocabulary.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.200]   We were there at Penurias a couple of weeks ago.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.480]   Now we know in tropic.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.840]   CS113, actually.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.960]   That was a computer science call back against.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.280]   Did you study at RIT?
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.640]   Where'd you go to--
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.000]   Oh, no, I wish.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.520]   They wouldn't let me in.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.200]   I went to University of Buffalo, UB.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.800]   UB.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.120]   And what is the mascot of the University of Buffalo?
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.280]   The bowl.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.960]   Of course, because if it were a buffalo,
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.520]   it would be confusing.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:41.800]   Right.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.960]   It's Victor E. Period bowl.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:45.800]   A bowl.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.680]   It's only been a Division 118 for a few years.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.440]   You live in a town named Buffalo, but you've got a bowl.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.880]   Well, yeah, there are no actually buffalo in Buffalo.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.400]   Oh.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.360]   It comes from French for Beauflo, beautiful river.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.960]   Oh, you kidding?
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   Or the buffalo in Buffalo have wings.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.920]   Right.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.640]   Those are wings that fly.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.600]   Flow beautifully.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:15.040]   Yes, this is all accurate history of Buffalo.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   Let's take a break.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:16.840]   I want to talk-- we said we would,
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.800]   and I want to talk very much about HTC and the lawsuits,
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.440]   which seems like Google dodged a bullet there with Apple.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.320]   [GRUNTING]
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.800]   Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.920]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.120]   But first, I do want to remind you to back up.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.000]   Always be backing up.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.200]   That it wasn't that-- that's the famous saying from Glenn
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.040]   Gary Glenn Ross.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.120]   Always be backing up.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.360]   If you have a hard drive, it will die.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.960]   If you have data, you will lose it unless you back it up.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.840]   If you have a laptop-- you know, with a number of laptops,
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:53.080]   I get lost or stolen every years, and the hundreds of thousands.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.560]   It's just crazy.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.200]   I get so many calls from people who
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.440]   have lost their precious family photos, their financial documents,
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:50:59.800]   whatever.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:00.480]   Back it up.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.200]   And the best way to do it-- automatic off-site carbonite.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.080]   Just remember that automatic off-site carbonite.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:12.200]   Carbonite encrypts your data using AES-256 bit,
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.480]   sends it up via SSL, so you're very secure.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.080]   And as it makes that data available, not only with an iPhone app,
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.160]   but I'm going to talk a minute.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.200]   In fact, last time I met with the CEO,
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.080]   I said Android app.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.320]   This would be a good Android app.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.960]   So I understand they might be working on one.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.880]   You can check the data from your phone.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.120]   You can check it from any computer.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.720]   You can get any file.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.360]   If you want to move your data from one computer another,
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.080]   you just move the account, restore the data.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   It's all there.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.400]   Now, of course, you have to have broadband.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.640]   And if you have gigabytes of data,
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.040]   it takes a while for that first backup.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.920]   But then afterwards, it's always updating every time
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.520]   a file's changed, so you never are caught with your pants down
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.400]   or something.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.080]   Go to carbonite.com and try it free right now.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.760]   The offer code is Twig--

[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.280]   Offer code is Twig, T-W-I-G.

[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.560]   And if you decide to buy after the free trial--
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.000]   and I really want you to do the free trial,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.280]   make sure it's right for you--
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.800]   then it's two months free.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.600]   Less than $5 a month for unlimited backup.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.680]   Carbonite, backup, done right.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:16.120]   Offer code, this week in Google, Twig.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.200]   All right, let us talk now about the eight.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.280]   You had a, I think, a pithy response to the HTC lawsuits
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:24.880]   by Apple.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.800]   Jeff Jarvis, it was--
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   [PFF]
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   [PFF]
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   [PFF]
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   [PFF]
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   [PFF]
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.960]   I'll lead off.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   I'm mad at Apple.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.640]   What the hell?
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.640]   Compete.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   Compete.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.960]   Don't litigate.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.720]   Innovate.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.480]   Don't litigate.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.480]   It seems like litigation.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.520]   I understand they have a right to protect their patents.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.000]   And I'm not denying their right to do so.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.840]   But is it really the best thing for the world?
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.640]   Or even for Apple?
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   [PFF]
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.640]   [PFF]
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.640]   [PFF]
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   [PFF]
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   [PFF]
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.720]   You know, at one point, here you got me Apple fanboy and I got my iPhone and I love my iPhone
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.880]   and you all corrupted me and made me carry the Nexus One.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:02.880]   [PFF]
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.880]   [PFF]
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.880]   He made you do it.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.880]   [PFF]
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   [PFF]
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.880]   [PFF]
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.880]   [PFF]
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.800]   they say I do whatever jeanus says, I do.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.280]   - It's the slanket. - Is the slanket.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.300]   It's the slanket.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:24.400]   But yeah it makes me say, here's the conundrum I get into.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.440]   I wanna say FU Apple and Stop using Apple products
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.800]   isn't that enough, but of course I'm not going to
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.840]   because I love Apple products.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.700]   What am I gonna do?
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:34.080]   Use windows? - Right.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.200]   - But it's really irritating in terms of the bad
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.200]   citizenship that it shows when you pull these things.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.600]   - They're not alone, in fact the New York Times
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   Bitz blog had a great chart of who's suing whom in mobile.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.920]   And it's just a mess.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.480]   I mean Apple's suing Nokia, Nokia's suing Apple.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:00.400]   Kodak's suing Apple, Apple's suing HTC.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.600]   Research in motion is suing Sharpen Motorola.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.520]   Sharpen's suing LG Group who's also suing Kodak
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.960]   who's suing Sharp, Apple's suing Samsung,
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.560]   Nokia's suing Samsung, Nokia's suing LG Group
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.200]   Toshiba Hitachi, Qualcomm's suing Nokia
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.880]   who's suing them back.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.440]   It's a mess.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.360]   And this is not good for anybody.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.280]   I mean, especially Apple, I'd hope for more from Apple.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.680]   I mean what's the best way for Apple to respond?
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.320]   If they feel that HTC has violated their patents,
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.720]   by the time this has settled those patents will be
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.080]   meaningless anyway, just move on, make something even better.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.800]   - And they run the gamut too, the 20 patents
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.960]   that they're filing, they run the gamut
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.320]   from very specific things that I don't quite get,
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.160]   like GSM signal processing and that type of thing.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.880]   And then also, but then things like slide to unlock
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.160]   on the iPhone, like just moving your thumb left or right.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:58.960]   - They claim that the gesture we have on Android,
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.120]   which is you unlock an iPhone with a number
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:07.000]   and then a slide, oh I see, later than you get the slide.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.480]   That's what they're saying, that slide to unlock thing.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.560]   - Yeah, that and then also the user state awareness,
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.400]   which means that I'm talking on my phone
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.320]   and it knows that it's against my ear
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.920]   and then I'm putting my phone down
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.840]   so it knows I want the screen back on.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.160]   They're saying that that's patented
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.200]   and they have a really goofy patent illustration with it too.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.200]   - Yeah.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.320]   - Was there was multi-touch in there?
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.640]   - Oh yeah.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.480]   - Yeah.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.280]   - This is the one, this is scary one actually.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.840]   Well, this is the one, I wonder if this,
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.640]   I mean, the risk that, and one of the reasons
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.360]   I think they suit on 20 patents
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.360]   is because there's a significant risk
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.200]   of some of these will just be overturned, right?
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   - Yeah, you're already planning on the complaint
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.040]   against the patent.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.600]   - The patent, I mean, I think that there's no merit
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.440]   in the multi-touch patent, for instance.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.680]   There's demonstrably a prior art in multi-touch.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.520]   - Yes.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.360]   - So it's a weak patent to begin with,
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.760]   they shouldn't have gotten in the first place
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.520]   and the risk of suing is that the patent itself gets lost,
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.640]   right, or maybe not.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.160]   - We need an attorney, did I ever say that before in life?
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.200]   - Yeah, we need an attorney.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.800]   - The other question I asked,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.560]   and I didn't get the full answer,
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.480]   but what is, you know, Apple's hypocrisy here,
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:19.360]   as I remember the story, Xerox sued Apple but too late,
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.240]   'cause Apple stole the mouse and stole the GUI
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.360]   from elsewhere.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.200]   - Right.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.960]   - So, but what would, let's say Xerox had sued.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:33.800]   - Would that have saved anybody anything?
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.600]   - No, that's why I think the fact that they didn't
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.160]   for all those years was a smart thing,
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.800]   and, you know, yes, they didn't exploit their own inventions,
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.920]   that's their own damn fault, but they added to the world,
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.600]   they remain legendary to this day
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.000]   and have a little more credit and creativity as a result
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.080]   than they necessarily deserve for their actual actions.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:50.920]   And you know--
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.600]   - Isn't that the risk to Apple is that they could do
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.840]   a lot of PR damage?
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.920]   What if they succeed?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.520]   They went to the ITC and said,
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.680]   we want you to stop in all importation of HTC phones
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.040]   into the US.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.000]   - How many PR would pick at Apple Store?
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.840]   - Yeah, what if they succeed?
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.960]   And then you just can't get it.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.960]   HTC makes the best phones out there, period.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.240]   Not just, you know, Google based,
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.040]   but also Windows Mobile based.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.040]   They're fantastic phones.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.920]   - I have this vision, Leo, of you standing in front
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.040]   of an Apple Store with video camera on you
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.160]   and a blankie on you as you smash your iPhone
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.280]   into the ground and protest and try to set it on fire.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.200]   - Right, so it's bad for Apple.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.280]   - Yeah.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.840]   - Because potentially the PR, I mean, if they succeed
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.320]   and you know, the ITC says,
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:43.000]   nope, that's it, no more containers of HTC phones
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.720]   out of this country.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.600]   - Ooh, that's gonna be painful.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.920]   That's gonna be--
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.760]   - I agree with you.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.360]   And I think that at some point,
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.680]   Apple does risk something here.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.680]   We put up with their control freaky ways
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.480]   because they're so good.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.840]   But, you know, it's like the links in Marley's chain,
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.040]   there's a lot of history here with control freakishness.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:07.520]   And when it starts affecting others outside of Apple
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.720]   and it's a nia nia, you can't have that
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.600]   'cause I wanna be mean to Google.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.760]   The other thing to hear of course is
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   they didn't have the guts editing myself to sue Google.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.160]   - Right, that's the interesting thing
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.400]   because after all the multi-touch stuff,
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.000]   especially as a Google, maybe they will.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.280]   Maybe Monday they'll sue Google, I don't know.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   I think Jeff tries to-- - That was a cool combination.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.440]   - I'm sorry, I thought Jeff, you're right too in that.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.360]   Previously, it's been, what have been the big Apple things
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.400]   that have been focused on the App Store
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.440]   and what, you know, could you get Google Voice on your iPhone?
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.320]   And that's pretty abstract for the average iPhone loving,
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.280]   you know, MacBook toting user.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.360]   But when you start reaching into people's pockets
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   and saying what, you know, that, hey,
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.760]   give me back that phone, or give me back that multi-touch
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.120]   and that slide on lock, I think that will carry
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.680]   much, they'll reach a larger audience,
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.680]   that kind of negative message.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.120]   - Well, it'll reach just that far exactly.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.920]   Is that imagine a successful court case
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:07.080]   in which the court orders Google HTC at all
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:11.240]   to disable functions because Apple won the case.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.520]   - The jailbreak community be a thrilled.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.360]   - Yeah.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.200]   - For the rooting community,
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.320]   imagine that we all get this really crippled Android phone
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.800]   and then have to install a custom ROM
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.640]   and get all the stuff back.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.480]   - And Google will understand that.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.640]   - We go, "Google will say, 'Is that not us?'
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.080]   - Well, how much of this was brought on by Google
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.200]   putting multi-touch into its apps, do you think?
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:31.920]   I mean, was that what the precipitating act?
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:33.400]   - You would assume they had this lawsuit
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.760]   in the works for a while before,
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.040]   and Nexus just got his multi-touch, so.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.280]   It seems like this has been building for a little while.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.720]   - Leo, that was your scoop that the reason
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.000]   we didn't get multi-touch at first was that Apple's request
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.840]   to Google and that's when they were still
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.800]   talking on the playground.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.640]   - Right.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.800]   And the contention of the anonymous person
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.320]   who emailed me on this was that Apple requested
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.560]   of Google because they didn't want to sue,
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.280]   that they knew that if Google did put multi-touch in,
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.920]   they would have to defend their patent
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.040]   and their concern was that the patent wasn't defensible
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.640]   and it could all come tumbling down.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.200]   Of course, by throwing 19 other patents in there,
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   kind of obscure.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.720]   Truth is, I did not see the multi-touch in there.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.880]   I'm just assuming that multi-touch is in there.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.240]   Ours had a list of 10 of them,
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.600]   none of which included multi-touch,
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.960]   but I haven't seen all 20.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.120]   - I think the swear was in there.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.960]   - You'd think it would be.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.120]   I mean, if they didn't, that would be telling.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.000]   And of course, the New York Times blog post goes on to say
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.960]   that one of the reasons these patent lawsuits,
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.080]   there's Nick Bilton writing in The Times this week said,
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.280]   one of the reasons these lawsuits have exploded
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.760]   in the past patent lawsuits really would be about
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.360]   kind of licensing and okay, we'll settle this,
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.520]   we'll license it.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.000]   But patent trolling by companies who bought patents
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.840]   and sued just to make money has really made this
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.320]   a much more vicious fight.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.520]   And you kind of think that Apple's not just trying
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.120]   to get money here.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.040]   And I don't even think Apple's trying to get licensing fees.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.000]   I would guess that Apple wants to,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.640]   this is anti-competitive on Apple's part.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.480]   - Yeah.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.800]   - I mean, that's what it feels like.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.920]   - What they don't want is another big Verizon Droid launch
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.840]   where someone's gonna come out of the gate,
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.760]   partner up with Google and say,
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.360]   come out with this two month campaign
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.760]   where they basically pick on the iPhone.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.600]   - Right.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.360]   - I think it, maybe it's a little bit of a shock
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.720]   and awe type tactic to let carriers and manufacturers know
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.960]   like, hey, don't think you can just come out and say,
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.760]   oh, we do everything the iPhone does.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.720]   Maybe.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.680]   - None of them, okay.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.760]   - And they all correct myself according to--
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.280]   - Engage it.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   - I guess Moto.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.600]   - Okay.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.240]   - Right, notably among the patents,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.200]   nothing, anything pertaining to multi-touch.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.600]   - Yeah. - I'm wrong.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.560]   - Yeah.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.240]   - Yeah, and gadget has a very,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.520]   somebody in the chat room has sent me a link
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.080]   to the excellent and gadget article,
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.560]   Apple versus HTC, a patent breakdown,
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.440]   which is a good name, Niele Patel.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.960]   And he says, yeah, of note,
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.480]   most of the patents were granted in the past year,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.320]   but overall they span a range of 1995 to February 2nd.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.920]   And most of the patents are dry and technical
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.960]   and none of them cover anything like pinch to zoom.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.440]   - Mm.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:20.280]   - So maybe that, maybe that, maybe Apple is kind of
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.120]   gun shy about that.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.440]   - So they go after boring stuff,
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.600]   they go after a manufacturer,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.800]   they don't go after Google,
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.680]   but they end up going after Google.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.040]   Is this the shot across the bow?
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.360]   - It's a weird indirection,
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.840]   'cause yeah, I mean, clearly these are anti-Android.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.280]   It's an anti-Android lawsuit,
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.600]   but it's not an anti-Google, I don't understand.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   - Because Palm has multi-touch too,
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.520]   isn't that been an issue as well?
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.960]   - Yeah, and they're not sewing a Palm?
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.800]   - Yeah.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.560]   - Well, we'll find out, maybe next week of--
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.440]   - Our patent system just to sew.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.680]   - That's what's really wrong.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.520]   - That's not--
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.880]   - It's just broken, it's just broken,
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.560]   and it's getting worse.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:03.120]   - Any other stories we would like to cover
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.120]   before I move on to our tip tool?
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.240]   - Oh, that's the only one you were gonna talk about,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.640]   gesture?
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.480]   - Well, that's gonna be my--
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.160]   - Oh, I'm not sure, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.360]   - That's my tool, right?
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.200]   - That's my tool, right?
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.040]   - Up there.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:15.880]   - Yes, Gina?
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.880]   - Can we quote the onion article a little bit?
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.640]   'Cause that made me laugh so hard today
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.080]   when I saw it on Friend Feed.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:23.920]   - Please do.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.280]   - Oh my God. - Please do.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.600]   - Wait, let me have to, sorry, I have to,
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.960]   on it down here, there are just so many choice quotes.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.400]   Especially after I said that Schmidt freaks me out last week,
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.160]   which I felt a little bad about after the fact.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.320]   - Well, he freaks me out, so I'll say that too.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.200]   - You'll say that too, okay, good, good.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.040]   - And he's only--
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:41.880]   - Don't forget, it's after I said that.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.440]   'Cause he's only getting paid a dollar, so it's okay.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.440]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.040]   - Oh, so never mind, I didn't say anything.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.320]   - Jeez. - Nothing, nothing, I say nothing.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.160]   I mean nothing.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.280]   - I don't need to say it's safe around you,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.080]   you are the club to make it.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.320]   (laughing)
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.160]   - If you had--
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.040]   - I sweat and I struggle to find one silly number.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:02.880]   - What number?
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.360]   I didn't say a number, no number, no number.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.760]   - I've been gone, out, out.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.560]   - No number, nothing.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.400]   - So, I'm gonna--
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.800]   - Google responds to privacy concerns.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.120]   - Yes.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.840]   - A dramatic reading by Gina Tarpani.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.840]   (laughing)
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.960]   - Responding to recent public outcry
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.600]   is over its handling of private data,
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.160]   Search Giant Google offered a wide ranging
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.240]   and eerily well-informed apology
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.040]   to its millions of users on Monday.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.960]   We would like to extend our deepest apologies
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.640]   to each and every one of you announced CEO Eric Schmidt
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.920]   speaking from the company's Googleplex headquarters.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.640]   Clearly there have been some privacy concerns as of late
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.320]   and judging by some of the search terms we've seen,
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.400]   along with the tens of thousands of personal email exchanges
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.120]   and Google chat conversations we've carefully examined.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.920]   It looks as though it might be a while
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.520]   before we regain your trust.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.720]   Adid Schmidt, whether you're Michael Paulson,
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.360]   who lives at 3425 Longview Terrace
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.280]   and makes $86,400 a year,
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.840]   or Jessica Goldblatt from Linwood, Washington,
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.080]   who already has well-established trust issues,
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.920]   we at Google would just like to say
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.720]   how very truly sorry we are.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.480]   The image is great, so they have a Google Maps image
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.360]   and it says, for instance,
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.600]   gives an address in Staten Island.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.800]   Apologies to the Tobs,
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.920]   whose kids are a little too old to be bathed together.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   Apologies to Amanda Byrne, we both know why.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.480]   Please forgive us, Keith Tomkins,
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.920]   the way you forgave Rebecca,
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.360]   even though she rubbed it in your face.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.600]   (laughing)
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.680]   I mean, there are just so many good gems.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.040]   You gotta, it must read the whole thing.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.640]   It's really good, it's really good.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.160]   Schmidt apologized to users,
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.320]   particularly the 1,237,948
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.400]   who take daily medication for anxiety.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.880]   (laughing)
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.240]   For causing any unnecessary distress.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.480]   (laughing)
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.680]   I mean, yeah, there are just some really good lines about,
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.560]   yeah, I must read the article,
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.000]   but yeah, laughed out loud in my office today,
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.880]   so thank you Leo for--
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.600]   - And I don't put that in there,
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.920]   I don't know how, oh well, you know who got in there
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.160]   is a dame, but you know,
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.520]   there is a link on there to an earlier video
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.280]   from the Onion News Network
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.120]   on the Google Optout feature.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.040]   Have you ever seen that?
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.680]   Let me play a little bit,
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.640]   just a little bit of this video.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.720]   I love the Onion News Network
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.720]   'cause it really feels like an actual news story.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.480]   - I'm concerned about your privacy while using Google.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.680]   The internet giant says it understands.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.480]   Google is now offering users a chance to opt out
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.080]   and live in privacy in a remote mountain village.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.280]   Tech Friends reporter Jeff Tate has more.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.320]   - Thanks Teresa, they call it the opt out village
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.560]   and it's just what you'd expect from Google.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.520]   - If you wanna keep your information private,
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.520]   all you have to do is move to our 22 acre opt out village
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.240]   and not speak to anyone from the outside world,
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.240]   it's very simple.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.800]   - Just go to the Google front page,
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.240]   click the opt out button,
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.080]   and in minutes, a van will come to your house and pick you up.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.480]   That same day, a team of Google privacy experts
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.680]   eliminates your home address,
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.320]   guaranteeing it will no longer appear on Google local pages.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.440]   And after just two days in the back of a van, you're there.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.320]   - In the village, we can guarantee that there's no chance
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.440]   of Google reading your emails
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.640]   because there are no computers.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.240]   And because they're also monitored and tracked by Google,
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.960]   there are no banks or hospitals.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.320]   - Residents will be expected to know how to grow food,
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.720]   suture wounds, and bury courses by hand.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.000]   (laughing)
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.040]   - You get the idea.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.080]   Well, we're going to that page
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:31.080]   and seeing both the article and the apology and the video.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.280]   Google's just ripe for this kind of joke, I'm afraid.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.440]   - Yeah, they deserve it.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.600]   (laughing)
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.440]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.520]   - They've earned it.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.480]   - You've mentioned that they must have got fawed
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.720]   up in the Googleplex over that one.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.160]   - Oh yeah. - They had to.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.840]   - Yeah, that's wonderful.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.240]   Now, you don't have to participate, Kevin,
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.320]   unless you want to...
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.160]   Yes?
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.000]   - Oh, you got one?
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:54.840]   - No, no, I have one.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.680]   I'll wait till the...
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.520]   - You can do it.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.600]   - It's not that it'll not be one.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.520]   - We'll get you go last.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.360]   - Okay.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.200]   - What are you talking about?
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.680]   Maybe we better start with Jeff's numbers
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.720]   so nobody preempts him.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.360]   - No big deal, but, and I don't understand this story,
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.440]   actually, which I'll rarely admit, but I will this time.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.160]   - It's from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.560]   - Wall Street Journal, Google's top three executives,
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.360]   Bryn Page and Schmidt, took $1 in compensation
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.040]   for the last year, did not receive bonuses,
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.080]   took no stock.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:22.920]   - That's bizarre.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.720]   - That usually is the case when a company's messing up
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.640]   and it's horrible, but their stock gained 85% last year.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.560]   - Yeah, why would they not take money?
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.640]   - I don't get it.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.160]   It's like, who are they, Craig Newmark?
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.520]   (laughs)
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.720]   - I mean, exactly, it's like, okay, no bonus if you messed up,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.240]   but you made billions.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.160]   - Exactly.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.280]   - Now the Chief Financial Officer got a bonus of $2 million.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.760]   And...
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   - I mean, let's face it, they're not poor, any of them.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.160]   - No, no, exactly.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.000]   You know, one hand I salute them just saying,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.720]   "Well, it's not about money, fine."
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.200]   But it is capitalism.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.680]   I'm puzzled by this one.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.680]   - You know what happened, 'cause Larry and Sergey
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   probably have billions.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.520]   You know, they, in fact, they did, as I remember,
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.080]   they liquidated some stock this year.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:05.920]   - Yes, they did.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.760]   - So they've got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.520]   And they both said, they're in the meeting,
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.880]   Eric Schmidt's sitting there,
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.160]   "We're not gonna take any compensation this year,
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.320]   we're gonna take one dollar."
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.840]   And they look at Larry, I mean, Eric.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.880]   They look at Eric.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.560]   - Well, actually, Leo, maybe that raises the point,
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.840]   because they liquidated some more stock this year,
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.960]   they just didn't, it was bad for taxes.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.680]   - Yeah, it could be a tax thing.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.480]   - It takes the income and it's gonna go nowhere, I don't know.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.560]   - I don't.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.400]   - We should be so lucky.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.800]   - Yeah.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.120]   - These are the problems you wanna have.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   - $1 is your number.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.080]   - Thank you.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.120]   I feel good now.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.160]   - Gina Trapani has a tip for us, Gina.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.400]   - I do, and I have a quick tip, Pimp.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.800]   I wrote a story this month,
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.520]   in this month's issue of Maximum PC.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.000]   - I love that magazine.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.520]   - Yeah, Maximum PC is a great magazine,
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.440]   and I am really privileged to have the cover story
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.840]   this month in the April issue.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.160]   It's called The Power User's Guide to Google.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.440]   - How do you find time to do all this?
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.960]   Good Lord, you must work 24/7.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.920]   - There was an all-nighter involved in this story for me.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.600]   - Leo, you do amazing things to watch.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.880]   - You, she's a yout.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.760]   - There are 45 tips here, 6,000 words.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.840]   I learned a lot and there's a lot of good stuff here,
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.680]   so check out the magazine,
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.640]   and I'm gonna feature some of the tips
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.320]   in the next few weeks on the show here,
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.400]   but you should buy the magazine,
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.000]   because they're good people,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   and it's a good read.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.720]   - So it's always been one of my favorites, actually, yeah.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.640]   - My small but relevant pimp.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.800]   So my tip this week,
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.920]   this is a new feature that rolled out in Wave,
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.480]   a much needed feature.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.120]   It's a very tiny step toward Gmail integration
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.720]   or just email integration.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.120]   If you have logged in a Wave and looked at it
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.040]   and thought it was kind of cool,
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.200]   but never went back again,
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.320]   and don't know when people wave you,
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.800]   log back in and click on the inbox,
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.560]   on the arrow, on the right side of the inbox.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.840]   There is now a new menu item called Notifications.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.080]   If you click on that,
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.960]   you can get emails from Wave anytime somebody waves you
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.440]   or updates a Wave that you are participating on.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.120]   So I think this is gonna--
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.640]   - Kind of buzz like.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.120]   - Kind of buzz like, but just let you know,
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.360]   something happens, somebody said something to you in Wave,
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.360]   which I think will make a really big difference for folks
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.080]   who use it occasionally,
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.320]   or just couldn't get other people to use it with them,
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.280]   or never had a reason to go back.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.320]   I've been using it this week,
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.600]   and it's looking pretty good.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   They really need whitelist,
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.800]   they need a lot more features,
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.120]   but this is the front of the first step
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.320]   to connecting Wave to your email inbox.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.120]   So check out Wave Notifications.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.560]   - Very good, very good.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.800]   And finally, and you get credit really for this one too, Gina,
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.600]   'cause you buzzed it or tweeted it,
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.520]   I can't remember which,
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.520]   and immediately whenever Gina says,
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.640]   "Oh, check this out, I immediately download it and try it."
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.160]   And your right is the coolest thing.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.880]   If you've ever used something like Launchy on Windows,
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.120]   or Launch Bar or Quicksilver on the Macintosh,
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:56.720]   this is the kind of the droid version of those programs.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.520]   It lets you, it lets you,
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.560]   oh, I'm holding up my iPhone,
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.200]   I should get my iPhone out of the shot.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.600]   That's terrible, terrible.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.640]   - You don't like the iPhone now,
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.280]   I don't know, I happen to have it around,
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.920]   but I'm a Nexus One lover.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.520]   So it's called Gesture Search,
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.000]   and it's kind of the same idea as Quicksilver,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.360]   which is you type the first letter
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360]   of what you're searching for,
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.000]   well, you gotta do it right.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.720]   See, you see the lag?
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.840]   That's just kill me on that.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.480]   So I typed you an H,
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.400]   and then I went off to Backspace
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.000]   'cause it has those previous strokes.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.040]   There's the H,
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.840]   and then it goes through what your contacts
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.960]   and everything else,
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.760]   and searches for everything from H,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.360]   and then the second letter narrows it down,
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.720]   and the third letter narrows it down,
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.680]   and you're typing below,
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.680]   and it remembers your gestures.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.920]   So now I've included my music in here,
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.760]   so I've typed H--
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.680]   - Is searching just the phone or the web?
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.240]   - It searches the web too, doesn't it?
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.160]   No, just the phone?
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.680]   It searches your bookmarks, contacts, music, songs.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.400]   - See, browser bookmarks, okay, okay, apps, music.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.880]   And music is not on by default,
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.880]   but I added that 'cause I have a lot of music on there.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.520]   And so I was typing H-O-U,
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.240]   and I got burning down the house,
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:07.000]   and the other suitable H-O-U's in here.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:07.840]   I just-- - How are you?
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.360]   - House, yeah, H.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.800]   Does it do lowercase two, Gina,
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.960]   or is it just all uppercase?
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.840]   - It does lowercase.
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   It does actually a very good recognition of letters.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.000]   - It's amazing.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.760]   It's really good, and I'm curious to know
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.720]   whether or not this is gonna become
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.360]   a universal input option, eventually.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.200]   - Yeah, why not?
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.200]   I mean, basically I'm able to--
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.000]   - It's the end of the old keyboard.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.360]   Is this the death of courty?
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.640]   - Right, right.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.960]   - I mean, it seems like Google's going out of their way
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.520]   to make input methods into your phone
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.920]   anything but the touchscreen, right?
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.040]   So you've got like, search by taking a picture,
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.120]   find something in the market by scanning the barcode,
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.680]   voice to text input, so speak your query,
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.360]   and now you've got this gesture search.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.080]   So it's like, how many ways can we get you
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.840]   to avoid your keyboard, which is interesting?
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.720]   - Yeah, well, I think that that's the future
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.400]   of computing in general is new input devices,
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.320]   and especially a small device like this.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.240]   You don't wanna use a keyboard.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.080]   - Right.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:02.920]   - I love it.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.280]   You were raving about it, and as soon as I downloaded it,
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.920]   I saw why it's a really useful little tool.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.000]   And it's free to get Leo.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.680]   Just your search, it's free in the marketplace,
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.080]   and it's from Google.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:15.920]   It's a laugh.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.080]   - And yet another non-iPhone app.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.240]   - And this is the list of apps available for Android,
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.360]   which is not available for the iPhones.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.560]   - Another shout by Southwest, Bragg.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.400]   Bragging right.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.600]   - Well, it goes the other way too,
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.600]   'cause a lot of iPhone apps that I thought were unique
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.960]   to the iPhone are now migrating over.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.120]   For instance, Bump, which I used a lot on the iPhone
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.560]   to exchange business cards is now available on Android.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.240]   And it bumps, you could bump with an iPhone.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.840]   So if we're at South By, you should always put this on here.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.360]   And you have all these snarky iPhone users saying,
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.880]   well, I guess I can't bump you my contacts.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.240]   You could say, well, yes you can.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.160]   Just, you know how bump works?
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.640]   You go like this, and it sends the contact information over.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.880]   - I have not done that.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.720]   That's cool.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.560]   - It's so cool. - Wasn't there one
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.320]   where you shook the phones together?
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.280]   You took the two phones and kinda put them next to one
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.120]   other and shook them?
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:02.960]   - That's it.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:03.800]   I think it's bump.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.440]   - I think it's bump, yeah.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.200]   And you could send pictures and other data that way as well.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.240]   - Can we fist bump at South By and?
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.400]   - Yeah, if you had your phone in your hand and I had mine,
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.280]   all you have to do is like that.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.520]   They don't have to touch.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.160]   It's just the accelerometer saying, oh, I got shook.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.200]   So shaking would do it.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.160]   And there is an application on the Android that I haven't
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.240]   figured out, but maybe it's just 'cause I don't know anybody
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.080]   that has it this week, make another tool called Hawker.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.560]   H-F-C-E-R like soccer that lets you throw things.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.240]   - Oh yeah.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.240]   - And then you can go like this and catch it.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.080]   So I could--
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:39.920]   - Okay, that's fun.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.760]   - Is that fun or what?
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.840]   - I dare you the two to just start doing that
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.240]   on the streets of Austin.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.800]   - We can play Hawker with each other.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.280]   So it knows where I am.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.440]   I have received, but I can also catch to receive a distribution.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.800]   And I don't know how you select the content this way.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.440]   So let's say I'm in my gallery and I wanna throw you
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.080]   a picture, Gina, or I could throw you my contact information.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.680]   - We are so doing this next Saturday and also by the way.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.680]   - We're gonna play Hawker, yeah.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.520]   - Heck yeah.
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.840]   - So I'm just gonna, let's say, oh, here's my media pass
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.880]   for the iPad announcement.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.440]   Maybe you could print this out and use it next time.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.520]   And I'll just Hawker it to you.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:18.120]   - Is that weird?
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.920]   - Oh yeah, that's cool.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.320]   - It's not on the iPhone.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.040]   There's no app for that.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.200]   And by the way, Apple--
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.640]   - There's a annoying smug geek.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.760]   - I know!
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.240]   - Hey, Snark goes both ways.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.640]   Let me just point that out.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.120]   Apple recently just killed all the, today, I think,
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.120]   all the wifi searching tools like Netstumbler on the iPhone.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.320]   They just killed them.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.160]   They're gone.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.640]   - Yeah, apps too, yeah.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.040]   What's with that?
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.320]   - Wait, wait, wait.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.960]   They got pulled from the App Store just today?
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.160]   - Yeah.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.400]   And somebody says it was pulled from their phone as well.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.160]   I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.840]   - I'd read something a little earlier in the week saying
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.440]   that apps that use, I'm not sure,
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.840]   'cause it would be crazy to pull all of them,
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.160]   but apps that use wifi to locate you,
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.080]   maybe in a way that without being explicit about it,
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.040]   I think they pulled those.
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   Like I remember Yahoo Maps got pulled
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.880]   because it tries to geo-locate you without GPS
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.120]   or cell signal.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.280]   So I think that was a little earlier in the week,
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.440]   but I did read about that.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.840]   - Reports came out a few days ago
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.080]   that all the iPhone OS applications that sniff out wifi,
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.040]   scanning the vicinity for signals and other information
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.880]   have been removed from the App Store.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:30.080]   They were dropped because they used a private framework
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.520]   hooks into the operating system that are not documented,
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.360]   which is Apple's done this before,
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.760]   nor allowed for third party developers to use.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.640]   So they got approved in the first place,
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.000]   but as is often the case, Apple, after the fact,
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.880]   said no, we're not gonna allow you to do that.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.280]   This is again why I'm just happy
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.040]   that I'm using an Android phone.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.000]   - Wow, you know, you contrast that to,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.120]   you know, I maintain a set of Firefox extensions
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.200]   for Google apps and they're not API based, right?
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.840]   They're based on just the HTML on the page.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.960]   They're user scripts, greased monkey,
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.040]   user scripts that do things to the page.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.520]   I actually got an email from Google saying,
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.200]   we're gonna change an app that you have an extension for,
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.840]   like the HTML is gonna change and we like to show you
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.040]   what it's gonna look like so that you can prepare
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.760]   your extension in advance.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:19.320]   Okay, so I'm using unauthorized hooks,
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.400]   I mean unauthorized being just the HTML
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.280]   into their app and they're helping me as a developer,
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.120]   do so.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.440]   So contrast that to Apple saying,
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.600]   like you're using methods that we have in published
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.440]   or API methods, we don't authorize,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.600]   so we're just gonna pull your app from the store.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.000]   I mean, that's the difference.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.080]   - I'm told Hawker is also available on the iPhone,
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.160]   so we can still throw things at iPhone users as well.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.000]   - Oh, okay.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.000]   (both laughing)
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   - Hey, thank you all for being,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.800]   Kevin, oh, I'm sorry, Kevin, you said you wanted
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:52.840]   to add something after our tips, tools and number.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.040]   - Yeah, actually I just wanted to mention that
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.240]   for all you Google fans out there who use Chrome and Android
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.000]   and you know, anything else that Google makes, pretty much.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.280]   I wrote a feature on Life Hacker this week called
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.040]   the Easy N-E-O-S Any Browser Password Solution.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.400]   And LastPass, L-A-S-T-P-A-S-S,
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.680]   I found that really useful for--
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.640]   - I use it like crazy, I love it.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.480]   - Oh, you do.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.400]   - Oh, I love LastPass.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.200]   - It's great and it's works for Firefox,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.560]   Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari on Windows and Mac
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.400]   and it's available, it has an app for almost every kind
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.040]   of smartphone there is out there.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:33.560]   And I just converted it over to it a week or two ago,
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:38.520]   but it's a really easy solution for keeping your web
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.840]   passwords secure and also having an eye or fingertips
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.120]   when you log in.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.880]   It uses something called Host Proof Hosting,
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.200]   which I'm not a security geek, but I believe it just means
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.120]   that your passwords are kept encrypted on LastPass's servers,
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.760]   but they never actually see that stuff.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.680]   The encryption happens in your own browser
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.040]   or on your own phone.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.320]   And I've just been using it on my Android phone
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.160]   and Chrome and found it really, really helpful.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.840]   - It's on the iPhone too.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.760]   And it's nice, it imports all of your bookmarks
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.200]   from Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox,
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.040]   I mean your passwords.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.880]   So if you've already got a large password store,
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.560]   which almost everybody does, you--
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.160]   - And Gene is a big fan of KeyPass,
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.320]   which is a source.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.240]   - Right, open source, right.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.920]   - And it can take imports from KeyPass and whatnot.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.760]   So I really got into it this week.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.160]   - I agree, Kevin.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.000]   What a great--
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:29.840]   - I'll talk to him.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.080]   - All right, I'm gonna check it out.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.560]   Our security guy, Steve Gibson,
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.680]   has heard us recommend it so many times
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.640]   that he says he's gonna look into its model
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.800]   and everything to make sure it is secure.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.240]   And I mentioned unsecurity now.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.760]   The only thing that worries me
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.520]   is the small company out of Vienna, Virginia,
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.240]   which is just down the road from the CIA.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.560]   And I thought, boy, if I were the CIA,
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.280]   I would make something like this, make it really good,
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.080]   get all the geeks to use it, just in case.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.280]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.640]   - Nobody could ever break this encryption.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.480]   - Yes.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:01.440]   - Nobody knows the way in here.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.880]   It's just, see, there it is.
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.560]   They're just down the road a little from McLean.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.400]   I don't know.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.240]   I don't know.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.080]   It could just be me, just my paranoia.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.360]   No, I don't wanna start any rumors.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.440]   They're perfectly fine, gentlemen.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.600]   And they make a wonderful product.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.800]   Good tip, thank you, Kevin.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.680]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.520]   Kevin Purdy is a senior editor at LifeHacker.com.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.240]   You can read his great articles about Android.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.040]   He's the Android guy there.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.840]   So I have a feeling we'll be talking to you a lot more.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.840]   - Thank you, thank you for having me.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:28.920]   It was great to be on.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.800]   - Wonderful to have you.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.240]   Thank you for being here.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.080]   Our good friend, Jeff Jarvis, is the author of
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.240]   What Would Google Do?
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.680]   A must read book soon to be the author of Beta.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.520]   I can't wait.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.360]   Is there a timeframe?
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.680]   - I have a page and a half written, I have no idea.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.600]   - Oh, so it's like next week sometime.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.160]   - Yeah, don't bug me like my editor.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.000]   I hate you.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   - Page and a half.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.040]   - I hate writing so much.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:50.880]   I just hate it.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.280]   I'm only laughing 'cause I'm not doing it.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.360]   But do get what would Google do.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.200]   That's actually finished and in the bookstores now
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.640]   in his blog, which he writes a lot.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.360]   And I think that's really great is buzzmachine.com.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.520]   Jeff's a really great blogger.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.600]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.

[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.960]   and also look for her article in Maximum PC this month
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.960]   and on everywhere else she writes for Life Hacker 2.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.600]   Great to have you on her book.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.440]   - Thanks for having me.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.280]   - Great to be on.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.120]   - Great to be on.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.880]   - The complete guide to Google Wave is at completewaveguide.com.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.720]   - Yes it is.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.840]   And next week I'm gonna have some fun news about that book.
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.600]   - Oh, from Live from Austin.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.360]   - Oh, yeah, we should say this.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.520]   I should have found out.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.600]   I think people can come see us do it.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.440]   - Oh, cool.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.280]   - Yeah, we're--
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:37.120]   - Groupies.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.040]   - Groupies.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:38.880]   We're--
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.520]   - I'm inviting all my friends.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.000]   (laughs)
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.440]   - Shawn Michael Wright is broadcasting as he did last year
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.360]   live from Austin.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.400]   And I think they have a, you know, it's nice fish films.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.600]   And I think that they have a,
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.400]   this is, we're gonna use their studio at South By
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.000]   and I think that we can, people can go there.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.680]   But I'll tell you what, watch our buzzes and our tweets
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.280]   and all that stuff and we'll let you know.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.880]   But that will be Saturday afternoon,
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.640]   a little later than usual I think,
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.360]   because it's Austin time.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.280]   - We'll post it on Life Hacker, we'll pack the house.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.840]   - Let's pack the house.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:17.920]   - That's pack the house.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.760]   - Let's pack the house.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.880]   And then everybody'll be going over to the dig party after that.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.720]   I want more people at our show than at the Dignation Show.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:24.560]   What do you say?
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.760]   - We can soap, we can pull it off.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.200]   Easy, sorry Kevin.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.160]   - If we promise that we'll be wearing red,
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.000]   Google's, blankets.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.520]   - No, no, k-ros.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.160]   - Oh, I can't throw these k-ros.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.480]   - K-ros.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:36.840]   All right, hey, thank you all for being here.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.760]   We do do this show normally live out of our studios
