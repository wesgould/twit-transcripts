[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff's here, Stacey's here, lots to talk about, including the new European copyright laws.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   What happens when you turn off Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple in your life?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And also the Euro acquisition. Is this good news or bad news for Euro customers? It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Netcasts you love.

[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google. The show where we talk about the latest from the Google verse,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   which could be Google, but it could also be Facebook, Twitter, the state of journalism in the United States,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and the Internet of Things. That's because this is a smart panel.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It could talk about a lot of things. We really basically focus on the world of the Internet.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Stacey Higginbotham is here. She's our IOT guru. Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Long time journalist at GigaOM and Fortune. Really, just super smart. Great to have you Stacey.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Soon to be selling your home. When is the last time we're going to see you in your studio?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, not till you'll see me here until May. We're moving the first week in June.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   But you have listed it.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The photographer is actually here right now taking pictures.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Wow. That's cool. Nowadays, do they do 360?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   You could be like that house that was, it was looking at the listing where it had an SNM thing.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yes, it will. I do not have a sex dungeon.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   God, not to say you have a podcast studio, which the sum will be just as odd.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I think it's hysterical. They put the dungeon in the listing.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Did you not see it? No.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It was like 50 shades of maple grove was the title of the listing.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It was awesome.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Well, you know, you got to have an angle.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Your angle will be a wired home, right? Smart home.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   That is the angle and that we have this awesome view and I don't know.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   We already have our first person. We haven't even gone on the market,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   but someone's coming by tomorrow to look at it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   We're going to use Twig to sell this house.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   There you go. Well, once we put it on the market publicly,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I'll send you guys a link and you can be like,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   "I don't know. You're worried about weirdos coming by to say,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   "Let's go look at Stacey's house."
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I don't know. How many weirdos listen to your show?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Lots.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I mean, you'll be able to find it.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Ask Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   There's a helmet and a drawer there.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   The letter tab. He's not one of them, but he's been the target.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   The Letter tab professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Neumard Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Great to see you again, Jeff.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Are you ensconced, surrounded by snow?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yes, I am.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Beautiful.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Snowy New Jersey.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I had a record crop.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   23 wild turkeys just walk across the backyard.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Oh, that's fun. We have wild turkeys, too.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Most stupid ever had.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Well, it's funny.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I've never seen a wild turkey.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Are they stupid?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   They're stupid, right?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   They're not as stupid as non-wild turkeys.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Right.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   The domestic variety, really.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   They're really cocky.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   They're really having a shot.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I just thought it was a shot.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I don't want to cock turkey.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I don't want one that was caught.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   We, like you, we have this kind of countryside and there's a family of turkeys.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It wanders up and down and they make their home in different yards.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I haven't seen them in a couple of months, but yeah, it's kind of fun to have, you know,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   turkeys, fox, fox, we have fox.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I thought you lived in Westchester County, Jeff.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I lived in Jersey.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He's enjoying it.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Oh.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I had no idea I was a trick.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.680]   No, I have to do not have an oil refinery in your me.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.880]   This is a common misconception about New Jersey.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   People think of it as the part of New Jersey that's just over the river from New York City
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   as New Jersey.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.040]   They've seen the sopranos.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   They come.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   You see them?
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   Here come the turkeys.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   There they are.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.040]   That's them.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   I've seen a wild turkey.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.720]   It looks just like the one on the label.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.720]   That's what I was just about to say.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.800]   Look how big they are.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.760]   Yeah, they're fattened up for.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Can you kill them?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   Oh.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   Is that allowed?
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   I'm sure it's allowed.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.880]   Well, no, in Texas, we have deer everywhere, but you can't shoot them.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.960]   In season, you can shoot them.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   I'm sure.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.840]   No, well, you can shoot them in season if you have a permit, but you can't just shoot
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.720]   them in season with a permit, like, on our common area.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.000]   I thought you were thinking Texas.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.800]   I thought that was just the thing.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   No, you can't.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.040]   It was in Texas.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   That's Austin for you.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.680]   That's nice.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.680]   That's pretty.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.680]   What a pretty kind of sight out your window, Jeff.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   For those of us who tell us.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.680]   It's why you say, "I live, like, three miles from Trump's golf course."
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.160]   Oh.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.120]   Are you there often protesting?
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.360]   I've gone there.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   I've done that.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.360]   Bedminster.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   Bedminster, yes.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   Okay.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360]   Oh, fancy.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   I can already tell you that's fancy.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   I don't even know.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360]   I don't even know.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.080]   It's just up the road from it was until he moved in there with the neighborhood.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.840]   Sorry, I don't know what I'm saying.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   Don't at Leo.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840]   You can't at Leo.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   You can't at Leo.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.880]   Actually, my Twitter currently, Twitter account and Facebook account are active because I
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.920]   have to periodically activate them.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.920]   I activate them and forgot to deactivate them.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   Okay.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   That's me.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   I do wonders.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.640]   Can I start with one danger, danger, danger, danger?
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   Please.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.640]   What happens?
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.560]   That signals 11 and 13 are back on.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.680]   Julia Radha, the green member of the European Parliament, describes them.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.640]   And it really is harrowing.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.400]   I can't find this piece.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   Yes.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.920]   She has a quick bill of points, but it's harrowing how this ruins the Internet.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.360]   This is so put people gone nuclear.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.640]   So let's talk about it.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.000]   Start with 11.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   What is 11?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.360]   And by the way, this is articles in what?
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.400]   You know, articles in a new copyright and across European copyright because now copyright
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.280]   is done by country based.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.200]   This is an effort to kind of a and a lot of people, including the platforms, welcome
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.360]   the idea of a single market view.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.280]   Where did I put it on the rundown?
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   I can't find it.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.560]   Well, I have in front of me.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.360]   Well, I know what I was going to have to do.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.040]   So I got Julia.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   Rita.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.840]   You second from the bottom.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.760]   I know there for two years, debated different drafts and versions of the controversial articles
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.440]   11 and 13.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.840]   But now there is no more ambiguity.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.640]   The law will fundamentally change the Internet as we know.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.760]   And by the way, we should say Julia's dead set against it.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.920]   If it's adopted in the upcoming final vote, we can still prevent that.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.240]   But here's the final text.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.600]   So should we start with 11 or 13, which?
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   Sure.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.120]   11 is a so-called link tax.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.760]   So reproducing more than single words or very short extracts will require a license.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.240]   That's the same.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   This is aimed at Google.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   That means you were me.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   This is aimed at Google search, though.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.440]   The snippets that they put in the search results.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.000]   But they can't just pass a law against Google so they pass it against every user.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.960]   So every time you want to quote someone and quoted it length and say something about it,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.880]   which we would call free speech, fair comment, good common sense and liberal democracy, you
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.880]   won't be able to do it.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.400]   You won't have to go and get a license.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   That's how blogging started.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   That's what blogging was.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   Well, sorry.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   I saw this text.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   I think this.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.120]   Look at if you want to, if you want a sample of what that looks like, look at daring fireball.net,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.320]   John Gruber's blog, which it's always extensive comments from another story that he then
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   comments on.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.120]   This is very traditional style blogging.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.120]   In Europe.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.680]   Will be illegal without license.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   No, exactly.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.040]   Even for services run by individuals, read bloggers.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.520]   Small companies, nonprofits.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.680]   No, no.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.240]   No, that's that is that alone.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.200]   That kills free speech on the net.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.080]   It kills the ability to talk about something.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.800]   It kills the ability to quote something.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.940]   It kills the essence of what journalists do all the time.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.920]   Isn't this in against the interests of the publishers?
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.080]   Don't these quotes help drive traffic?
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.940]   No, because they think that this is what this is the I'm going to say it.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.940]   I'm going to say it.
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.000]   Like the origins of this is the.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.920]   Each life, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.840]   So I look, for instance, I look at a John Gruber post.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.640]   He's quoting John Petchkowski for BuzzFeed.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.280]   He has he doesn't even I think have any commentary on it, but then there's a link that I would
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.160]   then click to consider the publishers starting with with with Springer and Borde.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   I consider that theft.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.960]   Oh, you're so wonderful.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.520]   I mean, if you got on Gruber's site, you got a good, a good, a huge.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.520]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.520]   Absolutely.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.920]   But they want to go out.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.880]   This is how they it's not just that they want to stop that.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.320]   They want to put them in a legal bind that says, this means you're stealing from us and
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.520]   you should give us money.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.160]   You witness will get to go have a new some and a little bit.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.640]   Gavin Newsom is talking about, you know, a digital.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.840]   The governor of California.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.240]   Yeah, sorry, governor of California, where the platforms.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.560]   Oh, everybody, everything is because they make money and full disclosure here.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.520]   I raised money from Facebook for my school.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   I'm independent of Facebook.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.920]   I received a money personally from many of the platforms.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.400]   I do own stock in Google and Amazon and disclosure.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.720]   Thank you for reminding me of doing that last week.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.920]   Stacey, but this kills the net.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:37.000]   This kills what what was their plan is is axles plan, actual spring is plan.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.200]   Oh, they'll still push published links, but they'll give us some money for doing that.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.840]   That was the hope of what happened in the German law was that Google said, fine, we're not
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   going to license from you.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.120]   We'll stop linking to you and the publishers all came back on their knees saying, oh, please,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.000]   okay, we'll say, okay, I'm late that in Spain, the same law was passed, but there was no
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.640]   exception allowed.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.560]   You couldn't give permission for it to happen.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.520]   You had to have a license arrangement.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.680]   And that's why Google pulled Google News out of Spain.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.920]   Google has threatened to at least pull Google News out of Europe and has shown a version
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.640]   of what Google would look like without under this law.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.040]   So beatmaster, who's a Swiss in our chatroom.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.440]   And so the Swiss are very neutral, says, all right, let's let's pose the opposite argument.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.760]   If people read the headlines or even read it, if people read a snippet, they're not going
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.120]   to click the link because they're going to get the gist of the article and move on.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.080]   I've heard that argument for a long time.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   Believe me.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.440]   Number one, you're not going to.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.720]   Some people do, some do, some do, but also also lots of a you can use.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.040]   There's no way to measure your proving a negative B. You should have been by that is
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.440]   that is that how many people would have gone to it.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.880]   Oh, that story bores me.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.880]   I read the headline.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   I'm glad I avoided it.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.880]   Thank you very much.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.880]   Right.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.880]   B.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   That's my favorite.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.560]   My favorite Twitter account is saved to a click where the headline poses a question but
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.560]   doesn't give you the answer.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.840]   So you have to click the link and the safety of click just gives you the answer.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   That's right.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.880]   Because the business model here is to dragoon you into clicking.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.720]   They're out of business by the way.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:22.440]   The second part is that is that how many articles are discovered because of these links
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.000]   that you would never have seen.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.840]   So and by the way, Google and Facebook are now helping publishers with their subscription
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.360]   plans, which I think is also doomed.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.400]   That's another story.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.360]   And they're trying to help drive traffic down the funnel to these publishers.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.160]   So this is a this is a vindictive act of corporate protectionism.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.280]   But what but but.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.280]   But okay.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.040]   So you could argue that's why these corporate interests wanted it.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.720]   But if the EU passes it, that's not a that's not a vindictive act.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.240]   That's because the EU Parliament said, yeah, they use their political clout.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   Would this be illegal?
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.040]   So here's the website or the Twitter feed saved you a click.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.760]   The Wall Street Journal coke launches first new flavor in over a decade.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.960]   Saved you a click says orange vanilla because that's all you really want to know of that
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   story.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   So is that a snippet?
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   Yes.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   Right?
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   That's the headlight.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   But the problem with the German laws, they never defined snippet.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.520]   They probably haven't defined haven't seen here yet whether they defined is there's not
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.520]   a magic number of words.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.960]   Same as fair comment.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.200]   There is no definition of fair comment because it depends upon the reproducing more than
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.800]   single words are very short extracts.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.480]   But we don't know what very short means.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.320]   You don't know what very short is.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.520]   So actually what Google's doing could actually be a very short ex ex yeah.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.080]   So you'll get to a search and you'll have no idea what you're looking at.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.280]   I'm trying to find the thing that Google put up about two weeks ago trying to show what
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   it would look like.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.480]   But I can't find it.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   So all right.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.440]   I mean, this seems kind of dumb, but we've also.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.440]   Oh, here we go.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.040]   Fair fire over GDPR and other things.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.960]   And they've kind of not been a bad thing.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.680]   Maybe this will be a good thing.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.160]   Oh, don't get me started on that.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   Like Leo, why are you poking the bear?
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.760]   And honestly, while you could make, I mean, there's no privacy purpose for this.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.880]   This doesn't benefit end users at all.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.520]   In fact, if anything, it disadvantages end users.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520]   Exactly.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.160]   This is clearly to protect the.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.640]   Or the bottom of the link I just put up.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.040]   See, Google put up something that show I can't find.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040]   Never mind.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   Oh, I always say.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.560]   So what about 13 at the risk of getting bogged down in one of these?
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.560]   Let's go to the next one.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.880]   13, which is really a problem as well.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.480]   So 13, where are you, Ms. Radha?
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.240]   Is going to screw you, Leo.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:54.320]   If you ever quote anything in audio or video, it requires commercial sites to buy licenses
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.600]   to anything that users may possibly upload.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   What?
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   That was the right reaction.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.960]   This sounds great until we get microtransactions.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.880]   And then it might be doable.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.320]   But this is not, I mean, that's not even something you could even set up a bureau for
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.000]   that if you are a publication.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Like even if I wanted to pay you 10 cents to quote you.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   So we would lose.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:29.040]   So I think that sounds like, okay, in our case, no one could listen to our shows in the EU,
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.120]   right?
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.400]   Because if you quote something.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.040]   We'd be uploading in a podcast.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.600]   We just did it a bunch of times.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.160]   Content from other people's sites.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160]   We're showing them.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   We're talking about it.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.560]   You also couldn't pull from EU publications, right?
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.800]   Buy licenses for anything that you just can't visit.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   Is it Paris anymore?
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.160]   You get arrested.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.400]   So am I correct?
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.040]   Is that a correct interpretation?
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.560]   If this passes, we do whole shows where we don't actually show anything.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.760]   But I don't want a chilling effect.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.800]   I mean, already in this show, we're 15 minutes in and I've showed John Gruber's website.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   Yep.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.400]   I've showed the Wall Street Journal.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.200]   I've showed people's Twitter feeds.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:19.000]   And with every show that we publish, we publish a list of all the links, all the stories we
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   refer to all the links.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   That's the show notes.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.040]   There's like 20 stories in every episode that we publish.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   You can publish the link alone.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.760]   But what's the link text?
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.160]   We can't put any text next to it if it's a snippet or an extract.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.680]   Surely, could put the headline.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.520]   I could put, we could put a description of what the link leads to.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.720]   I don't think that, well, we don't know.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.640]   But I'm more concerned.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.960]   So because, okay, so I'm showing John Gruber's website.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.840]   This is copyright material in the United States.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.440]   Is it only material that's copyrighted in the EU?
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.840]   I don't know.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   That's a good question.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.680]   But the next piece is, let's say somebody in your chat room, Leo, it's your chat room,
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.360]   puts up a big block quote from something.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   Happens all the time.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   Your level.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.360]   Right.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   That's a bigger one.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   Shut off chat.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   Sorry, chatters.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360]   Bye.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.520]   So the upshot of this, by the way, how does Julia say this is going to pass?
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.120]   As of now, I mean, she's calling bat signals.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.360]   This is soap and peep of time across Europe.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   This is fight at time.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.520]   So she's trying to fight hard.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.320]   So she writes, "The history of this law is a shameful one.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.960]   From the very beginning, the purpose of articles 11 and 13 was never to solve clearly to find
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:37.480]   issues in copyright law with well-assessed measures, but to serve powerful special interests."
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.600]   I think you can argue that pretty much all the copyright laws in all the world are to
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.880]   serve special interests.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:49.520]   But all right, with hardly any concern for the collateral damage cost, the collateral
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.120]   damage in this case would be I would have to turn off, I would have to look at you when
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:59.680]   you come into the chat room and block you if you're in the EU, right?
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   This doesn't affect probably.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   Probably.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.040]   Or you would have to tell all of us, "We can't show anything."
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.560]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560]   We can't do that.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.360]   That's a chilling effect that I'm not willing to accept.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.800]   So now imagine you are a European Leo, the class he cultured Leo Laport, the one with
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.640]   Beret, true to his French name.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.280]   So your cousin Leon Laport is doing a podcast in France.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.840]   How does he operate?
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.000]   He has to say, "I can do nothing but make my own stuff.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.360]   I can't quote anyone.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.560]   I can't show anything."
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.720]   Well, you could presumably, as you pointed out, a lot of what we do, which is, "Did
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.760]   you see this?"
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   And here's a problem.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.040]   I mean, we could talk about story.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.320]   It's actually sad because one of the things I try to do when we talk about a story is
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.360]   refer to the sourcing reporter and publication.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.960]   So we would have to just stop doing that.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   We'd have to just say well.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.600]   So I start a rant against something.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.360]   And Stacy says, "No, Jeff, you're wrong.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.840]   You're saying the wrong thing.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.760]   Let me quote what that person actually says.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.760]   Leo says, "Shut up, Stacy."
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.520]   Oh, you know, well, in one sense, it would make you do a lot of reporting.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.520]   I mean, as an old school journalist who actually had to call people as opposed to just like
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.880]   lift stuff from press releases and Twitter accounts, you'd just be like, "Hello?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.080]   I mean, it'd be a pain in the butt."
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   Well, that's a positive.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.040]   But every thing individually, everything would have to be doing reportage based.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.960]   And that means it eliminates commentary.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   It eliminates commentary.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.520]   It eliminates fact checking.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.760]   Look out that way.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.160]   I want to quote this thing and say why it's wrong.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.440]   I can't quote what I'm saying.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.880]   That snopes doesn't work in that.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   Snopes.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.640]   Of course, we know Snopes is fake news now, so it's okay.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.920]   So here's an example.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.360]   We've been quoting Julia or Rita in her blog.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.920]   We couldn't do that anymore.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.960]   This is so patently in the ethics.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.480]   But that also turned people who have.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.240]   So would that also turn people who write stuff?
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.040]   Can I even wear a beret?
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   Is that even allowed?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:14.360]   If I did reporting what I have to open a licensing division to like let people quote
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.760]   my stuff, no, that would be hard.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760]   Right.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   Yes, it would be.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.120]   And in fact, if you're Julia, you don't want us to quote you.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   Yeah, you wouldn't lose all this traffic.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.960]   It puts Stacy on IoT out of business.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.440]   Now, it keeps Springer in business.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.540]   Let's be clear.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.000]   This is only in the EU.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.640]   So the defense for Americans and other countries is just say, well, as by the way, many newspapers
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.360]   already do with GDPR, we're just blocking you readers, listeners.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.600]   They can't come in the chat room as various publishers blocked EU readers because of GDPR.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.920]   Would we get 10,000?
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:59.520]   Would we get sued by somebody in the EU for doing this in the United States?
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.860]   If we're visible to somebody in the EU, yes.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:07.620]   So we just have to work very hard to keep people from the EU from seeing our forbidden
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.620]   content.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:15.500]   I mean, obviously we're taking this to the extreme, but this is an extreme measure.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.020]   And yes, jobs in the chat room.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.460]   This all feels like an overreaction as if the EU hasn't considered all these possibilities.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.460]   Oh, sorry.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.460]   May no.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.220]   Yeah, and they've done it and Julia, Rayda and others have been fighting hard and they
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.520]   won.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:38.800]   And then the powerful lobbyists are publishing and Hollywood, the version of Europe come
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:46.160]   back and the news publishers go for 11 and the entertainment people go for 13.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.080]   And we're back with soap of people.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:54.920]   And here's what your Google news would look like if article 11 passes.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:00.360]   No pictures, no text, just a link, just a link to the Liverpool echo.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.320]   For those of you listening, it just has a blank box on Liverpool Echo four hours ago.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   That's all it says.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   Doesn't say what's in it.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.680]   Doesn't say why you should go there.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.060]   Doesn't say anything because they can't.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.060]   That's ridiculous.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.060]   This is Google news.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   Search.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.700]   Okay.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.540]   So we should just ignore this.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.900]   No.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.940]   If you know anybody in Europe have them right to their.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.940]   Yes.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.820]   Let's right now you need everybody listening.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.980]   We 30% of our audiences overseas.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.580]   People and countries around the world who because of the show who recognized me on the
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.220]   street in Munich.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:51.700]   So please if you are in the EU, write your representatives and say and point out to them,
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.660]   maybe they haven't considered the impact of this.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:59.220]   You can look up your representatives voting behavior and save your internet.eu.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.620]   You know, I have to say this is a trend global trend also.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.500]   This is not restricted to the EU.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.980]   This is what, you know, the big copyright holders would like.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.140]   They think I don't think they realize the consequences of this.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.860]   Otherwise they wouldn't like it.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.560]   But you know, and this is what Corey, Dr. O and others have been in vain against the
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:27.000]   world intellectual property organization, which and the DMC way, a which undermined
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.560]   all of those fair use.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.480]   There's no fair use in the DMCA.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.760]   It fortunately, nobody seems to have been forced it.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.560]   But it's still bad policy to pass laws as hoping nobody will enforce them.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.360]   So go ahead.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.000]   Thank you for allowing me to do the.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.240]   No, this is a hair on fire or ray on fire in my case.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:59.480]   So at some point, you're going to have mass disobedience.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   That's what happens.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.240]   When laws get passed that are untenable, people just don't obey them.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:11.000]   Hank Green did a great video explained to all their listeners why what viewers, why
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.200]   his brother, John's video about, I think it was European football was taken down.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.160]   He went through the whole process.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.560]   Very good explainer video.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.920]   I'll find it and send it to you about how the process works now with YouTube.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:31.320]   And he says, you know, it basically kind of works, but we all violate the law.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.480]   And the, and he says that it's in the interest of those we violate against to keep it up
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.200]   and get money from it and to get promotion from it.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.560]   And we all know this.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.800]   And so nobody's really following the law.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.640]   And it's all absurd because the law is absurd.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:51.680]   I thought the United States was the only province of big money influencing politics.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   So new.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   Here we go.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   I thought it.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   I found some very good video.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.400]   Don't they have campaign finance for Florida and Europe?
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   Oops.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   Oops.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   Oops.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.680]   Well, you playing it's not going to do us any good at all.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.600]   Try to put it up here.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   Flip your screen around.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   Hold on.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   Okay, there you go.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600]   You got it.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   It's an excellent, it's an excellent video.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.600]   Dear, I play it.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   I play it.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   I'm worried about a takedown now.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   Well, then we're very funny if Hank did a cake dog against you.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   For complaining.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   First copyright video.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   Here.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   Let's say.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   There's a blatant violation of copyright.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   I just stole it.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   But somehow that's okay.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   We live in a brave new copyright world and the solutions really aren't legal anymore.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   They're technological.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   So for the people out there who are making content and are confused about copyright,
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   this is the bizarre state of intellectual property.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.920]   Okay, I'll just leave this as an exercise for the viewer or listener.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   Yes, exactly.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.920]   But it's very good.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   It's excellent.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.720]   But it's on YouTube, the bizarre state of copyright.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.240]   Cool.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.760]   I kind of blame Zay Frank for the state, the bizarre state of YouTube video.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.760]   Incidentally.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.200]   Chump cuts.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.240]   It was Zay Frank, who many, many years ago.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   I did this whole thing of never-ending and then just random cuts in your video.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.600]   And clearly Hank was heavily influenced by Zay Frank.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   Everyone was.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   Everyone was.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.960]   Except me.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.800]   We were talking earlier before the show.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.160]   We could show it at 20 minutes.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.000]   We could kind of wait out.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.240]   We were talking before the show about different styles of podcasting and video casting and
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   stuff and how mine is influenced pretty much by just live radio.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.480]   Because that really is a live radio show.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.360]   And how in consonant that is with the trendy NPR style, the Gimlet spouses or the YouTube
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.240]   styles, there are various YouTube styles, but they're all kind of, "Oh, a debt to Zay
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   Frank."
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   Were you to try a different style?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.480]   What would it be?
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.280]   I wouldn't even know how to start.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.840]   I mean, technically I know what to do.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.200]   We can technically do that.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.160]   I would like everything to be shot in black and white.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.040]   I think you need a fog machine in the background.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   Oh.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   All to today.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.920]   We should do noir.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   We should pretend.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   And I can talk to our cigarettes.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920]   It would work with my beret.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.360]   Or a fedora.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.360]   I have fedoras.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.360]   Do you ever smoke Stacy?
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.360]   Oh, there we go.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   Welcome to this week in Google.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   Tweak War.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   Tweak War.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   Tweak noir.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.560]   We all joined today by the very attractive Jeff Joffis.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.360]   You know, I actually look okay in black and white.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.920]   I don't look as freaky.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   And I actually think you're hurt.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   It's glowing.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.000]   We don't know why he looks like a nuclear power plant.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.760]   Well, the Chernobyl Jeff.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:53.160]   The meltdown has begun, but that is just as weighty.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.200]   My other hand is a very liberal Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.840]   Oh, you have to call me a dame.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.600]   Actually, she's a dame.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.400]   And how do you say Higginbotham with a French accent?
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   Higginbotham.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   She has the long jam and the beautiful fiery temper.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:18.560]   I love him.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.320]   I like how you're walking that line, though.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.360]   You're like, I am very nervous about.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:29.140]   I know I can go over the line here with Stacy because she could hit me even though she's
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.200]   thousands of miles away.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.000]   I just fear her.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.080]   I'm concerned, Jeff, but it seems so absurd.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.680]   I feel like how could this possibly pass?
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:46.600]   But the thing is, yeah, when Spain did the link tax, hurt the publishers.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.240]   It was meant to help its corporate protectionism.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.840]   Every single, I mean, I did a presentation and I'm not going to bore you with it now,
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.080]   but I went through every single one of the major pieces of European regulation and everyone
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.400]   had an unintended consequence, which in the end gives the platform is more power.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.560]   Even Google and Facebook as much as this would hurt them, they're in better shape to weather
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.120]   it than anybody else.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.080]   I mean, the people who really get hurt are the small podcasters blog.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.760]   The giant helpers of the world, the twits of the world.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.120]   Those are the people we just would have to turn off our European faucet.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.120]   I don't want to do that.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   Nope.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.360]   What if we do now?
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.920]   I know Stacy, you don't think much of Ben Long's stuff.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.400]   Yeah, let's talk about this dude.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.680]   That was a little sulte voche warning there.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:46.800]   What if we do what Ben says and just say, no, we're not going to pay your fines?
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   He says, Google could just say, we'll turn off service to the EU.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.760]   I don't want to turn off service to the podcast to the EU.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.840]   But if I just say, no, I'm not going to pay your fine and go come and get me.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.960]   Could they come and get me?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.120]   Could the European police break into our studios and drag me off?
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.520]   No, I mean, they would have to file.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.080]   I mean, the process of arresting you would be, boom, they're going to file charges against
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.080]   you.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.800]   They have to get an extradition.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.880]   It's not even civil though.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.360]   It's not even criminal, right?
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.520]   It's civil.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.800]   So they would have to sue me in court.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   I would not show up.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.360]   They'd fine me and absentia.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   They'd say we won.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   Are these laws?
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.600]   We won a billion euros from you.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:37.280]   And they'll say, so you go on your next river cruise with your permanent work of life.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.720]   No, what happens when you land there?
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   I don't know.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.320]   You just cause celeb.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.560]   I wear my beret.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.960]   They take me to go like this, take me to jail.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.760]   French will complain that you made fun of them and you're now you're really good.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.120]   Leopold, what is his name?
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.120]   He wears.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.920]   Who is he pretending to be?
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:06.560]   So they're actually he's a long street says that France is actually trying to reduce a
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:13.960]   tax just for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, a gaffa tax.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.960]   Now I guess Google could walk away from a country.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   They don't want to.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   They walked away from China.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   No, they don't want to know.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.640]   And they walked away from China because of being asked to censor, which is against its
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   principles, right?
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.240]   Walking away because of, I mean, I guess if Google wants to plainly state for everyone
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.200]   that collecting people's data forever and keeping it for whatever it wants to use it
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.640]   for is one of their principles, which it is, then you know, that would be a reason to
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:51.280]   walk away from it is, it is clearly one of their economic is all debt.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.480]   What is he?
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:59.080]   I am just saying that it is they do want to collect information about people.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.240]   They want to collect information about people.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.560]   Unlike mass media, they want to serve people as individuals can disagree about their motives.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.560]   That's fine.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.800]   But what if the EU at some point decides to find Google the maximum that they can find
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.200]   them?
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.440]   Which is good Google says, I will leave.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.280]   I'm not giving you four billion dollars, dude.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.720]   That if they shut down Google, well, look at the ask cashmere hill.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:28.200]   I mean, if you really got tough and Google shut down for a day, it wouldn't be good.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.960]   It actually would be good worse in France than it is here in the United States.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.520]   French that is not more of a.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.760]   Somebody wants to behave.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   I mean, because it's true.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   France is still a democratic institution.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:45.200]   So if Google were to basically take all its toys and go home, yes, people would be sad
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.680]   and say to their government, how dare you do that to Google?
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:53.160]   But the rest of us would look at Google and be like, dude, that was a jerk move.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   You should probably not.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.160]   Would we?
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   No, no, no.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   I don't think so.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.920]   I think we'd wave flags and say bravo Google.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:06.640]   If France find Google the full 4% of their annual revenue, which would be 4.4 billion dollars.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.840]   Or a GDPR violation.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.680]   Google said, Google said, we're not going to pay it.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.600]   We only make 2.2 billion a year from France in advertising revenue.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.560]   We'll just say fine, we turn you off.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.840]   You don't like it?
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.880]   Well, we'll turn you off.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.640]   It is a law that was passed by several.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.680]   I don't know how many countries are now in the EU.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.680]   It represents.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   I mean, this is one viewer.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:42.640]   A company cannot flout the rules democratically elected society and pretend to be not.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.640]   Okay.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   So let's say they don't flout.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.600]   Let's say they say, all right, we're going to give you 4.5 billion, but bye bye.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.800]   That's not flouting.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.320]   That's paying the fine and then saying we're not going to do business here anymore.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.960]   What if they did because of your law?
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   Because of your law.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   Because of your law.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   Because then that's fine.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   That's fine.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   But for good people like.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   Well, they're going to be like.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   They can afford it.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.360]   They pay the fine.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.760]   You have to follow the laws of countries that are not evil in.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.760]   Great.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.680]   So that's what we're talking about right now with something that's about to become a
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.520]   law that is really untenable.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520]   It's evil.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.520]   I know you would.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.520]   I mean, I don't like it, but.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.320]   Well, I think it's just not the right way to pursue your goals.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.840]   Well, I mean, they could.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.480]   If I mean, the idea that Google would go straight to being like, eh, it's not worth
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   it.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   You don't generate Google.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.280]   Of course would fight it in court.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   That's the way these.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   Yes.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   That's what's happening right now.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   That's what's happening right now.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.200]   So to just like to basically say screw you in the process of law that we've all lived
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.280]   under for, you know, the last 150 years would be.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.440]   That's a dickish move.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.200]   No, no, you're absolutely right.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.640]   So they fight in court.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.720]   If they lose in court, they pay the fine.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.000]   And then they say, but I'm sorry, we're not going to pay it again.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   So goodbye.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.600]   That's that's their left only in the EU and in the UK when it's left the EU.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.720]   But then they leave the UK because of the Caron Cross review, which is going, which
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:10.680]   exposes the government should tell Google and Facebook to correct things on their platforms.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   So ultimately it's a shrinking world if you start leaving.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.000]   There's not a lot of places.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.320]   In fact, the US, I mean, you just mentioned Gavin Newsom in the California privacy law.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.880]   They might have to leave state by state.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.080]   There is a, I'm going to say it.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   I'm going to say it.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   Stacy, Stacy, get ready.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   I'm going to say it.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   Hey, it's more.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.360]   I'm happening or I'm happening.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.600]   So this is, so there's this, there's this constant.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.760]   Oh my God, the internet is ruining everything and it's BS.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.760]   I'll tell you though, Jeff, it's a mistake to conflate GDPR with articles 1113.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.320]   You should, it's a, because I think it's appropriate to ask for privacy.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.560]   And so it's just bad.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:00.180]   I think it's a well intentioned, badly written law, GDPR 11 and 13 are ill intentioned and
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.180]   horribly written law.
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.960]   And I don't think you should make the fight, have the fight on two frets because that's
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   going to be tough.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.160]   And I think Jeff conflating the internet with the giant companies that currently dominate
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.280]   the internet is probably a conflation we should avoid too.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.360]   Well, except Stacy, I'm prevented as a blogger from doing what I've done since 2001.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.080]   So I'm the internet.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:26.600]   No, that's why I say don't mix, don't mix this new copyright law with GDPR.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:32.480]   GDPR companies like mine can, can adhere to, can continue to do our business.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.800]   We're not surveillance based.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.480]   And so GDPR is not a problem for a lot of the internet.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.080]   I can criticize both laws.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.160]   Yeah, but it'd be, be careful.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   Don't come to it together.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.880]   Yeah, because if you lump it, because on the other hand, this new copyright law would
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.920]   put all of us out of business in the EU, it would put my show out of business, it would
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.440]   put your show out of business and put your blog out of business, or we would have to
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.720]   be something very different.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.800]   So yes, there's harm to Google there too, but there's also harm that I think Stacy would
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.200]   be fair to say that law is anti internet.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   Yeah, I'm not.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.440]   We're not talking about that law.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   GDPR is different.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.400]   And that's not what this dude is talking about when he's saying we're not.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.160]   No, but it's, but that same issue is going to come up in other contexts too.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.600]   I mean, at this point, what you have is if these, if these laws get passed, then, you
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:29.520]   know, again, there are processes that we generally follow when we disagree with democratically
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.720]   created laws.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.680]   I mean, it's not come to civil disobedience yet.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.240]   And civil disobedience by companies, I look heavily a scan set.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.160]   They're not in it to make our country or our laws better.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.720]   They're in it for themselves.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   Stacy, some of people.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:51.320]   Lots of countries put a black pages on their websites and kind of shut off their content
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.600]   for a day as a protest.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.680]   Did you, you didn't object to that?
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.920]   I didn't object to that.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.840]   And that was a one day thing that was not shutting.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.080]   That's not saying I'm taking all my toys and going home.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.280]   That is an example before a law is even passed to say, hey, this is what it's going to look
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   like.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.640]   I think Google will act as an adult, not as.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.640]   Oh, yeah, they will.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.640]   Not as a child.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.760]   I think in the privacy of their wonderful cafeteria, I think they're due some childish
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.160]   stomping their feet.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.040]   Well, heck, I do that after this show, Jeff.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.520]   Sometimes I'm like, in his war.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:35.240]   And I'm sure you're like, oh, Stacy, don't you recognize that free speech is a.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.960]   Johnny Johnny Stacy.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   Johnny.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   All right.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:47.720]   I'm going to I'm going to now come back to the United States.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.880]   Enough of these freedom fries and talk about WordPress.com.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.840]   That's where I make my home on the net.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.800]   I love WordPress.com and I have I have long standing relationship with WordPress.com.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.640]   I started using WordPress when Matt Mullenwig first published it way back when because I
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.360]   thought this is a great way to make a website.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:14.280]   And of course, very quickly I learned that buying my own host hosting a machine, licensing
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.320]   it, downloading WordPress, installing it, managing it, running it was not really why
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.160]   I was creating a website.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.680]   I mean, it's good for me because I need to learn all this stuff.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.880]   But then I said, but now I want to post content.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.520]   I'm going to WordPress.com WordPress.com does all the nitty gritty.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.920]   They host it.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.360]   They do all the upgrades.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:37.200]   They keep all the security patched just so you could focus on what you care about your
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   website.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.560]   And then they have the tools to make it easy.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.400]   You don't have to be a CSS or HTML expert to use WordPress.com.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:49.280]   I've been on WordPress.com for 12 years and I love it.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.600]   For one thing, if you ever have a question, they have 24 hour a day support, including
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.440]   weekends from actual WordPress experts.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.520]   So they can really help you.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.200]   I even asked them, you know, what template should I use?
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   What do you like?
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   That was great.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.160]   I mean, I loved it that they could say, yeah, you should probably, if that they told me
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.480]   you should probably use 2016.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.000]   That's like, it looks like a good site for you, a good template for you.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And they were right.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.080]   That's what I'm using right now.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.320]   You can see my WordPress site at leolaport.com.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.000]   WordPress was started so that anyone could publish their ideas and they're doing it.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.480]   They are doing it.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.000]   Now 33% of the internet runs on WordPress.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.560]   30, that's one third.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.520]   33% of the internet is on WordPress.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.520]   That's amazing.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:37.840]   The WordPress platform is easy and it's free to start, but it'll give you room to grow.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.040]   There are no two week trials, no hidden fees.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.600]   And most importantly, you own your content.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.800]   Everybody, you can have a Facebook page.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.920]   You can have a Twitter feed.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.280]   If your business, you should have those.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.960]   But that can't be your only home on the web.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.920]   You need a place you own, a place to put your content, your pictures, your text, your
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   video, your audio, somewhere to put your content that you own.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.240]   You can upload and download from WordPress.com.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   It's yours.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.880]   That's so important.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.520]   Millions of people use WordPress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.480]   I hope you will too.

[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.200]   I know maybe you haven't done this because you're worried how complicated it is.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.200]   It's not.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.680]   You don't have to be technical.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   It's easy.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.880]   I can do it.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.480]   If Jeff can do it, you can do it.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.520]   WordPress.com/twig.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.880]   We're big fans.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.520]   Is Buzzmachine a WordPress site?
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.040]   And I have some help from Sun Jake.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.240]   But now I'm on Gutenberg.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.240]   Oh, the new editor.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   How do you like it?
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   How do you like it?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   I like it.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.040]   It took me about 20 minutes to say, wow, they think it here.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.760]   Of course, I love the name.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.360]   And yeah, it's very, very easy to work with.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.440]   And everything is a block.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.600]   When you put up a new block, it can be text to headline a photo and anything.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   I think once you get it, it's very powerful.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.600]   Exactly.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.160]   It's a little bit to suss out.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.200]   Like literally 10 minutes to suss out.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   Well, how does this work?
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.200]   But I sussed it out.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.560]   I didn't have to read any manuals or any of that old-fashioned stuff.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:18.880]   And I like you use the various features of WordPress to like the social sharing buttons.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.600]   You've got your tweets right there.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.440]   I do the same thing.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.880]   You've got your books there.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.840]   These sidebars are really powerful too.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.240]   I just, yeah, good.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.240]   Nice.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.400]   And you know, WordPress focuses on content.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.160]   And I think that's important for you.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.920]   It's certainly important for me.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.720]   I have three WordPress blogs.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   Three.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   Okay.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.840]   Overachiever Stacey.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.840]   Maybe I have more.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   I don't really know.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.880]   I'm the one up us boys.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.400]   They're so easy to set up.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.000]   You just throw it out there.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.440]   I think that's what I love about the free and open web.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.200]   And that's why I really like you, Jeff.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   It hurts me.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:08.360]   It literally fizzily pains me when people threaten this because it's been such an amazing democratizing
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.360]   force.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.840]   And I know there's bad stuff, but that's the world.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:17.360]   The internet is, we can't ever forget what an incredible transformation the internet has
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.360]   made to the internet.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.360]   Amen.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.360]   And the free and open web is really what it's all about.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.400]   Jeff, that you should have a shirt that says the open web.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.320]   Web is my religion.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.600]   That is what you need.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   That's true.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.200]   I'll wear that shirt.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.520]   See, a lot of people just like I already have.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.320]   What does his shirt say?
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.000]   Descent is patriotic.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   That is true as well.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.600]   That is also true.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:45.240]   Ah, big size.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.360]   I know I'm like sitting here going, where is my drink?
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.360]   Yeah, I know.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.720]   I'm going to drink in a donut.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.080]   If you were here, you could have a drink.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.400]   Oh, I can text down and get a drink.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.560]   Oh, OK.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.400]   You could text for beverages and a donut.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   Wow.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   I can't text for a donut.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   That's the--
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   Drinks in a donut.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   Unfortunately.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   On the way up.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.240]   That would be awesome.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.280]   What do you-- Jeff, you started this.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.280]   What else do you want to talk about?
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.280]   I started that.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.280]   So Stacey, you can put a good extra on.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.600]   I was just looking through trying to think what else I wanted to talk about here.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.320]   I like Google fiber, but there's not a lot really to discuss there.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.200]   Oh, I know what I want from you, Stacey.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.880]   I know what I want you to talk about.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.800]   Tell me, tell me, tell me.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   Amazon by narrow.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   Oh, euro.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.800]   Yes.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   I don't know what to think about that.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   That's a big story.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.960]   And I can put it in the show notes.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.880]   Are you a thumbs up or thumbs down on that?
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.160]   Now we should say euro was a sponsor.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.240]   And I use the past tense.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.480]   They still are in theory.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.440]   But every time Amazon buys one of our sponsors, they seem to lose interest.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   Disappear podcasts.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.680]   And to my knowledge, Amazon's never bought podcast advertising.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.280]   Audible was the first.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:59.800]   And I think they still do some podcast advertising, but not on our network.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.720]   Ring, same thing.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.960]   They paid a billion dollars for ring.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.120]   We don't know how much they paid for euro.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.640]   Euro, if you don't remember, is the mesh networking solution.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.720]   We all like a lot.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.720]   I have them.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   They're running right now.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   Me too.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.280]   I stalled them at my moms too, because I can monitor network from here.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.320]   So the concern some people raise is that, well, now Amazon is just going to use this as one
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.880]   more way to spy on us.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:29.040]   For instance, well, but wait, Jeff, your earo knows every device in your house that's connected
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.000]   to the internet by name and MAC address.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.280]   Well, because it's a router, it also knows exactly where you are on the internet.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.760]   It knows when people come and go because they join the router or they leave the router.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.080]   So it knows when you get home, it knows when your kids get home, knows when you leave
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.080]   the house.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.920]   It also knows when you're naughty and nice.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   It knows.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.920]   It knows.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.200]   How your devices communicate to the internet and where they communicate too.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.720]   So I'll show, I mean, like if I go into my earo app, I can see, for example, right now,
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.720]   what do I see?
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:06.680]   Oh, I can see everybody's in my house, but I can also see, sorry, I'm looking at my devices
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.760]   and I can see which ones are idle and which are communicating.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:17.040]   Right now, like, dude, for some reason, my sink is talking to the internet.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.480]   I don't know why.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.200]   But that's interesting information that, you know, certainly Amazon.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.240]   I'm like, "Sink, what the heck?
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   Actually if I see that for enough time, I'm like, "Hey, that's weird behavior for my sink.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.480]   I need to investigate, like, you know, I have earo plus.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   I have a shelf sink.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   She's coming."
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   By the way, yeah, I have earo plus too.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.720]   That's the $99 you're at on that gives you a lot of features.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.560]   Well worth it, I think.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.800]   So, so fine.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:52.080]   So, there's the paranoid rant about the big company, but in terms of functionality or
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.520]   benefit, oh, there's lots of synergy too.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.160]   Okay, well, hold on.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.480]   Let's hold the phone because, Jeff, you did ask me my opinion and I'm going to give it
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   to you.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.760]   Because I did.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.360]   This is a data story.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.440]   This is a data story in two different ways.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:14.320]   One, it's a story about how Amazon has access to amazing data from what people are buying
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:20.480]   and how successful those purchases are to make decisions about what it should buy.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.880]   So that's data story number one.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.600]   Amazon has access to data that a lot of times people pay investment banks and consulting
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.520]   firms to find out in terms of market share and that sort of thing.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.760]   And Amazon even referenced earos 4.6 star rating in their press release.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.760]   So that's why-
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:38.760]   Hold on right there, Stacey.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   Okay.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   I agree.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   I'm just curious what specifically-
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.880]   In presuming Amazon is going to follow GDPR is going to follow privacy things.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:53.160]   What does it learn that it didn't know already because you buy everything you buy from Amazon?
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.480]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   That's not nefarious.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.240]   I say this is genius.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.960]   This is one of those.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.320]   This is a point in Amazon's favor.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.960]   I'm just pointing it out because a lot of people-
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   Ooh.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:09.080]   And this is actually how Amazon has worked for now, I guess, over a decade because with
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:15.040]   Amazon Web Services, it has done this for a while where it's like, "Hey, what services
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.760]   are getting big on our platform?
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.680]   What API calls are we seeing?"
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:22.720]   And it uses that to determine what sort of features it should launch next or if it should
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.040]   buy a company.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:30.640]   So just by virtue of being a platform of its size, Amazon gets a lot of competitive information
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.440]   about other companies.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.160]   And I don't think people understand how that helps it be successful, but this is a really
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.040]   good example of how that helps.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.880]   So that's one site.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:46.840]   The second data sharing thing is by buying Eero, it does get access to a lot of information
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:52.360]   about devices on a person's network, where a person goes on the network.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.320]   As any router would.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.560]   As any router would.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.920]   And I want to be clear-
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:02.280]   Eero has, in my opinion, very clear and in my opinion, very good privacy policy.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.200]   It was absolutely something I read before I bought an Eero and everybody should read
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   that.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.280]   And that's the question.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   That's the question.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.000]   Because they have all this added functionality, right?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.520]   So here's where we should get really clear about what we're talking about and what's
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.960]   scary, because I think it's really important.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:27.960]   Amazon, our Eero has first off said, "Okay, our existing privacy policy stays the same."
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.200]   So we do collect information about what devices are on your network and we use that information
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.800]   in aggregate and anonymized to talk about things.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:41.040]   So in some ways that's good for Amazon, because even if I don't buy devices from Amazon,
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.600]   Amazon gets that same insight into devices that are hot by virtue of seeing the percentage
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.040]   of them out in the wild.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.960]   So that's good for Amazon's future business goals, right?
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.360]   Oh, they know what's hooked into your Wi-Fi and what you use most.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   Right.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.360]   So even if I didn't buy it from them.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   So that's interesting.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:03.800]   The other thing is Amazon says in all of its data gathering activities about my smart
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.440]   light bulbs and whatnot, because I'm sure you guys saw the Bloomberg story, where it's
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:13.280]   asking smart device vendors to basically share information about when things are turned
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:19.200]   off and on and when they're used, even if they're not being activated through the echo.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.160]   So people got up in arms about that.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.160]   I am kind of neutral about that and I'll say why.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.160]   Amazon is not using this for advertising.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.360]   They're very clear about that.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.040]   They may one day and that would be a problem.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.920]   But today they use it to provide context and build algorithms that can anticipate your
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.560]   wants and needs, which is what everyone says they want from a smart home.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:46.280]   And I think here's where we get into a core issue that I think is going to be.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.160]   We're talking about privacy right now, like it's the defining issue of the current era.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.840]   I think what the real defining issue is going to be is trust in transparency, because these
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.400]   companies do have this data.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.880]   And if they use that data to make better products or to do things for you, a lot of
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.760]   people are okay giving that data up.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.880]   If they use that data to manipulate you into buying crap you don't need, people are going
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.560]   to be rightly pissed about it.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:15.000]   So I wanted to make those subtleties clear because I have a problem with certain kinds
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.840]   of data sharing, but not with others.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.760]   And so I don't want you to just shout techno panic at me, Jeff.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.480]   Well, no, I'm right.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   You're right.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.040]   The issue is also good.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.040]   You're right.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.040]   I'm going to say.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.080]   You know, people say, well, what Euro knew this?
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.960]   Why do you care that Amazon now knows?
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.680]   The issue is not so much that Euro knows it is that Amazon can collect a bigger and bigger
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.680]   pile of data about you.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:42.800]   And by connecting the dots in the variety of data it has about you, it really knows perhaps
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:47.320]   more than you even realize about you and what you're up to.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   It does.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:54.000]   And as it starts launching things like a health service, and what I'm really interested in
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.160]   is as these monot, these companies establish these huge data troves, where the firewalls
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.920]   between different data things and what's, what aspects of what data stores are getting
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.000]   shared with what partners?
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.080]   Because I think that's, I don't want my health insurance company knowing if I have like a
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.360]   connected medical device that my doctor hasn't prescribed or maybe that I'm not using a
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.120]   connected medical device that my doctor prescribed.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:26.200]   I don't want that to go through my get out from my router that's also owned by Amazon
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:30.800]   to my insurance provider who is now contracted with Amazon's new health division.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:36.600]   Yeah, you're also making me flash on a friend of mine who's a brilliant entrepreneur engineer
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:44.360]   here in Jersey, had a company some years ago that for a whole lot of reasons was tied
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:51.720]   into your electricity in your house and every appliance you use has a signature of its electric
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.760]   usage, which is tractable.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:58.800]   So you can find out which brand of washing machine and how long it's on and so on and
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   so forth.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:06.200]   It's interesting that you get it to the full grid of the house and no one's threatening
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.120]   to do that yet, but it could be just plugging in your echo could do that, right?
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   If they wanted to do that.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.840]   So you can actually detect, I mean, there's mics in a lot of things now, right?
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.160]   You can actually detect certain appliance brands and things like that just by the sound
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.160]   their motors make.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:28.520]   So if you look, if you think about that, in Kevin and I actually on this week's show,
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:32.200]   we talk about some disclosures that we think need to start happening.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:37.040]   I think and I'll tie this back to last week when we talked about Nest Secure, basically
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.160]   disclosing to everybody suddenly that they had a microphone in there that you could opt
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.920]   into to have the Google, the Google Assistant on it never was like, what?
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:51.960]   But I think any device that comes with a microphone or a camera, that should be disclosed
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.920]   in the specs on the box way of front.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.160]   All kinds of sensors.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.160]   Yes.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:59.160]   Yes.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.400]   Everything should be upfront because I think it's important to understand if you're going
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.200]   to connect something, what might be activated?
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.280]   Because there's a lot of sensors and a lot of these products that aren't activated yet.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.720]   And I don't think people are aware of that or you just don't see the data associated
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.720]   with it.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:18.280]   I think all honesty, first of all, that's nice, but you have so many devices now in the typical
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:24.360]   home that there, you might as well just assume a perfect map is made already of your presence,
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.280]   your things you use, the devices you own.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.160]   I mean, I think that that's, you could, you could fairly safely, whether it says it on
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:35.880]   the box, assume that there's enough devices and certainly your home Stacey in my home,
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.480]   that a pretty perfect picture already exists.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.440]   And I'm actually not worried about what they've done with it up to this point.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:49.040]   I'm very worried though about once this data is aggregated, what could be done.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:55.080]   And it involves kind of envisioning a dystopian future.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   You?
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.680]   It is the panopticon.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:04.240]   But I worry that we're giving, the problem is one, if it happens, is too late.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.600]   So we're giving them that.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:11.040]   I agree with Jeff in the sense that I get benefits from it and I'm not worried that Amazon knows
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.840]   what kind of washing machine I have.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.480]   I don't see the harm in that.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:22.320]   But I do worry, well, for instance, if you have an era, if you have an era and your mistress
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:28.000]   has an era and you go to her house at a certain time of day and certain time of night, that
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.200]   information is recorded by the year could be aggregated.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.800]   It's the aggregation that's a problem.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.200]   And at that point, what is Amazon going to bust me?
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   No.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:44.440]   But I just, it could be sought by authorities.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.600]   Could your wife's lawyer get that?
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   There you go.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.100]   Yeah, possibly.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:52.120]   And it's not a defense to say, well, then don't do anything wrong.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   That's not what we're talking about here.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.120]   That's not what people do.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.800]   I don't see it at immediate harm.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.880]   And this is what I always challenged people to, like to foreact what I always were.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.240]   He was worrying about this 10 years ago.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.240]   I said, well, what are you worried about?
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.320]   He said, well, the insurance company is going to know you're eating a donut and raise your
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.640]   rates.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:15.440]   Those are to me almost aminimous, partly because the insurance company isn't going to raise
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.440]   your rates.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.160]   They're just going to deny you coverage.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.200]   They ask you this already at the beginning.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:25.200]   And if you lie about it and then have a claim, well, now they can just say, well, we're not
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   going to give you any money.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:31.120]   So it's not information insurance companies don't already kind of have and collect.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:36.440]   I'm much more worried about this kind of, and I can't put my finger on it, but a sort
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:41.560]   of negative future where all of this information about you is there.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   I don't know.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.800]   What is the vision of harm?
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.720]   So there's a couple of things here.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.880]   And I just got to tout my show left and right because I had a lawyer on last week's show
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:58.240]   was what happens when your smart home is issued with a subpoena and we talked about
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.800]   harms.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   There's two issues.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.440]   One is data discrimination.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:09.400]   So any sort of behavior that's derived from this data, it's hard to prove harm because
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.440]   that harm could come way down the road.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:18.360]   The other thing is it is also hard to prove harm because we don't know how the data influences
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   these algorithms.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:26.120]   Currently, a decision could be made about your health insurance cost based on something as
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.080]   esoteric as how many times you open your bathroom door.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.480]   That's right.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:36.200]   And you will never know that the bathroom door is why that happened.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:41.800]   And also because of that, we don't actually judge.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.160]   There's not enough scientific actuarial data to say, hey, that bathroom door is a totally
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.520]   reliable indicator of something.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.080]   So there's a lot of stuff we don't know.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.640]   There's a lot of stuff that's unproven but is just assumed to be correct, kind of like
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:03.040]   the 10,000 steps number that came from a Japanese study that is not like definitive
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.040]   or health.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.720]   It turns out there's a lot of stuff like that.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.080]   Basically made up.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.160]   But we when we hear the word data, our brain shuts off and it says, oh, it's a fact.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.160]   It's good.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.320]   So those are the kind of issues around harm.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:25.880]   And I would say you may the fact is we'll never know unless like intrepid reporters go
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.280]   out and look at things like I mean, look at the people.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   I don't know if you remember actually someone in the chat room is pointing out a story about
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:40.360]   CPAP machines that insurers that were connected in doctors were sharing data from those connected
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.960]   CPAP machines with insurers and the insurers were using that data to deny people coverage
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:50.520]   for that expensive machine based on whether or not they were using it and some other
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.680]   subtleties that I'm not going to get into.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.240]   That is a real harm.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.760]   So I mean, there are actual harms out there that are existing.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.520]   Can I turn this around?
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:13.200]   I turn this around and ask what do you think Amazon's plans are to use this for products
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.680]   and what benefits could it crew?
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:21.280]   I think Amazon's big plan for this is what it states, which is it wants to understand
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:27.880]   how people use the home to make the echo a lot easier to use and to do some cool anticipatory
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:28.880]   things.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.760]   So I think that's Amazon's goal here.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:36.080]   I think we'll also use the data that it is gathered in its own decision making process.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.240]   Not just the data.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.160]   If you tied together, because I think somebody said they were disappointed that the echo
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.040]   isn't a mesh.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:51.120]   You tied together these various technologies and designed it now.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:55.720]   If you're Amazon, what would that look like and tell me it's not a fire of phone?
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.720]   It's not a fire phone.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.720]   I'm just joking.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.320]   No, it would be Amazon's failed product.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:07.240]   No, I mean, it would not be difficult to say, oh, hey, let's just pop a router into every
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   smart speaker.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.120]   I will a smart speaker in every router.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.320]   Yes, of course.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.280]   The challenges that would raise the price.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.800]   I mean, the dot is the best selling one and the reason why is it's cheap.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.920]   So you also have to think about your, if you add the hardware associated and brains associated
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:32.600]   with today's mesh routers, you would blow the price of your echoes out of the water.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.760]   So that's what they Google.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.760]   So imagine, Casey, if you took the, go ahead.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   Sorry.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   I mean, this technology, they've had both a smart home hub and a mesh router for a while,
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.680]   and they have yet to consolidate them.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   Right.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:48.000]   So imagine if you, if you, in your new home in Seattle, you haven't bought one yet, right?
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.200]   Are you going to build one or?
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   I'm going to rent.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.800]   You're going to rent it first, right?
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.560]   So then you find your perfect spot, your perfect lot, and you're going to build the ultimate
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   Stacey house.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:04.520]   It's built H A U S and in every room, there's a box.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.680]   Maybe it's a remake electric plug.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.520]   Maybe it's a rethought.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520]   Intercom.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520]   I switch.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.520]   Like we used to have, right?
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.520]   Something.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.520]   It's a box, right?
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.760]   And it can have incredible functionality in it.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   Right.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.360]   So what all could be in that, in your rethought home, it could be a router in every room.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.440]   It could be an echo in every room.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.160]   It could be what else?
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.720]   What is, what is, what is that?
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.440]   If your Amazon and thinking five years down, what does that look like?
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.280]   So I thought it'd be awesome to have that stuff in the walls, but I changed my mind
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.360]   because I'm going to want to upgrade my router, right?
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.440]   I was like, oh, you just pop it in the light switch.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   There's power.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   There's everything.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   It's perfect.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.480]   Then I was like, no, no, I do not want to rip my light switches out every two to three
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.000]   years when Wi-Fi alliance changes the Wi-Fi standard.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.040]   So I think there's going to be an external box that functions as a access point or what
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040]   not.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.240]   Maybe it's plugged into the wall.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.040]   I also think that you're going to see a lot of other devices act as access points and
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.320]   they'll just be higher in devices, not the cheap stuff.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.560]   So it's not going to be under $20, wise cam.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.320]   It's going to be in your fancy Sonos speakers.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:24.480]   We already see this in Lanar and KB homes or building homes that basically have a, you
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.480]   know, you've got your electrical cabinet and then you have your IoT cabinet and in that
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.600]   cabinet, you see everything's wired up.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.240]   You've got a fancy router.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.480]   You've got your various hubs that you still need to have for functionality of certain
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.680]   systems.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.200]   And then, you know, you have echoes throughout the home as the control medium or in the
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.200]   case of KB, it's Google.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.400]   And so I think that's going to be the model for a while.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.640]   I think we will start seeing things built into the wall.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   Like my new house will have smart switches already in the wall, right?
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.920]   I would love to see actually air quality monitors in my wall for everything.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:08.000]   I would build my HVAC system to heat and cool certain rooms like so having actual ducts
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.240]   that can.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.040]   I was like, turn off and on.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:19.200]   That's the gesture I'm making here for individual cooling and heating of different rooms.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.840]   Let's see.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:29.000]   I would love to have presence detection in my room and my house, but I don't want the
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.720]   presence detection to be sent out to the cloud or another service.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:39.720]   And I think we've kind of gone past that and you're going to hate me, but I am reading
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.120]   Shoshana Zoboff's book.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.120]   It's an excellent book.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.400]   And the technology and I know, Jeff, you're going to roll your eyes.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.560]   I don't agree with everything, but it's called surveillance capitalism in it.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.600]   She was a guest on triangulation.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.320]   Her basic tenant is that at this point, it's got to the point where these guys are going
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   to have so much information.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.120]   They can not only predict your behavior, but influence it.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:13.560]   And ultimately, that's the harm to both personal sovereignty and democracy.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.240]   And it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:23.360]   I mean, that's the thing I took most away from this is we take a lot of this data sharing
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.720]   and aggregation as a matter of fact, but it doesn't actually have to be that way.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.280]   We could actually buy systems and you'll see in my recommendation that don't actually
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.760]   go out to the cloud.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.920]   So, you know, there's-
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.080]   I think that's what's going to happen.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.320]   There was, you know, I think Renee Richie said, it says, "Shame, it was really hoping
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.600]   that Apple would buy Eero.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.560]   Would that have been a better outcome?"
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:51.240]   You know, the fact that Apple left the field just as well, actually, a couple of years
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:56.320]   before Wi-Fi started getting hard was inexplicable to me.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:02.480]   I really thought that they would use their airport router as a way into the store.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.560]   They had that opportunity, didn't they?
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.160]   Yeah, and they just, they didn't do it.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.920]   And it was so weird to me.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.920]   So weird.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:16.840]   And then of course, his point would be that we trust Apple and so Apple could reasonably
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:21.080]   own Eero, do all these wonderful things, but we wouldn't have to worry about our privacy.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.480]   I think that may be the way forward, which is there will be some companies that will
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.640]   disinter, that will break the chain.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.520]   I don't trust Apple in the smart home in the sense that I don't trust Apple to support
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.720]   a given product over a 10 year lifespan that I might expect.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.720]   Well, we know that, but they're better than Google in that regard.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.720]   I will say that.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:46.400]   I'm like, oh, you know, Apple, you're just, if I put this into my house, now I'm locked
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.520]   in, you're going to screw me over every few years with some weird change.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.840]   And I don't want to think about my house that much.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840]   That's the only thing.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.520]   I will grant you that that is, yeah, that is a potential issue, but I think they might
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.920]   have been a better steward of our privacy.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.920]   That's because they can make their money so many other things.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.120]   Everybody thinks they're so virtuous.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.480]   Let's be clear, they couldn't succeed in the ad business.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.880]   So they didn't have a use for the data.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.720]   So they turn the bug into a feature.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.720]   But that's good.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.720]   Now that rip off.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.320]   They're trying to rip off journalists like crazy right now.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.960]   We'll get to, let's do that story.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.840]   So this is rumor, not fact, but the Wall Street Journal and others are saying that Apple is
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.720]   asking the Apple, as you know, has an Apple news.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.520]   It's free right now to Apple users, but they're apparently looking at at least two new subscription
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.120]   services.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.920]   One is a TV service and one is a news service.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   They bought texture.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.000]   Another one of our fine sponsors that got acquired by a big company.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.960]   They bought texture and texture was started by, we should point out, by Hearst, Condi,
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.960]   and I think some others.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.600]   - I think it was my original piece.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:58.360]   - The idea was we're going to own our destiny and digital.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.200]   We'll have a service that you subscribe to.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:06.760]   We'll distribute the money and that way people will still get magazines.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.120]   And so texture, and I love texture.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120]   I think it was a great service.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.120]   I'm actually very sad that it looks like the end is near.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.760]   Apple bought it, but now the Wall Street Journal says Apple is going back to those publishers
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.280]   because by the way, the acquisition of texture did not mean that they acquired the same rights
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.040]   that texture had.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.720]   So they have to renegotiate all these deals.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:29.960]   They're going back to publishers and the rumor is, and I credit it because obviously these
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   publishers are getting offered these deals and going to the journal and saying you won't
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.360]   believe what Apple has said.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.640]   They want 50% and no subscriber data will be passed along.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.080]   Do you think?
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:47.240]   - As opposed to, let me just add here, Facebook, which sends people, I believe, I can get this
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:53.280]   wrong, but I think Facebook sends, helps publications, find out who's going to subscribe and sends
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.960]   them to them and takes nothing.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.120]   And Google, which has said that they're going to take only enough to cover their bare costs
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.880]   and that's next to nothing.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.840]   - Yeah.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:10.440]   So if that's the case, is that too much to ask?
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.440]   - I think so.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.680]   - I think especially at this time when--
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.080]   - What if they bring them twice as much traffic?
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.680]   - Well, same argument that Google makes or they'll make.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:27.160]   - Apple's plan apparently is to charge end users $10 a month and then to divvy up that
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.720]   50% of the keep 50 and divvy up the other 50% among the publishers based on the amount
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.800]   of time, I think this is really interesting, the amount of time users spend reading.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.280]   So it'll be directly connected to the amount of time they spend reading that content.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:48.760]   - So I think there's a few issues with this and I just wrote a post this week, I called
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:54.400]   the, you showed it earlier, the scorched earth and I don't know if it's not popular or some
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:59.840]   folks, but I think we've hit the, we're very near the end of how many paywalls we can have
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.840]   on earth.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.920]   They're not gonna work.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.920]   But there's an interesting issue.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.640]   - I would agree with you by the way.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.440]   I notice and I'm sure our audience also notices that now that we hit so many of them, I'm
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.880]   saying, okay Bloomberg, I'll take my nine articles and keep moving.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.440]   I'm not gonna pay for it.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:23.000]   - And there's publications I choose never to make on in case I need that one article.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.760]   My son lives in Boston, I'm interested in Boston.com occasionally, but when I hit the limit, okay,
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.760]   no big deal.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.080]   - Even worse, there are a lot of paywalls, you can't even read the content at all.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080]   - Right, right.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.080]   - And I was talking as a public interest today.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.600]   - I was talking as a public interest today and I said, somebody comes and they hit a
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.240]   paywall and that's a potential customer, it's the worst thing you can do with them.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.240]   You lose them.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.640]   Anyway, the Apple thing, which is the same argument I have against micro payments, which
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.400]   everybody thinks is gonna be the Messiah that suddenly saves everything.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.240]   I've had 25 companies come to me saying, I've got it, micro payments is gonna save
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.240]   everything.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.320]   - It's so funny, we've been saying that for 20 years at least.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.280]   - But part of the problem here is that if you are the Wall Street Journal and if you
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:12.320]   charge $600, $800 a year and if I can now get articles from the Wall Street Journal on
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:21.200]   Apple for, you know, pennies, literally, potentially that hurts the Wall Street Journal badly.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:26.240]   And so it skews the value in a way that could be additionally harmful.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.960]   So not only do publishers get pennies, they only get half the pennies.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.480]   So we'll see.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.280]   I also wrote, as far as how that story I wrote to somebody in a big company and it's somebody
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:41.000]   in a small company, I said, opportunity for you undercut Apple, which will have it.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.600]   - Well, and Apple may also back down.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600]   I mean, this is-
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   - Yeah, I think it will.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.600]   - Like a trial balloon.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.000]   - They're also trying to put together a TV deal and the journal reports that Netflix
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.840]   has already said under no circumstances.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.760]   And HBO is saying, "I don't have HBO yet either."
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.760]   So Apple, this is Apple, by the way, has had this happen from day one.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.360]   The music industry didn't like them.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.040]   iTunes eventually had so much clout they had to deal with them.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.160]   But this is, you know, they've been trying to put together TV deals according to reports
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.800]   for years.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.960]   So it is an interesting issue.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.920]   What do you think about Cashmere's Hills attempt to block the big five?
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.680]   - Man, I thought that was so almost heroic.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680]   - Painful.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:38.160]   - Man, yeah, I was like, "Good Lord, this person dragged herself over broken glass to basically
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.160]   do her job."
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   - Well, Bravo.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.640]   - She's an excellent reporter.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   - Yeah, Bravo.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   - Yeah, she is.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:48.320]   - And she's been on our shows before, we love her, because this is a really interesting
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.320]   question.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.960]   Okay, if you don't like the data collection of Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.800]   Apple, can you use the internet without them?
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.640]   - And the answer is basically no.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.560]   - She couldn't listen to music in her car, because her car had Ford's sync in it, which
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.480]   is based on Microsoft's car platform.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.360]   - She could listen to the radio.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.400]   She did say that she was listening to NPR.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.560]   - She had to listen to the radio.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.560]   That's pretty much--
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.160]   - I have not done in years.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   - Seven.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.280]   - Now, I did have a problem a little bit with her experiments parameters.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:24.960]   So deciding that in not supporting Amazon, you couldn't deal with companies that were
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.960]   hosted on AWS.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   - Well--
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   - Well, no, I mean--
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:34.400]   - If you hated Amazon and wanted to give them nobody or data.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.480]   - Right, but you could not boycott something as large as Tyson food, for example, today,
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.840]   unless you wanted to grow your own, right?
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.520]   So there are other industries where companies are just as large, and we just don't see them.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.960]   We're like, let's say you hated the-- what is it, UU line, or the Koch brothers?
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.200]   I mean, it's hard to boycott their stuff, because they're everywhere.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.000]   - Well, I don't buy bounty paper towels.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.840]   - I do like the selective size.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.400]   - I can't remember if that's-- is it Broni?
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.880]   I can't remember which theirs are, but--
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.880]   - Bounty or Broni?
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   Anyway, the point here is--
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   - But that's interesting.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.360]   Of all people, I would have thought you would pay attention to that kind of thing, and not
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.080]   by those products.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.480]   So you don't bother, you don't try.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.880]   - It's too hard.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.840]   And it is way too much mental energy.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   I know.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.640]   - Well, she chose to use, for instance, proton mail, which has its own servers deep within
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.720]   the mountains of Switzerland.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.920]   And I use-- you remember I got that helm, which is my own server, my own hard drive.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:44.200]   I keep all my data away from Google by doing that, but helm routes all my server through
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.720]   for AWS instances.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.920]   So even though it's encrypted-- now here's a question.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.520]   It's encrypted.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.880]   So they're not getting access to any information from me, not even metadata.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.320]   It's completely encrypted going through there.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.560]   They're just using their IP address.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.040]   But I guess indirectly I'm giving them money.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:09.320]   So is-- I guess-- I mean, I know Cashmere would not have used it.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:15.640]   - Well, I mean, yeah, AWS is-- it's a lot of the internet.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   - It's everywhere.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640]   - So I don't--
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   - Yeah.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640]   - But it's also--
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   - Actually, you couldn't watch Twit.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   - Yeah, but that's right.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   - Well, let's see.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.880]   You could watch Twit because it goes through Cashline, but our website goes through AWS.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.040]   So you couldn't use Twit.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.320]   You couldn't go to the website.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.800]   I don't know which podcast apps use AWS, but I bet a lot of them do.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.360]   How do you even find out?
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:44.720]   She had a custom-designed router that blocked anything with an Amazon web services address.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.000]   So she just-- it wouldn't work.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.400]   - I kind of wonder if the experiment and that aspect of it was kind of brute force.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.280]   That's the only way-- well, that's kind of the only way you could do it.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.280]   - Yeah, you have to do that.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.280]   - She first tried to use--
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:04.680]   - Or if you had an-- if given the site had used a happen to come across a programmatic
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.280]   advertising that used either Google or AWS, she'd watch that too.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.080]   So anything involved, it all banned.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.080]   Yeah, that's--
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.080]   - She couldn't use it.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.080]   She couldn't use Dropbox.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.080]   - She couldn't use Dropbox.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.280]   - Because it's hosted in AWS.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.440]   She couldn't use DuckDuckGo because it's hosted on AWS.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   So basically, she had no search engine.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.800]   - Yeah, so I take your point more Stacy now.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   I see your point better because it kind of stacks the deck in the narrative that they've
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.640]   taken over the world.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   - Well, I mean, it does.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.640]   - Yeah.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640]   - And it also--
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640]   - It's not true.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.560]   - I mean, and she may have had to choose that because she was using a pretty blunt instrument
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.800]   to avoid it.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.680]   So she probably should have said that.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.120]   - You know, there is a-- I think about people who try to use laptops, people in the free
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:56.360]   software foundation who try to use only free software, not free by note costs, but liberty
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.640]   free.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.960]   And it's very hard to do.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:06.600]   And like almost all the Linux laptops out there have proprietary software or chips that have
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:13.320]   Intel chips or chips for the Microsoft's trusted platform on there.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.360]   And there's all sorts of issues.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.360]   It becomes very difficult.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.040]   She ended up using a Purism laptop that's kind of designed.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:26.120]   This is almost-- one of the things she illustrates is you have to be fairly privileged to not
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120]   use these services.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.120]   - Yeah.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.560]   - To buy expensive new laptop.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.600]   You had to buy a Nokia phone because you couldn't use Android or iOS.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.520]   So she's using a feature phone.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:41.960]   - Well, in some of the-- I mean, so yes.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.280]   So there's that aspect.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:50.960]   And in the real world, so Uline, the boxes company, if you've ever got a small business,
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.640]   you've gotten the Uline catalog with shipping materials and all this.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.680]   Very small business and many large businesses buy things that are shipped in their boxes
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.400]   and shipped using their gear.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.600]   And to me, that's what AWS is.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.880]   And people hate Uline because those guys are actually--
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.880]   - It's infrastructure.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:14.000]   - Yeah, but those guys are huge supporters of crazy right-wing Republicans.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.560]   So there's a lot of people who are like, "I want to boycott this in the camp."
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.640]   So that's how I feel like AWS is.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   And are you--
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.600]   - Well, but this is why she did the experiment.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.600]   She proved that point.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.600]   - Yeah.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:34.240]   - I think it's probably good that she tried to be 100% pure because it became really
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.040]   clear how hard that was.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.840]   - Well, here's an interesting way to turn around with the story we're talking about before.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:45.360]   So imagine if either Amazon or Google said FU Europe and literally pulled out every service.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.560]   It's not just, "Oh, I can't search anymore."
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.320]   It's, "Oh my God, imagine all the things that wouldn't work."
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:57.240]   So this is the thing that's scary, that gives these companies huge power.
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.240]   Political power.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.400]   - Well, they're not doing a very good job of using it.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   - I know.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.880]   - They're losing every battle.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.320]   - Maybe because they're not being firm enough.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.680]   - Not being tough, yeah.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.680]   - Yeah.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.680]   - But of course, if they do, they're going to be accused of being countries of themselves
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.680]   and all that.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.840]   - And we shut them all down.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.960]   - It's 1475.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.960]   People were lucky.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.280]   - We had a 30 years old.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.080]   - We just got the freaking Bibles for come on.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.080]   - Yeah, geez.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.080]   - Geez.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.440]   - We haven't even invented the title page yet.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.720]   - Meanwhile, the New York Police Department says, "Google in ways have got to stop sharing
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.560]   our drunk driving checkpoints."
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.960]   I can't understand their point of view on that.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:36.960]   - I do.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.720]   - But I also think that if people in ways don't do it, somebody else will.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:49.480]   - And this is exactly why we need a new way of talking and thinking about data sharing.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.480]   Like around tech.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:57.240]   And this type of data sharing can advantage big people and small people.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:03.920]   And the ability to aggregate and search out and then display easily all this crazy information
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.880]   just puts everyone on more even footing.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.120]   And that's really uncomfortable for a lot of organizations than people.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.120]   - I love--
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.120]   - So let me ask you another question.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.120]   - Okay.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.120]   - Let me see one thing.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.120]   - Okay.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.120]   - I love the response of Helen Whitty, the president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.080]   She said, "I don't care because people who are that inebriated aren't really checking
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.920]   their ways to avoid the mustache cop."
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.920]   - I'm rich.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.280]   - She says, "If you're impaired, you're not going to pay any attention to that information."
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.320]   She said, "In her experience, drunk drivers coming through sobriety checkpoints were often
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.400]   very confused or unaware of what was happening."
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.920]   What's going on?
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.560]   What's happening?
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.800]   Where are you?
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:49.120]   And then other people complained about the image of the police officer on waste.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.120]   - I think that's--
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.120]   - With the mustache?
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.120]   - Yeah, it's friendly.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.160]   It's a friendly cop.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.120]   I don't know.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.800]   - Is that a drunk-- is it always drunk driving or is it just a cop there?
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.800]   - Popo in general.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.400]   - We have to do part of all the reasons and share it.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.400]   - Do you have no refusals?
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   - What?
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.680]   - Do you have those?
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:14.640]   So on weekends in Texas, on certain big game weekends or Thanksgiving, there's a lot of
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.320]   there's checkpoints and there are no refusal checkpoints.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.640]   So everyone has to breathe into a tube.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.320]   - No, I think the way it works, at least in Petaluma, actually, there are some issues
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.240]   about DUI checkpoints.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.360]   In theory, it's fine.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.840]   In Petaluma, the way it works, they talk to you.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.240]   And if you seem inebriated, then they may, just as they would if they pulled you over,
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.200]   ask you to walk a straight line, that kind of thing.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:42.200]   And ultimately, if they think you're intoxicated, they might ask you to submit.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.920]   But you can always refuse in California, then they just take you to the station house
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.400]   and they drop blood.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:55.360]   - I like to reaction Stacy.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.240]   I think the photographer is done shooting your house.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.480]   That's the sign.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.000]   But the reason I think we know who's boss.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   - Yeah.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.800]   The reason I'm not fine with the sobriety checkpoints, at least in our area, is most
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:13.000]   often who gets pulled over and stopped and eventually their car impounded is illegal
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.640]   aliens.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.680]   That in fact, it nets far more undocumented people, please.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.760]   - Yeah, I know you can't say illegal aliens.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.720]   Undocumented visitors, then it does drunk drivers.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.920]   And I see it's kind of sad.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.560]   You go by and you'll see all these cars that have been impounded in these poor guys and
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.560]   gals.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560]   - Really?
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560]   - Yeah.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:43.880]   - There's another political thing to say.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:49.480]   My in-laws would say, "Good riddance."
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.440]   - So I got one for you Stacy and Leo.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.440]   I think it's an interesting question.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.920]   So now you have various parties going strong after the platform, saying that they should
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.160]   eliminate the dens where anti-vaxxers breathe.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.880]   - That is a really interesting question.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.520]   - So is that the job?
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.400]   Is that the job of Facebook?
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.480]   Is God knows its misinformation?
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.480]   God knows it's harmful.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.440]   - Basically, is it like shouting fire in a crowded theater?
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.000]   Except is it like shouting fire in a closed loop?
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.760]   - Especially since we're having what measles outbreaks in the northwest.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.760]   - Exactly.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   - But these are horrid people are actually...
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   - People are actually...
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.760]   - People are getting sick.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.760]   Some are dying because of this.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.080]   Is it Facebook's job to do that?
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.080]   - Wow.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.080]   I'd say no.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.080]   So do you see?
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080]   - I'm thinking about this.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080]   - I'm thinking about this.
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.080]   - That takes a little fun out of Stacy.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.640]   What do you think first?
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.720]   Geez, we need hot takes Stacy.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.720]   Hot takes.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720]   - Yeah, just yeah, exactly.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.920]   - Silly me trying to get a considered opinion here.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.920]   - I'm not.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.920]   - I know.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:03.280]   - Okay, so I'm thinking about it from a public health standpoint.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:10.880]   It is obviously detrimental to have these closed groups and it is easier to share them
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   and spread them.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.080]   It's unlike in physical meetings, so it's much easier.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.640]   So is it closer to basically shouting fire in a crowded theater is the question we'd have
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.640]   to come up with?
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   Does that make sense?
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.840]   Because that would be the argument that I would use if I said you should shut it down.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:26.120]   - And that line refers back to...
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.680]   I don't know if it was a Felix Frankfurter.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:34.560]   A Supreme Court decision about free speech, that limited free speech only to cases where
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.560]   it doesn't...
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.200]   It's an all right to a bridge free speech in a case where it endangers lives.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.200]   - Right.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.400]   - And the example he gave was shouting fire in a crowded theater.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   So if it endangers...
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.400]   - Thank you.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.680]   - Well, maybe it didn't even need to give you that gloss, but just...
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.240]   - No, no, that was hell.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.560]   I was like, I did not have the reference point in front of me to explain all of that.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.160]   So who you would do it in?
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   - Yeah.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.040]   - So that is the question.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:06.640]   Is it that big of an endangerment for public welfare?
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.080]   - That was just as Holmes, I apologize.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.280]   Let's give him credit.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.480]   - So yes, so that's what I'm trying to think through, Jeff.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:23.960]   - So here's Stacy, what I think, if you're a Facebook and you face something similar in
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.640]   the Czech Republic, right?
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.200]   What you're going to try, what you're going to hope to say is government, you tell me
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.200]   what to do.
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.200]   If it's against the law, I'll do it.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.360]   If it's not, I'm leaving it, right?
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360]   Because that's what we do.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.400]   That's our policy here.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:45.160]   So in essence, but we don't want the government, I think, to outlaw even the first amendment
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.000]   protects lives.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.280]   The first amendment protects mistakes.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.280]   First amendment protects...
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.280]   - No, actually...
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.280]   - Actually...
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.280]   - It's a...
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.280]   - And I'm reading an article.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.280]   - It does not.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:11.160]   - In "In Instances of the Bible, Fronferturi" or Oliver Wender Holmes saying the most stringent
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:16.080]   protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely, that's the important word,
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.040]   they're shouting fire in a theater and causing panic.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:28.320]   So falsely is important, if it's false and it causes harm, it may not be constitutionally
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.320]   protected.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:36.000]   - Then we end up in a case where do we want Facebook and Twitter to decide what's false
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.560]   and true?
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.960]   Do we want them to pre-moderate everything that we all want to say?
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:45.040]   You know, 11 and 13 were bad, this is worse in a lot of ways.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.040]   - Okay, so...
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.040]   - I'm not sure if the alternative...
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.560]   - I think the end of Acts was a raffle, but I don't know what to do.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:54.680]   - Here's maybe a way out of it or maybe a thing that could happen.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:59.440]   Let's say my child gets the measles and as a result of it is death for the rest of her
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.360]   life and she was hearing.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.080]   And I view that as a harm.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   I could actually go after Facebook if I could...
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.000]   'Cause that is a tort situation where I could demonstrate harm.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.200]   If I could demonstrate it directly back to that group, like say my best friend didn't
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.160]   vaccinate their child, that's who I got it from and it was because of that group.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.600]   And I could find enough other people, you could get a class action or you could get
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:28.040]   a significant enough lawsuit that Facebook would then have to act to protect its own
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.120]   economic interests to avoid getting sued for something like that, right?
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:38.080]   I could say that it is a place that that coddled that group or made it possible for
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.760]   my child to get this disease that harmed her and thus I'm suing.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.840]   So that's one way we could go after it without the government technically going after it,
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:51.120]   but the government would be, as part of the lawsuit, we would be invoking the laws of
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.360]   this country, if that makes sense.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.440]   It's definitely, I'm really going down this rabbit hole.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:03.200]   There does seem to be a quite an important distinction between deliberately lying and
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.160]   unknowingly lying.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.160]   Yes.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:13.480]   And this goes back to the very famous Stolen Valor case of 2012.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.080]   It's actually, this is fast.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.680]   I would hate being a lawyer, but I love the law.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.920]   This is a case where a guy had a habit of lying.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   He said he played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:31.280]   He married a starlet from Mexico, but when he announced he had once held falsely, once
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:36.480]   held the Congressional Medal of Honor, he violated a federal criminal statute, the Stolen
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.680]   Valor Act of 2005.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.080]   And knowingly is the key here.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.840]   What was the final decision?
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   That's the question.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.640]   I have to read this whole thing to find out what the court held on this.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.960]   Do you know, Carsten, you went to Harvard?
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.480]   Do you actually read things like us?
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   Did they come?
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.480]   Was it Harvard Law School?
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.480]   No, no.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.920]   I figure Harvard's Harvard, right?
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.760]   If he went to Harvard Law School, would he be working with us?
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.520]   He'd be rich, I tell you.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.520]   The judgment of the court is affirmed.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.600]   The nation well knows, this is Justice Roberts writing, this is only in 2012.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.760]   The nation well knows that one of the costs of the First Amendment is that it protects
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.800]   the speech we detest, as well as the speech we embrace.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:26.400]   Though few might find the respondent statements, anything but contemptible, his right to make
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:32.520]   these statements is protected by the guarantee, the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.520]   speech protection.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:39.800]   The Stolen Valor Act infringes upon free speech.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.800]   It's overturned.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.000]   What's interesting about this, I'm going to give you another law case right now.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   They did not prove harm.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   They did not prove harm, is that why?
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000]   Yes.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.880]   That should be the theme of the show, all the proving of harm.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.560]   Yeah, well, you know what that's important?
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.520]   That's a very important legal standard, right?
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.800]   It's you can't say, well, it's just wrong.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.400]   You have to show harm.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.400]   You can't say it could happen.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.400]   I'm going to say this is related to you.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.400]   Did you know that off the top of your head, Kirsten?
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.400]   Hi, Google, very quickly.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.400]   Okay, I was going to be very impressed.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:12.400]   Your chance, you'd still be asking what happened because you couldn't get to Google.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   Yes, good.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:27.400]   Yes, in the case of the Bezos National Enquirer, a fair number of legal pundits on the air,
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.080]   we're saying, well, I don't know if it's, if you can actually charge a bribery and extortion
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.120]   in this case because they didn't ask for money.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.360]   So one of the great things about being in the green room at MSNBC is I get to ask the
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.360]   lawyers their questions.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:41.000]   So Chuck Rosenberg, who I think is phenomenal.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.640]   And I said, I said, I explained this to me, Kelsey, and he's a former U.S. attorney prosecutor.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:53.680]   And he said, well, actually, so the problem is that the bribery extortion definition of
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.120]   value, of stealing value is limited.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:04.080]   But he said in the stealing government property statute, there's a broader definition of value
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.640]   and it includes intangible things.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:19.560]   So by seeking to get Jeff Bezos to give up the journalistic value of the Washington Post
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.920]   was am I trying to extort value out of him?
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920]   Interesting.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.480]   So it's the same as stolen valor, and by that notion of stealing valor, valor, and thus
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.480]   value.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.280]   I mean, you're right, this lot of that.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.600]   I was going to go to law school too.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   I'm very glad I didn't.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.160]   I would have a real tough time saying, yes, your honor would not work well.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.160]   You could not be good.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:42.280]   I'd be under contempt all the time.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:45.600]   I'm warning you, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.480]   One more outburst in this court.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.480]   Let's take a little break.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.920]   When we come back, our Google change log, of course, we have our picks.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.160]   Ward, Carsten, that's no fun.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.680]   Now he's going to be ready.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:00.840]   Oh, with a button.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.840]   I still don't know.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:03.440]   Yeah, that's no fun.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.640]   I'll throw on something in this tractor.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.640]   I'll throw on something in this tractor.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.080]   We all know how important VPNs are, right?
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:16.320]   If you don't, a VPN, a virtual private network, encrypts your traffic from your device, your
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:23.120]   phone, your computer through the internet service provider, through the carrier, past
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:29.520]   the guy in the hoodie in the corner of the coffee shop, out into the world, to the VPN
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.760]   server and then, and to the public.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:36.040]   It's a great way to protect your privacy and security when you're online.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.760]   Lots of people don't want to know what their internet service provider to know what they're
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:39.760]   up to.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.760]   They don't, for good reason.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:44.320]   Nowadays, we know that our carriers are selling our information.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.920]   Does anybody, including bounty hunters, if you don't want dog the bounty hunter to know
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.200]   what you're up to, a VPN is a great choice.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.560]   But choosing the right VPN is very important.
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:59.200]   There are bad VPNs, virtual private networks out there.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.320]   There are VPNs, for instance, that spy on you and sell that information.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.320]   Yes.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.000]   There are VPNs that insert ads into your VPN stream.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.280]   I use ExpressVPN because I can trust it.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.720]   It's the number one VPN service.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:14.600]   And it's not just me saying so tech radar.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.920]   Lots of users voting.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:19.000]   This is the one Express VPN, no logging.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.240]   They don't track your anything you're doing.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.120]   They don't save any information about what you're doing online.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.120]   They are very fast.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:30.560]   The other thing, a VPN can slow you down if they don't have enough servers, enough bandwidth.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.120]   ExpressVPN does.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.520]   In fact, they've servers in 160 locations.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.360]   There's a list on the website just all over the world.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.640]   There's another benefit to that because you technically don't emerge into the public internet
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:47.560]   until you come out of their VPN server, which means you could be in England.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.680]   You could be in Singapore.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.280]   You could be anywhere in the world.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.840]   It's really awesome.
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:54.200]   No more geographic restrictions.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.680]   And the speeds are fantastic.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.640]   No compromises to be secure.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.880]   That's important too.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.960]   Apps for Windows, Macintosh, iOS and Android, one click apps to you.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.160]   Push a button.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.240]   You're secure.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   So it's very easy to turn it on whenever you need it.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.920]   Turn it off when you don't.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.720]   And it's less than $7 a month.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.120]   It is exactly what you've been looking for.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:19.720]   Look no farther than ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.920]   Don't forget 30-day money back guarantee.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:27.080]   If any of this doesn't work for you, no problem, no hassle, you're never going to need it though.
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.360]   I can tell you right now.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.840]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.000]   You're going to get three extra months when you sign up for a year.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.280]   Get the one-year plan, which is a very good deal as a result.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.840]   And you'll get an extra three months, which make it even better.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.680]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.280]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:53.280]   Oh, we have so many fun stories.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.520]   I don't even know where to go next on this one.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.680]   Amazon launching a private label cosmo.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   Oh my God.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:04.400]   It's he surprised me.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.160]   You will do the show.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.600]   You will do the change log.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.600]   Investing it.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.360]   Well, thank you, guys.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.360]   Well done.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:15.280]   I tried to trick him.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.040]   He tricked me.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.200]   I was going to say, I don't know what we should do next.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.320]   Maybe we should do the change log.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.720]   No, no, he was not fooled.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.440]   Well done, Sundar Pichai and the Google keyword blog.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.480]   You don't see a lot of posts from Pichai in the keyword log.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:40.000]   In this case, investing across the US in 2019.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.080]   Sundar starts one year ago this week.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:47.080]   I was in Montgomery County, Tennessee to break data.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.080]   He is.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.080]   Look at this.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.280]   2019 Google offices and data centers.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.360]   New developments circled, existing developments, blue dots.
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.120]   It's all over the place.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.120]   24 states.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:02.800]   They're going to have offices and facilities.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.040]   Are offices mostly sales offices?
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.160]   No, they spread development around to a lot of offices.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.160]   New York is huge.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.160]   They put development a lot.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.160]   I think Austin does.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.160]   They have stories here.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.160]   Two big buildings.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.160]   They also want to grab college talent.
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.160]   I think we're as a Carnegie Mellon.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.160]   What's more called?
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.160]   Help me out here.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.160]   Pittsburgh.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.160]   Pittsburgh.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.160]   Thank you.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.160]   Harvard man knows it all.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.160]   Who needs.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.160]   You live in Europe.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.160]   Wikipedia is gone.
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:36.160]   Google's gone.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.160]   Google's gone.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:46.160]   Get yourself a Harvard man.
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:51.160]   Get yourself a Harvard man.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.160]   That's my motto.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:36:01.160]   I wonder where they're putting their customer service back office, phone stuff and five offices
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.160]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:10.160]   We're going to have 14 states, 10,000 new construction jobs in Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma,
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.160]   South Carolina and Virginia.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.160]   As you said, 24 states, data centers and 13 communities.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.160]   29 centers don't create a lot of jobs once a construction is done, do they?
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   No.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   There's some good IT jobs there, but that's about it.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   And the robots.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.160]   The robots love them.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.160]   2019 marks the second year in a row.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:34.160]   Google will be growing faster outside of the Bay Area than inside it.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.160]   Good.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:41.440]   Do you think that's a response to Amazon planning the story that now that New Yorkers are being
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:45.160]   such jerks about it, maybe they won't put their headquarters in Queens?
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.160]   No.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:54.160]   I mean, I think it's definitely a refutation of Amazon's quote HQ2 kind of debacle.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.160]   It's getting worse.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.160]   That is.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.160]   Well, Amazon, I'm going to say it right now.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:04.160]   I mean, this Amazon, you could be in heaven, move across the river to Newark, New Jersey.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.160]   New York.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.160]   I'm serious.
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.160]   New York needs you.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160]   It has the facilities.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.160]   You would make a real difference there rather than New York City.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:13.160]   Either I love New York City too.
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.160]   Audible has already headquartered there.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.160]   There's a great airport there.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.160]   All the same facilities and efforts.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:24.160]   You have it's far better to take the move across the river and we will embrace you in New Jersey.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.160]   Take the path.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.160]   You'll be in town in minutes.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.760]   They're path or NJ transit.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.760]   Either one takes you in.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.760]   It's fine.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.560]   I will say Google's move is smart because it puts them across larger number of congressional
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.560]   districts.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.560]   Oh, true that.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.560]   Oh, that is so.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.480]   So why give them lobbying money when you can give them jobs?
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.240]   I mean, that would be something to think about.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:52.760]   I would think if I were a marketing company and put it against Trump districts.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:53.760]   Mm.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.960]   Didn't look like it was very Trumpy.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.960]   That could be wrong.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.960]   The places that tend to be Trumpy are probably not the places that Amazon would go.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.960]   Hey, you guys are so prejudiced.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.960]   Sorry, Google would go.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:07.960]   Oh, frat, you too.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.360]   Well, no, Google would for a data center.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:13.240]   Your mode is fun.
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.360]   And Amazon would for a warehouse.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.860]   I am.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:20.960]   Is Texas not a blue state?
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.760]   So it is not.
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:23.760]   A red state.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.760]   I get those.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.760]   It is a red state.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.040]   For the most time, Google didn't have operations.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:33.760]   They had very tiny operations because was a serger.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.360]   Larry was hated Texas because it was a backwards red state.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360]   Really?
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.760]   Yeah, it was a very big deal once Google opened back up in Texas again.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.960]   So three Googlers.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.560]   Three are nominated for Oscars.
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.560]   Actually one them.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.560]   These are the technical Oscars.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.960]   Of course, they don't get the TV exposure.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.960]   Not even really.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.920]   Leo, you could host the technical Oscars.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.960]   Do a deal and then like bring those people on the show.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:06.960]   That would be so cool.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.560]   I would love to do that.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.760]   Yeah, call up who are.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.880]   Paul Debevec, Shwaming You and Wanchun Alex Ma and Timothy Hawkins.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.040]   Scientific and technical achievement awards for their work at the Institute for Creative
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.480]   Technologies USC.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.040]   That's where they worked before they went to Google.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.400]   Actually Debevec is still a adjunct professor there.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   They created the light stage.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.360]   This is pretty cool looking.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.840]   It's software which captures 3D models of an actor's face for visual effects.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:44.880]   That's Zoe Saldana doing her character in Avatar so she could do all the acting in that light
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.880]   stage.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.800]   It's pretty pretty pretty.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800]   Pretty pretty.
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:52.800]   Oh, I knew you were going to say that.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.320]   It is creepy.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.880]   Those faces?
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:05.280]   Look at here's the here's the Blade Runner 2049 visual effects using the light stage because
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.600]   as you may know, some of the characters in Blade Runner are a little older than they appear
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.720]   on screen.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:19.200]   They got to figure out a way to make them look young again.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:24.880]   She looks exactly as she did in the original movie Harrison looks a little older but see
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.360]   because Androids don't age.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:32.000]   So she actually looks.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.080]   See you can't cross the creepy line with an Android because they're already creepy.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.080]   They're Androids.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.320]   Harrison Ford's an Android too.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:43.040]   Shut up spoiler alert.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.680]   That's a big one.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:46.680]   Big one.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.640]   Big fat spoiler.
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:55.040]   You Harvard guys got you back for the change log and smart.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.440]   By the way, that is up for debate.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:01.040]   I don't think it's clear.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.040]   It's okay.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.800]   We got to stay close guys because I know you want to get this over with it's getting
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.000]   there encryption for everyone.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.960]   This we talked about extensively on security now records, Stacy.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.120]   No, stay in there.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.120]   I didn't.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.240]   I didn't know.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.360]   I didn't know what this was.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:23.360]   Adi Antom is a kind of I'll leave this to Steve to explain but clever crypto technique
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.840]   using cryptography algorithm called cha cha cha.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:35.320]   And it will make it easier to do encrypted devices for lower end Android devices without
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.240]   built in encryption hardware.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.720]   So that's very good.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:45.280]   And they named it Adi Antom, which is a maiden hair fern.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:47.280]   No reasons were given.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.280]   Sure.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   Okay.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:54.280]   You named your technology after a maiden hair fern.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.080]   Yeah, you got a problem with that?
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.080]   It sounds like Adam Antom.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.400]   That's what I my conjecture yesterday at security now was they wanted Adam Antom but
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:03.400]   they couldn't get it.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.520]   So they said, we'll take out a couple of letters.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.800]   We'll call it that.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:12.720]   Google is adding a add to wait list feature for restaurants.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.240]   It's provided by dine time as part of reserve by Google.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.240]   I didn't know reserve was a Google app.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:23.320]   I didn't know any of that.
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:29.240]   I use reserve because not everybody is open table.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:32.920]   Reserve with Google, which launched in 2016 allows users to book and paper reservations
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.920]   without leave.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.760]   Oh, this is not the reserve app or maybe it is, but this is built into Google service.
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:43.000]   So you can make a, I didn't know this, but you can make a reservation in Google search.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.560]   And now you can put yourself on a wait list.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:50.640]   If as is apparently the case, the red lobster in your neighborhood is booked.
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:54.880]   I don't even know you can make reservations at red lobster.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:58.280]   So that's just shows you what I know.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.920]   This is the Times Square Red Lobster.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.760]   So now you can add your name to the list.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.760]   Are you excited?
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.760]   No.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.760]   Not me.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.920]   You can best buy is now selling Google Fi data.
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.080]   I mean, phone Sims, not data Sims, phone Sims for 10 bucks, but you get 10 bucks credit
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.680]   on Google Fi.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:24.120]   So if you need a SIM card for your Google Fi, I wonder what the, what the other curious
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:28.200]   thinking about because they've got, they've got major investments in bus buy.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.200]   Absolutely.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.840]   Verizon and AT&T and so on and the whole McGill and now I'll take that phone and that card.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840]   Thank you very much.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840]   Goodbye.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.200]   Oh, that would be bad.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:37.200]   I guess that's the idea, right?
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.200]   That's what competition does.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.200]   It's great.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.200]   Yep.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.200]   I'm happy about it.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.200]   I imagine they're not, but I am.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.200]   There's a new encryption, I'm sorry, encryption.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:52.400]   There's a new API for automating Google Docs.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.600]   This sounds really cool.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.840]   Yeah, I found this one of the things like invoicing things you do over and over and over
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.840]   again.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:43:59.840]   It's just an action.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.960]   Well, you'd want, you'd want somebody to write it unless you're a developer, but they
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:08.880]   can use, developers can use the API to create tools that automatically do anything, almost
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.640]   anything you would do with the document, including reading and editing, existing docs,
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.240]   creating entirely new ones, lists, tables, images, all accessible.
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:23.520]   This is something Apple does really well with their automator and Apple script and apps
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.120]   on Mac OS.
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:28.360]   But if you're going to, I think if this is a great thing to have in the cloud.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:31.320]   Oh, way back in the day, I used to do mill merge.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.320]   Right.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320]   Right.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.960]   It is a restful API.
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:44.880]   If that makes you happy and that's that story and that I believe no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.200]   I just tried to screw with Karsten here, Stacy.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.200]   That wasn't nice.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.200]   Sorry, Karsten.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.000]   I just got a text from Kevin who's like, Oh, mg, how can there be nothing on the change
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.040]   log about Chrome OS 72?
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:06.760]   He has gone on and on in his on his website, his lovely website, which is called about
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:13.000]   Chrome books, but he told me two features, one of which, Jeff, you're going to super appreciate.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.160]   So the first one that nobody I am like, it's cool.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.000]   He has picture in picture now for Twig on the Pixel Slate.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.680]   So that's cool.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.880]   And then he is also excited because you can download.
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:25.880]   Hold on.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.400]   I got to do this.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.960]   I got movies and music to an SD card.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.160]   There you go.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.840]   Oh, this was your big complaint, Jeff.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.320]   And now it is solved.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.760]   And you can put it on a USB stick for you with your Pixel sleep.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:41.480]   And that's good because most Chromebooks don't have much storage.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.680]   You don't really want to fill up your limited storage.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.960]   I've got plenty.
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:52.000]   So so the advantage of that is that I can move the movie from one place to another.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.480]   Yeah, or you could just not fill up your internal storage.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:57.200]   You can just put movies on a US.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.200]   I'm like.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:00.360]   You're on a plane and you don't have a connection to the Internet.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.360]   There you go.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.360]   Right.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.280]   But I download that now onto my machine.
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.280]   He just puts it on the machine.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.360]   But there are a lot of Chromebooks with 16 gigs of storage.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.320]   Yeah, I have like 1064.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   Right.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320]   We're a month ago.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.320]   That won't get you across an ocean.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.880]   No, not into the anyway.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:24.840]   So it's so go into Chrome OS settings, navigate to the Play Store option, then choose manage
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:27.440]   Android preferences for some reason.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.520]   This opens the Android settings app just like on the Android phone from there you choose
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.520]   app notifications.
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.240]   It's like Google Play movies and the permissions option.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:41.400]   Enable the storage permission and you'll get a pop up from now on when you download, choose
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:44.080]   download storage internal or SD card.
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.080]   Cool.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:46.080]   But you know what?
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.080]   That was a lot of words.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:49.560]   Just go to the fabulous about Chromebooks.com.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560]   Fabulous.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.640]   So I have an oddity Kevin since you're watching.
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:58.400]   I have an oddity that and it's happens to me all the time because I'm on planes.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.080]   But for certain domains, not all like my school domain is fine all the time, but certain
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.720]   domains like going to United and I go to the United Club where I go on the United
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.720]   plane.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:14.400]   The Chromebook will not see the domain because it's new it in another life and I can't get
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.400]   in there to forget it.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:16.400]   I can't get anything.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:22.200]   I have to restart the machine for to recognize the domain is there and then it will learn
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:26.960]   Sean, which doesn't sound that bad except that when I'm in the air and I'm trying to
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:27.960]   connect to the Wi-Fi.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.960]   I did I have a problem?
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.440]   I gave a I got all I vase man.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:39.880]   This is a conversation we need to have Kevin so I can figure out what I'm doing wrong.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:42.080]   He is typing and he has no idea how to fix your issue.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:43.800]   He's going to look into it.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.560]   You failed me Kevin, but no, you won't.
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:46.560]   No, no, no, he's looking into it.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.560]   He's looking into it.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.560]   Nothing better than that.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:50.560]   Nothing better than that.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.560]   There you go.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.560]   There you go.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:54.560]   Okay.
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:59.480]   And I am I feel like I was just possessed by the spirit of Kevin TOEFL and now I'm going
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:05.280]   to like let his spirit and the virtue of the Chromebook comes down upon you.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.280]   Exactly.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:11.320]   It's the virtue of the Chromebook speaking of this shouldn't be in the Google change
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.560]   luck, but I'm putting it there anyway.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:20.600]   Samsung has started taking reservations for the galaxy 10 on their website.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:31.280]   And the only reason I mentioned that is because one week from today in 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.960]   Samsung is going to have its big galaxy 10 unveil and we will stream it live right here.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.920]   So you can order before it's unveiled.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:38.920]   You can reserve it before it's unveiled.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.920]   Yeah, I don't know what that gets you.
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:44.360]   You're basically rather than playing this race.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.440]   Well, I'm going to buy it.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.760]   You can always cancel.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:52.360]   It says you'll save up to $550 when you trade in an eligible device delivery by and this
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.040]   is actually news March 8th.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.520]   So we now know that March 8th these galaxies will arrive and you get it first with early
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.480]   access to pre-order by doing what I just did.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.360]   Oh, and I get a $50 in credit on accessories.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.160]   So thought I mentioned that and we will be covering that stream where we're going to

[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.800]   And I'm sure we'll be talking about that.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.760]   We start before six.
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:23.760]   Yes.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.760]   Promise.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.320]   Oh, this affects us.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.640]   I'm like dosing off here.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:29.640]   Not really.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:30.640]   No, okay.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:35.560]   No, because they started 11 if they're not they don't they'll be done by noon.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.800]   In fact, if you want, we can start early next week.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.800]   How about that?
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.720]   I don't know.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:45.480]   Well, we'll be in touch and that concludes.

[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:55.880]   No, I didn't know this time.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.920]   Did you Jeff made a funny sound?
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.560]   No, he just went, but okay.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.600]   This show was delighted that we were there.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.280]   We are there and now we're going to take a break.

[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:12.760]   It's true.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.200]   We will wrap this show up with a fine breakfast taco.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.160]   No, I didn't mean to do that.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.160]   That was cool.

[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.160]   Stop.

[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:56.280]   I like it for maybe for April fools.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.280]   That's true.
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:58.280]   There you go.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.360]   You're like, "Mm, Stacey's so chill."
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:01.360]   No, she's--.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:02.360]   Okay.
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:07.840]   My thing for this week is our review-- I have shameless self-promotion this week-- of the
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:15.520]   Hubitat, which is a privacy-centric smart hub, smart home hub with all the radios you
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:16.520]   need and--
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:17.520]   What's the name?
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.520]   Hubitat?
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:25.680]   Now, Kevin did the review because I'm leaving and I can't install crazy stuff at the moment,
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.560]   but the important thing to note that Kevin is a very generous reviewer and he hated this
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:36.120]   hub for anyone who was not a die-hard user of home automation software.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.040]   So many of your audience will appreciate this hub.
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:43.360]   It does not have a native app or it does not have an app at all.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.640]   It's basically you interact with it through a web browser.
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:46.640]   Oh, like the old days.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:47.640]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:55.160]   No, but it is not for your person who does not want to spend hours programming a light
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:57.560]   switch to turn on and off when you hit a button, right?
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:59.000]   Oh, no, that's our audience.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000]   You're right.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.760]   Well, that's why I was like, "Oh, they will love this hub."
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.040]   And what it does is it keeps everything local.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:10.800]   So if your internet goes out, you still have all your automations.
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:17.080]   If nothing, all your data from your devices stays on the hub, you actually do go out to
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.160]   AWS for the login.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:23.920]   So if you're Cashmere Hill, you're not going to like that.
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:30.800]   But for everyone else, this is a very privacy-focused hub and it's only $100, which is not a lot
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:31.800]   to spend.
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:32.800]   Nice.
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:33.800]   Very nice.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:34.800]   Oh, yes.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:35.800]   Sorry.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:36.800]   I like it.
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:37.800]   It is a wonderful hub.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:40.240]   I highly recommend that everyone choose it.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:42.960]   It's a beautiful, beautiful hub.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:46.040]   You've hypnotized me into body.
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.040]   Not you, Jeff.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.040]   Don't buy this.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:49.040]   You will hate it.
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.040]   It will give you a heart attack.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.040]   Please do not buy it.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.040]   It's too much for you, Jeff.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.040]   You're just not ready for it.
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.080]   Well, someday perhaps.
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.680]   I think the frustration would really just drive you nuts.
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:01.680]   Let's listen to it.
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:02.680]   No!
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:03.680]   No, no, no.
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.280]   Jeff, listen, listen, little Bob Ross.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.680]   It's going to calm you down.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.320]   Oh, my nephew's having a Bob Ross birthday party.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.320]   You're kidding.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:17.320]   How old is your nephew?
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:18.320]   No.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:19.320]   He's eight.
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.320]   He's the quirkiest kid.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:21.320]   I love him to death.
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.320]   Hello, I'm Bob Ross.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.320]   And I'd like to welcome you to the talk.
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:24.320]   He would his Bob Ross for Halloween.
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:25.320]   You're kidding.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.760]   He's an eight-year-old Bob Ross fan?
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:29.760]   Yes, it's adorable.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:30.760]   That's kind of great.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.560]   Another series of painting shows.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.280]   This is your first time with us.
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:37.600]   Let me extend a personal invitation for you to drag out your brushes, isn't it?
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600]   He's a little hyped.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:39.600]   He's a little hyped up.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:40.600]   Thank you.
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.600]   Bob is.
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:42.600]   He's a little overexcited right now.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:43.600]   It's a happy little picture today.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.280]   It's a happy little picture.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:47.760]   Jeff Jarvis, a number, please.
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.520]   Well, I was going to do this because I, earlier today this morning, I went to my calendar on
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.520]   Google and everything was an hour off.
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.520]   What?
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:59.440]   And I looked at my clock, which is, which has automatic daylight savings.
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:01.480]   I didn't already hit daylight savings time, and it was an hour off.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.920]   And I went online and somebody said, "Yeah, that happened to me in Australia last week."
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:06.960]   And somebody else had happened to me in Europe, but I think maybe it was just craziness.
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.960]   That's not my number.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.000]   Unless any of you out there found that you also had an hour off today, what happens to
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.160]   the world when Google changes time?
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.640]   I'll give you a time check.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:15.640]   It's 4.20.
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:16.640]   Thank you.
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.640]   So here's my number.
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:18.640]   Thanks, Elon.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:19.640]   Here's my number.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:20.640]   Thank you, Elon.
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:24.120]   A tribute to this is very sad.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:27.640]   This makes me extremely sad, but also very grateful for all we got out of it.
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.640]   Yes.
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.640]   Opportunity rover died.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:34.280]   Oh, the end of the line for the long-distance living Mars rover.
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:41.080]   Leo has on his screen a or Carson does a magnificent times graphic that shows the full
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:44.440]   route of the rover.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:50.320]   If you go through scroll, you'll see that it went something like 26 miles.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.320]   Keep going.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.320]   Keep going.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.320]   Keep going.
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:54.320]   There.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:59:04.080]   And then you see how opportunity neandered around Mars.
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:06.280]   Saving the world for us.
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:10.080]   Found evidence of water.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:11.960]   That's really nice.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:15.280]   And left something for the Martian to be able to get back to Earth.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:16.280]   Oh, really?
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:17.280]   Was it the world?
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:18.280]   Was it the opportunity?
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:19.280]   Oh, that's right.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.280]   Yes.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:21.280]   Was it?
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.280]   Was it?
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:23.680]   In the Martian, he went and got a nuclear reactor from one of the old rovers.
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:25.480]   I don't think it was.
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:26.480]   Was it opportunity?
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:27.480]   No, I don't think it was.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:31.680]   Well, he got that opportunity opportunity because it doesn't have a light.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:34.520]   If it had only had.
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:36.880]   He, Harvard does it again.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:37.880]   Again?
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:44.760]   Well, actually, actually that was carrying on sitting here.
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:45.760]   That's all I could do is mock.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:46.760]   That was jealous.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:49.320]   All I could do is mock his superior brain.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:51.320]   Well, I'm--
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:53.320]   There's its final rush to his spot.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:55.320]   I want to-- we were talking about my blog.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.960]   Perseverance Valley.
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:59.200]   Perseverance Valley.
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.200]   She persevered.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:02.200]   Aww.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:08.280]   We were talking about my blog and I don't know if anybody's noticed this.
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:17.200]   But of late, there's been this big button showing up on my blog that will read the post.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:22.440]   I was so excited when we launched the new screen savers three and a half years ago.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:24.800]   Since then, it's been one of my favorite shows in our--
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:29.360]   Now, I know people who have accessibility issues probably already have a screen reader.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.360]   And so maybe-- I don't know.
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:33.600]   You tell me, is this a bad idea or not?
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:36.280]   But this is an easy to install plugin.
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:39.200]   It doesn't work well with pictures.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:46.080]   But it will read your posts and you could choose the voice, male or a female voice.
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:51.560]   It's really, I think, kind of an interesting thing to have on your blog.
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:52.760]   And it's easy to install it.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:53.920]   This is a WordPress blog.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.240]   So I just added a block.
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:01.440]   Actually, I could log into my WordPress account and I will show you.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:06.560]   So what you do is a really simple thing to do.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.440]   See if WordPress lets me log in.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:11.000]   Sometimes they require me to answer an email.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000]   Nope.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.440]   Let me log in.
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:33.680]   So if I go to my site and I go to customize-- oh, now it wants me to log in again.
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:34.680]   This is the two factor.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:38.200]   You see, if Hank Green were doing this, he'd have a jump cut now.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.200]   Yeah, but I don't--
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:41.200]   But I can jump right now.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.160]   I don't do-- you just want to jump over to that case though.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:45.760]   I know what you're doing.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:46.760]   I am--
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.600]   What do you have for dinner tonight, Stacey?
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.200]   My husband made beef stew.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:53.080]   Ooh, a lot of stew fail.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.080]   Not really.
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:55.720]   A lot of stew.
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:59.720]   Well, we tried to fan for you in the sauce.
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:01.680]   I don't have the right phone with--
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:06.440]   I haven't made anything for myself apart from anything in years.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.560]   The other night I made kachua e pepe.
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.400]   Ooh, yum.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:10.160]   Oh, that's not hard.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.400]   Love that.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:12.080]   Well, it was good.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.320]   What is kachua e pepe?
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:13.800]   Sorry, sorry.
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:14.960]   Tell me, tell me.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:18.440]   It's just pasta and cheese and pepper.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.600]   It is-- it is-- no, no garlic.
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:21.360]   No, don't dare.
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.560]   You don't put garlic in yours?
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:23.560]   No.
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:24.440]   No, no, no, no.
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.760]   Simplicity.
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.640]   It's the calm of pastas.
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.520]   It's macaroni and cheese for grownups.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:32.720]   OK.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:33.440]   It's excellent.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:34.160]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:34.840]   Sounds delicious.
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:36.080]   Love kachua pepe.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.360]   Sounds like a treat.
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:38.400]   Have you done it yet?
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:40.680]   We're trying to vamp for you here.
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:42.120]   No, I don't have the--
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:43.840]   I don't have the phone with the authenticator on it,
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:46.080]   so I can't go in there.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.680]   Never mind.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:50.840]   Forget I even said anything.
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:52.600]   I will-- I'll point you to the website.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:53.680]   That's probably the--
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:54.760]   I'm-- I thought I didn't have the--
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:55.440]   Yeah, let's do that.
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:56.160]   Yeah, I'll point you.
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.760]   No, let's just tell us the website so we can go.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:00.760]   No, no, let's focus.
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:03.320]   Well, OK, but now I've got to find the website.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:05.240]   It'll be a minute or two.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:06.800]   Hold on just a second here.
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:14.640]   This wasn't as well prepared as I thought I would be.
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:17.280]   No, really?
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:19.160]   What if we just show them instead how
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:21.440]   to blur our backgrounds on screen?
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.760]   Whoa.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:23.280]   There it is.
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:23.880]   Is that it?
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:28.560]   No, that's a plug-in.
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:30.360]   This one is like-- I wanted to mention this
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:33.520]   because it's really--
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:34.440]   It looks very cool.
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.320]   Like, I would like to add something like that.
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:39.400]   And it's kind of-- it's kind of feel like--
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:40.760]   Just do it now.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.360]   Do it now.
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.920]   I feel like it's kind of like a nice contribution to--
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:48.880]   but I can't remember where it is.
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:50.240]   And now I forget it.
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:50.680]   I just--
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:52.240]   I shouldn't get credit for this because Stacy's
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:53.640]   the one who figured out how to do it.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:55.160]   How to do what?
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:55.680]   Leave.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:55.880]   What we're doing--
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:57.840]   Oh, what the hell?
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.600]   Stacy, you look so romantic.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:05.000]   Stacy has turned on a feature that is now
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.840]   available in Skype if you have the latest version on Windows
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:10.000]   or she's on Mac.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.160]   It doesn't work all that well.
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:12.760]   Look at her microphone.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:15.240]   Jeff, it looks a little bit better.
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:16.240]   But I'm still pink.
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.000]   Yeah, and if you move, it's like you're racing the blur
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.360]   with your head and it comes back later.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:28.160]   That is wild.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.640]   That is truly, truly wild.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.760]   So it blurs everything but the human being.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:35.040]   You audio people see what you're missing.
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.960]   Yeah, no, you're not actually audio people.
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:37.480]   Guess what?
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:40.400]   You are really not missing anything.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.840]   Yeah, you are not.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:43.240]   This is--
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.200]   Stacy, Stacy, you're muted.
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:48.840]   So I will show you real quickly.
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:51.440]   That stalling has given me the moment
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:56.440]   I needed to find website voice.com, which
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:00.400]   is a free service that will put that little bug on your website.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.680]   And it's really easy to add.
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:04.880]   You just copy the embed and install it.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:07.880]   You have to register your website with them.
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:09.080]   And I think it's really nice.
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:12.760]   Now, you're putting a plug-in on your site.
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.880]   That means they're going to know who's visiting your site.
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:16.720]   So you might want to think about that.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:20.800]   But it supports Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Norwegian,
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:23.040]   Korean, many, many voices.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.560]   You can customize it very easily.
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:25.680]   And it's very easily installed.
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:28.040]   At least on that WordPress site, it took me literally
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:29.600]   about a minute.
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:34.200]   So website voice.com.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:38.680]   You could see the customization thing right here.
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:42.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, blurry or not, we have come to the end.
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:44.960]   It's queso time.
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.920]   Come to the end of this show, and Stacy couldn't be happier.
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:49.360]   Stacy is stewing.
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:50.560]   She's so happy.
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:52.000]   Stu is waiting.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.840]   Stacy Higginbotham is at stacyoniot.com.
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:57.640]   She does a great podcast with Kevin Tofel about the internet
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:58.920]   of things.
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:00.960]   She's @Gigastacy on Twitter, and she
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:04.000]   is a much appreciated regular on this show.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.880]   As is our friend, Jeff Jarvis, who's
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.160]   been here since the very beginning.
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.200]   How many episodes now?
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:11.120]   495.
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:13.520]   We're going to have a party at 500.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:16.120]   Yeah, we're getting close to 10 years.
[02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:16.880]   Searching nine years.
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:17.480]   Are you serious?
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:18.960]   Yeah.
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:20.640]   Isn't that a wild thing?
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.800]   Isn't it hard to believe?
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:23.640]   You're sick of me, you're a boss?
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.600]   Not at all.
[02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:26.880]   You know we had Gina Trappani on Twitter on Sunday.
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:27.240]   I know.
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.920]   I haven't watched you, and I want to watch--
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.200]   Because it was Gina and Matt and--
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.720]   Matt cuts and then Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:36.800]   It was such a great show.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.960]   And Matt's an old timer on this show, too.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.880]   By the way, now officially administrator,
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.240]   no longer acting in Millistrater.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:42.800]   Really?
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:43.440]   Yeah.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:47.280]   Officially administrator at the US Digital Services.
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:52.320]   Our 10th anniversary of this week in Google is August 1, Jeff.
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:54.160]   So get ready for a party.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:56.480]   And it was you and Gina and me.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:57.560]   And nothing.
[02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:00.160]   And a dog named Korgi.
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.640]   No.
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:02.440]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:03.080]   Go away.
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:04.280]   Go, go, go.
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:05.000]   Please go.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000]   Everybody, go home and have dinner.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.680]   We're done here.
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.440]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.480]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:13.120]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 130 Pacific,
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:14.840]   430 Eastern.
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:16.280]   That's 2,130 UTC.
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:19.720]   You can watch it live, twit.tv/live, audio and video.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:21.320]   So you can listen live, too.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:23.120]   Or download a copy of the show.
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:25.000]   Going all the way back to episode one,
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.160]   just go to twit.tv/twig.
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:30.600]   To episode one is twit.tv/twig one.
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:34.960]   And then episode two is twit.tv/twig two, and on and on and on.
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:36.720]   And of course, we didn't have video in those days.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:38.360]   It was audio only.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.880]   But we did have the same lame music beginning this show.
[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:46.160]   So you'll be glad to hear the piper piping in this week in Google.
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.480]   Subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.480]   That way you'll get it every week, the minute it's available.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:51.720]   I am Leo LaPorte.
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:52.480]   Thanks for being here.
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:55.040]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.080]   Now go have some case up.
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:56.440]   Bye-bye.
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:59.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:02.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:05.060]   (upbeat music)
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:06.520]   (ghorn)
