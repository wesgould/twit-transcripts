[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   Coming up next on this week in Google, I'm Jason Howell, joining Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.360]   We talk about a whole lot of random Google. Basically, Bill Nye is hawking Chromebooks.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.160]   The Pixel Boss got a new job. Incognito mode is still in publishers' crosshairs, gestures.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720]   Are they the way to go? Or maybe something else? Maybe the three buttons?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.240]   And what exactly is the purpose of YouTube mods? All that more coming up next on this week in Google.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   NetCasts you love.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.880]   From people you trust.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.880]   This is Twig.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   at the podcast movement. They're throughout the week, so I'm happy to be here.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.880]   I always love joining. Joining me today, of course, Stacey Higginbotham, creator of the IOT podcast at IOTpodcast.com
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.880]   and the Internet of Things newsletter, Stacey on IOT.com. How are you doing Stacey?
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880]   I'm doing well. Thank you.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   Yeah, it's good to see you again. And then, and I have this sheet that John gave me to introduce our other esteemed host, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   Yeah, I don't have this memorized. The Leonard Tout Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Neumart Graduate School
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   at the University of New York and the director of the Tout Night Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   at the Craig Neumart Graduate School of Journalism at the University of New York.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   That happens every time, right? Every time you do the show with Leo?
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   No, no, no. Just when he wants to make fun of me.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   Oh, he calls me a fool. He got pretty.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   That is impressive.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   Whatever I just read, I don't understand a word of it. Whatever it is, that's impressive.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   It's, it's fine. It's nice people gave us money to do things, which is great.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   Right on. Good to see you guys again.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   Let's see here. And of course we have, we have Karsten on the ones and twos back there.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   Hello. He's on the turntables.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   Wait, what does the ones and twos mean?
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.880]   I think zeros and ones, I guess, would, would be more technologically appropriate.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   But the ones and twos, like, if you're going out to the club, you got turntable number one and turntable number two, they're the ones that the two.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.880]   That's Karsten.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   Oh, I am.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.880]   Yes.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   Okay, maybe not.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   Two turntables and a microphone.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   Yes, basically.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880]   Something like that.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   Seven million buttons and a microphone.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   Yes, seven million glowing buttons.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   Where do we begin as relates to Google this year?
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   Did you guys read the, the, what is it?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   What is it? It's on Wired, the piece about three years of misery inside of Google, the happiest company in technology.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   Natasha Tiku wrote this feature for Wired.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   She spoke with 47 Google employees, past and present, to kind of get a sense of the temperature and, you know, the, everything that's happened over the last three years.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   All the changes that Google's gone through.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:18.880]   And, I don't know, I thought it was just a fascinating kind of look insider look at how Google has maneuvered some of the fires and everything that I think, you know, initially Google's been a very ideological company, very open to sharing perspectives and keeping the company is open and welcoming as possible.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   And the last three years have forced Google into many different corners where it's really challenged that ethos.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   And the article does a great job walking through it.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   It does.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   And it also, it does a good job of pointing out what I imagine is kind of a microcosm of many thing, what's happening in many companies since the Trump presidency with kind of the polarization of society.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   And, you know, Google is just getting it worse because probably its role it plays as a platform.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   The culture it has about being yourself and speaking out that a lot of tech kind of companies have.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   So, I don't know.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.880]   And also that whole "don't be evil" thing that I know it's abandoned but still is associated with Google.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:18.880]   Yeah, whether Google wants to shake it or not, whether they think they're moving on from that or not, that will always follow them around.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.880]   And, you know, maybe it should.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   Maybe it helps to kind of keep them honest as far as that's concerned.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.880]   But anyways, if you haven't read the article, it's a long piece.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.880]   It's a feature piece for Wired.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.880]   So, it's going to take some time to get through.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.880]   But it really kind of focuses on, you know, James DeMoor and the kind of shift that that forced.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   Or rather, I think what that did is that kind of illustrated the voices inside Google weren't as, you know, as all on the same side of the page as maybe even Google imagined it was.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   You know, all of the internal kind of message boards and the activity happening there.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   And that, you know, finally, there were eventually people from the inside who were willing to kind of go to war against Google from the inside and make all that stuff public and how that's forced Google to kind of change its ways.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   And, I don't know.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   It's not an easy problem for Google, I think.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.880]   I don't think it's an easy problem for the country.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   I mean, if we're going to be real, I think this is it.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   This is happening everywhere.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   But yes, they get it worse because, well, you kind of see the same thing.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   If they could figure this out internally, they probably could apply it across.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   They could use those insights to, you know, help, I don't know, deal with YouTube results and filter various other services so we get less like reactive and content designed to, I don't know, engage people in things like white supremacy
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   and less reflective thought.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   I'm kind of babbling.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.880]   I'm going to stop.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   Let's move on.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   Let's move on from this story.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   It's probably a better read than anything.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   So go ahead and check it out.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   Let's see here any competitive stuff.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.880]   Like when I was going through the run now for this, I was like, what is like the major Google news right now?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   And I feel like I'm having a really hard time pointing my finger on like what major has happened with Google this last week.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   So I feel like it's a bunch of little random pieces here and there.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   It's August.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   That's what happens in August.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:37.880]   And I would say, like, I would love, I don't know if Jeff's really excited to do this, but I wanted to talk about the search engine auction mostly because they don't understand it.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   All right.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   Let's do that.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   I don't fully understand it either because there's an angle in here.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   There's a weird twist in here, which is that the regulators came after them and said, you just can't, you know, become more like a person.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   Become doing on your own or decide what to do on your own.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.880]   So you have to do something and it has value.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880]   It's not like they should give it away.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   Right.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.880]   It has big value.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.880]   We should start with what's actually happening because I think we talked about it a little last week.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   And this is over in the EU.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   So they announced last week, Google announced last week in response to the whole $5 billion fine by the EU was part of the antitrust violation ruling that it would hold closed auctions for searching for the new.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.880]   And it's very similar to if people remember the Microsoft browser ballot.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.880]   Right.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   Very similar.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:44.880]   You basically, you get a list when you first, when you like very first download an open Chrome, you get a list of which, who do you want to be your search provider?
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.880]   Do you want Google?
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   Do you want DuckDuckGo?
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   And so Google has decided to have an auction for like the top however many slots on this thing.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:11.880]   And strangely enough, it's competitors are somewhat averse to paying them to be on this list.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.880]   Right.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   Ecosia is one of the browsers and they are calling it unethical and a competitive in itself.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   DuckDuckGo is also a good one.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   DuckDuckGo is also the first one you just listed on the news.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   They're so European, they use much of their profits to plant trees.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   Right.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   They're mad.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   So when you first open Chrome, this pop up will show up.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   They could pay in carbon credits.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.880]   That would be cool.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   Google doesn't want to get the credit.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   What has value?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   Carbon credits help value.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   Okay.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   Keep going.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   That's true.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   So that would appear.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   And Google said when it announced this news, it would take the top three bidders in any given market.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   And basically those top three bidders would end up in that menu by default, ordered at random.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   Google thinks that's a fair solution because as you mentioned, this sort of selection has
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   some sort of value.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:25.440]   Browsers like Ecosia and DuckDuckGo and definitely some of the smaller players in the field are
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.800]   saying that this just kind of pushes them out of contention, right?
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.880]   The bigger search engines with the money that they're making can't compete with a browser
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.760]   like Ecosia that is like an alternative that focuses on privacy and special causes, especially
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.680]   like you said, planting trees in the case of Ecosia.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.680]   So they can't--
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.640]   Explain this to me too, Carsten.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.200]   Google can't be the default search anymore.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.560]   The user every time has to pick a default search engine.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   Wait.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.400]   Well, this is only if you opt out of Google.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.720]   This is when you first download Chrome in the EU.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   Right.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   You're setting up your Android phone.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.800]   You're setting up your Android phone exactly.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.600]   You'll get this.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.800]   So Google just-- the fact though is not the default choice.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   Exactly.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.760]   That's kind of-- I think that's kind of ridiculous on its face.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.760]   But--
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.680]   Well, but then the EU disagrees with you.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.080]   I know.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:30.520]   But that's a fairly major restraint of trade for an American company on its own.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:38.440]   They did the same thing to Microsoft in the early 2000s with the browser ballot.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   So this is--
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.920]   Yeah, that did all the kinds of good.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:49.800]   Well, this is what happens when you close the door after-- what is it?
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.880]   You close the barn after the horses go to Volcanic.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.880]   Well--
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.040]   It's hit the horn of the horse of the rear end, yeah.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.680]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.920]   I wish-- I mean, I do like using alternative browsers.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.120]   But sometimes-- you know, my default is always to try to use a different browser
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.200]   and then to go back.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.280]   But most people don't have time for that.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.440]   You really shouldn't make them.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.160]   To be clear, this is not about browsers.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.600]   This is about search engines.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.560]   That's what I mean.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.440]   I keep saying browsers and I'm envisioning type names.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.520]   I see a lot of people make that mistake.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.280]   But it's not--
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   Right.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:36.480]   So very specifically, if you're using Google or DuckDuckGo or Bing or one of the search
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   engines.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:44.080]   Yeah, I'm curious to know how this interplays into Android, like into the home screen and
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   stuff.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:51.120]   You know, you can choose on the home screen different-- I was futzing around with my settings
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.640]   at some point in time.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.680]   And I realized I can turn my search bar into a different search engine on my--
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.720]   You mean the Google search bar on the home screen?
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.200]   No, you can probably do that in settings.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.760]   Yeah, actually references.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.440]   I'm like, you know how sometimes you're just messing around on your phone and you get
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.760]   something and you're like, whoo.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.920]   Oh, well, yeah, there's a reminder.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:22.600]   Now that I think about it, search bar-- yeah, I'm not really quite sure what that search
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   g port now.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.400]   You're way of ahead of me.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   I'm like, where is the settings icon?
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   Yeah, I can play.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   Pull down the shade.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.640]   Which way do I pull up to help left?
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.920]   Also my search foo of settings is not working for me right now, so I'm not able to get to
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   it.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   But I think you're absolutely right.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.480]   There is a way to go in there and change that.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.800]   Now, does each search engine have to provide something in order to appear there or is it
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   just-- I don't know.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   I don't know.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   I don't know.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   I mean, it does the code show.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   This is something I just literally ran across.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   I'm like, where did I find that again?
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   Let's go.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   Yeah, I'm just kind of curious.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.760]   Like, a cosia, you know, if they're a lower-- like, if they have far less money than most
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.920]   other search engines, let's say, to develop these features, is this a feature that they
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.480]   actually need to develop in order to be compatible with it?
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.640]   Or is it just-- we have a search engine, therefore, it can surface there.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.840]   I'm not really quite sure.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.320]   But that could be another obstacle for them, I suppose.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.000]   Or do not know.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.640]   Maybe it was in Google Assistant or the Google-- there are so many freaking Google things.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.040]   Anyway, do not get me started on that.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.360]   Indeed.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.760]   So many Google things.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:42.000]   But also antitrust related 23 job findings search sites in Europe are calling for an
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.840]   order by the EU to stop Google from anti-competitive behavior on that front.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.840]   They're charged--
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.640]   What's their specific allegation of anti-competitive behavior?
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.640]   They say that Google's job search widget, something that appears at the top of search
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:03.560]   results for relevant job search terms, is unfair when compared to the marketing investment
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.640]   that competitors have to spend to do the same thing.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.800]   And also, you know, that it only surfaces certain job sites within that tool, others
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.640]   get pushed down further, that sort of thing.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:25.680]   Now, of course, the consumer argument here is that Google is making it easier to find
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.560]   jobs directly and to not have to go through 40 different places.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.160]   And they have the data and they do it.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   So this is a-- there's commerce involved here.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.840]   But whether you're looking for-- you know, when was Michael Jackson born or you're looking
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.680]   for a job, there's data at the ready and Google's philosophy is to try to get it to
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.280]   you more than not.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   Right.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:52.120]   And I think part of their complaint is at least the sites that are calling for this order are
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.600]   saying that the tool requires the sites to follow a specific format in order to be involved
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   in this tool.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.400]   And some of them, you know, might not have the capacity to build out that format or don't
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.360]   want to follow Google's specific format.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.440]   So as a result, their site ends up lower on results and they don't feel that.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.800]   They've already spent all their money on SEO optimization.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.120]   They don't want to spend any money on getting the format, right?
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.360]   Well, no, so I will say this is something I've noticed about Google that is beginning
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.920]   to frustrate me.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.760]   If I-- and I think I noticed it looking for hotels the other night.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.200]   It is-- or maybe it was restaurants.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   I don't know.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.240]   It's becoming more difficult to search for things like a restaurant near me or a hotel
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:42.040]   near this and get to the actual website of the entity I'm looking for.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.840]   Instead, I get sent to all of the sponsors coming in various different boxes on my--
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.880]   and usually this is on my phone, but it happens on the computer.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.080]   I was like, what is this computer thing I'm looking at?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.200]   It happens on the web, too.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.000]   And that is getting frustrating.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.280]   So I know Google needs to monetize, but I'm kind of to the point where I'm like, I just
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.960]   want to get to what I'm looking for, man.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.760]   And I want the actual source.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.600]   I don't want-- I want to go to American Airlines website.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.240]   I don't want to go to Expedia's website.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.440]   So I don't know.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.360]   This is just Stacey complaints about Google today.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.800]   I'm going to try to find something else.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.320]   I like it.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:23.840]   No, I like it.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.440]   Keep up the complaints.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.200]   There's probably plenty of ammo in here to complain about.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.640]   How do you feel about this Stacey?
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:39.480]   Incognito used to make it possible for you to go to publication sites and get free
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.880]   articles because you shouldn't be identified if you're running an incognito mode.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.200]   And then this became like a cat and mouse game where the sites figured out how to identify
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.960]   you even when you're in incognito mode that you are in fact incognito mode so they would
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.680]   turn it off so you couldn't get the free article.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.640]   Google published a change to Chrome.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.960]   I think this was like a couple of weeks ago.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.680]   That would allow for it again.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.160]   Google says, hey, we've made it more private.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.080]   It just came out in Chrome 76.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.400]   Our overall goal is to make incognito mode a private mode.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.560]   And as such, we've patched the whole-- our goal is not to give you the ability to get
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.760]   free articles, but that is the byproduct of being totally private and incognito change
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   your business.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.240]   Well, now New York Times is one example of finding another way to identify users who
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   are using incognito.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.720]   So this really is just kind of like a ping pong match back and forth.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.560]   Is that a-- is there a New York Times violation of privacy in some way there?
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.720]   Well, so this-- I don't know if it's a violation of privacy, but what it does do is it shows
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.240]   you how identifiable your digital footprint can be.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:57.920]   I think people are just so blasé about this, but the metadata associated with your devices,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:05.600]   the programs running on your devices, all of that comes through when even if they strip
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.280]   your IP address, for example, they get this information.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:16.560]   So maybe they can't identify Jeff Jarvis, but they can't identify computer blah, blah,
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.480]   blah, blah, blah, has shown up before.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:24.400]   And so-- and this is super common, and this is totally to be expected.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.800]   I actually took from this that dang, subscription business is super important at the times that
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.640]   apparently they're doing, I guess, a good job of converting people at the paywall.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.720]   So if you have an effective paywall and you've got, I guess, one of the two national publications,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.520]   you're probably doing all right.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.600]   Yeah, and I'm not sure that what the New York Times is able to do through this is to identify
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.160]   specifically-- X user is using it.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   I think what they're able to identify is the fact that when you're running in Cognito
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:03.600]   mode, it changes the way the file system API is used, and in this case, how much space
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   the file system is set aside for the file system API.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   And so the New York Times can identify that based on the visitor.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.640]   They can see what space has been set aside for this, and given that, they know that user
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.600]   is using in Cognito and therefore block them from the article, from what I guess.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.560]   So I guess it's the same as not answering the door to someone who shows up at your house
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.360]   in a ski mask?
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   Sure, yes.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   But it doesn't--
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   Might be your best friend, might not be.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.360]   Right.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.720]   But the New York Times does identify an IP address and in Cognito mode.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.120]   And I'm trying to take a circle of stances in which that can be subpoenaed and of any
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   danger.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   I don't know.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   Right.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   Nothing comes to mind.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.760]   But if it's just saying that this is a browser using in Cognito mode, then that's the ski
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   mask as opposed to-- that's that same guy wearing the purple Hokkadot it ski mask, which
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   is--
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.760]   And holding balloons.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760]   Yes.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.760]   It's definitely problematic.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.560]   I'm just going to say, if you're wearing a ski mask, I am not opening the door.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.280]   Yeah, I'm just safe to say.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.920]   Maybe not even on Halloween.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.480]   Okay, maybe on Halloween.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   No, I don't know, man.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.400]   That might just be a bridge too far.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.480]   You've just ruined Halloween for me.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.480]   Sorry.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   Sorry.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.480]   Sorry.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.840]   Now I know what not to dress up as if I'm coming over and trick-or-treating at your
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   place.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.840]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.040]   And my name is Jason, by the way.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:40.200]   So my history with Friday the 13th, it goes way back.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   Let's see here.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.880]   Oh, I was excited about this story.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.120]   Because Mario, are we talking about Mario?
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.120]   Mario.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   It's a him.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   Mario.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   I don't know how to pronounce his last name.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   Is it Keros?
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   Mario, Keros?
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   Keros?
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   He met him.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   He met him.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   And I don't know.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   Keros.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.040]   I don't know as his friends call him.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   VP and GM of Pixel Smartphone Business is apparently moving on, though staying at Google
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.960]   and in fact not just staying at Google, moving into a position working in Sundar Pichai's
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.960]   office.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.800]   So moving on up, for sure.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:22.240]   Rick Osterlo is going to take over the Pixel Smartphone Business for now.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.440]   But Mario, he's got a long legacy.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.080]   As far as Google's hardware is concerned, pretty much to the very beginning, he started
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.840]   in 2005.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.640]   He was involved with Google's phone hardware since the beginning.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.120]   So he started on the Nexus One.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.640]   Oh, I had one of those.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   You know, I know.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   Wasn't it nice?
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   Google TV.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.720]   It had the little rolly ball down at the bottom, which I'm happy that didn't stick around
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.000]   as a way of controlling our smartphones.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   But at the time it was neat.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.360]   But yeah, he was involved to Google TV, Chromecast, Google Wi-Fi, Google Home, Stadia.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360]   And yeah.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.480]   So you were excited about this, why?
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:06.600]   Well, I was excited, one, because I think it helps push hardware, which always has felt
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.400]   like an afterthought for Google.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.000]   It makes it feel like their hardware ventures might become more prominent and important,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.160]   which I'm excited about because I think, well, part of music's excited about it and part
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.000]   of music's kind of sad because it could be that they're following an Apple strategy
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.720]   of locking people in with hardware to services and Apple's is very much a buy our services
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.800]   are locked to our hardware.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.120]   So buy our hardware, whereas Google's, I think, will be, hey, a really cool assistant offerings
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.520]   and other things are all going to tie together in hardware.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   So for an optimal service experience, you're going to want to have the hardware.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.800]   But regardless, I think that's an important thing.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.040]   I think having your hardware and software tied together is probably going to get more
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:59.360]   important over time and with like IOT and ambient computing, as they like to call it.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.360]   And then, you know, Rick Osterlo seeing overseeing the pixel business.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.760]   I'd be curious if they brought someone else in for that.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.960]   I don't really know what they're going to do with pixel.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.560]   I always feel like, it's okay.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.560]   It's okay.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.160]   Come back to us, Jeff.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.720]   Don't do what you did to the Nexus seven.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   Don't do it.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   I like my pixels.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.960]   I don't think the pixels go in anywhere.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.720]   I don't think they're going anywhere.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.840]   I just worry about any shift.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.720]   I don't like change.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.240]   Well, and this would be a big change, right?
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.240]   Like the expectations for the pixel for pretty high.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.800]   Google has helped with that because they've confirmed.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.280]   Well, it's already set in stone, whatever that's going to be, it is.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.880]   Yeah, whatever it is, it is.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.000]   So does this potentially show a different strategic view or somebody want to control
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   a little bit or?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.560]   It's Rick in there.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.600]   So they're saying at least for now, but if they make Rick in charge of all of hardware
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.080]   and then they have this overarching view, you could see things and, oh, let's have fun
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.280]   and go on the conspiracy train.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.160]   Remember how they're building the Fuchsia OS, which is supposed to be a browser for
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.640]   everything?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.520]   You could maybe start seeing the tie-ins across devices that Google makes that could
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.480]   be more fun, like your phone being able to talk directly to your assistants somehow.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.920]   I know it talks to your sister over Wi-Fi if you want, but maybe it would be more automatic.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   And I know some people will hate this, but it could start to kind of create these cool
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.400]   context clues and have things that you need follow you from device to device or pop up
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.120]   on the device where it matters at that moment in time.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   And that requires a lot of integration that I don't think.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.000]   I mean, God, look, look at what's happening right now with G Suite and Assistant.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.920]   You're just like, yeah, all of their different units, not quite on the same page, which is
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.200]   just the longstanding story of Google.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.440]   And you see that coming together.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.920]   I mean, actually, at the end of this month, we're going to see the end of works with Nest
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.840]   because they've decided to tie all that in and give themselves a little bit more control.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.440]   So I mean, is this going to be awesome for every single end user out there?
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   No.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.360]   But is it going to make Google's life easier and also create this more unified vision and
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.960]   product strategy?
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   Probably.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   One hopes.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.800]   And I think Rick does a great job.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.400]   He did a great job with Motorola.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:34.720]   I feel like I've liked what I've heard about how he's working with the hardware division.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.240]   And I like the general direction of Google's hardware.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:47.840]   And you know, when you think about it, I guess to be fair, if you're Microsoft, things take
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.400]   years because everybody's got a coordinate with everybody else.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   We got to make all those work together.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.160]   No, no, no, no, we actually doesn't have to work together, but there's a show of it.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.400]   And Google is OK, you're doing that.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.400]   You're doing that.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.240]   We'll figure out the integration later.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.200]   That's a little unfair, but not fully.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.080]   No, they do.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.400]   They totally have different teams working on different things.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   And they put them out.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   And then they're like, oh, people like this.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.720]   We're going to keep it.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.920]   You know, let's build it.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   Let's build a bridge.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   People like this.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.840]   We're going to kill it, which is the other thing to do.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840]   Right.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.800]   I feel like when more people like it, they don't kill it.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.320]   I want to watch.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.520]   They don't call it just Jeff Jarvis like it.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   Kill it.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.720]   A lot of people liked feed.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.560]   OK, yeah.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   Or readers.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.920]   We're going to go into a lot.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.120]   We'd always come back around to read.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.040]   I want my new Pixelbook.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.360]   Yes.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.200]   With reader.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.040]   Yes.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040]   And LTE.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.640]   And LTE.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.840]   Not too much.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.160]   I'm not going to be greedy.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.800]   Just give me it because this one's
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.760]   starting to get a little wonky.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.120]   And I don't want to buy a machine.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.560]   And then two weeks later, find out
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.800]   the new machine's coming out.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.200]   Well, don't buy a machine until the beginning of November.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.800]   Yeah, you only got it.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.000]   That's a lot of months.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.800]   Only a couple of more months to wait for that.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.040]   We're already talking about pixels.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.640]   So let's talk about the other Pixel things here.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.560]   Somebody just posted in chat.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.320]   And I had missed this.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.720]   It was scooter I posted this.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.360]   If you have the original Pixel, apparently you
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.800]   can get up to $500 over a microphone issue.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.840]   That was happening with the original Pixel.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.080]   The claims are now open.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.320]   So if you're having some flaws with that microphone,
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.120]   well, meanwhile, this phone is three years old.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.520]   So not bad to get that money back.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.400]   And actually--
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.280]   It's even better than that.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:48.240]   You can-- if you had one of the very first Pixel or Pixel XL
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.280]   phones and you had microphone problems,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.560]   you can get up to $500.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:00.640]   If you merely owned the phone and had no problems whatsoever,
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.240]   you can still get $20.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.160]   But yes, yes, oh.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   All right.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:07.680]   So--
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.160]   Hey, $20.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.360]   And it's going to take--
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.240]   Your labor is worth $30 an hour.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.720]   If it's worth $10.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.280]   You're going to lose $10.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.160]   I'm going back through my old--
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.880]   if I had actually bought my original Pixel--
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.080]   Yeah, there's that.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.960]   And it hadn't been given to me by Leo.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.560]   I would be going back going through my receipts
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.800]   and getting that $20.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.360]   Apparently, Leo needs to get a car system
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.000]   that you were looking back trying to remember
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.080]   whether you had bought it.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.600]   Yes.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.120]   Well, I was--
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.160]   In the hopes of the $20.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.440]   I was trying--
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.440]   because I did actually physically buy it.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.920]   But then-- but it was with the Twit Company card.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.720]   So--
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.840]   I think Lisa would tell you to fill out the thing for the $20.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.480]   OK, I'll do that.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.280]   I'm just trying to get--
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.160]   I guess I'll probably have to give the $20 at least, though.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.000]   Well, yes, that's what she would say.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.160]   OK, fine.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160]   Fine.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   OK.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.440]   Do pay for Twit lunches on Wednesday without $20.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.360]   OK, for the other half.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.440]   It'll buy one and a half pizzas.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:11.960]   That's right.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   That's right.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.240]   Where do I--
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.520]   Pizza's so cheap.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.360]   What do I have pizza for?
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.760]   I think I've got pizza for $12.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.360]   $20.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.160]   Oh, you've got to hold pizza for $20 or $12?
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.680]   Well, but--
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.520]   --pizza.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.040]   No.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.840]   Smell pizza.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.280]   Oh, from your refrigerator--
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   Pizza, we have pizza.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.480]   Not the fancy coal-fired Buffalo Montserrilla place.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   We do live in California.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.280]   Where it's like 18 bucks for a small one.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.920]   Well, I could get a big pie.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.360]   Well, but--
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.100]   I don't think you're getting a big pie here for $12,
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.160]   unless you're going to like little Caesars or Domino's
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   or something.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.200]   This is Jersey, where it's a crime for restaurants
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.920]   not to have pasta on the menu.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.560]   Do miss Jersey Italian food.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.040]   No, we have officially subsidized pizza in New Jersey,
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.400]   obviously.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.040]   All right.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.000]   Dang.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.040]   I need to move to Jersey.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.120]   I know.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   I have yet to find a cheap food item here
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.240]   in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.120]   I will tell you that.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   Whoo.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.760]   All right.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.400]   What is local?
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.360]   So I could eat it.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.960]   It's not the salmon, you guys.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.520]   OK.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.480]   What else is happening?
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.880]   I only ate half my sandwich.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.480]   We can't start.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.320]   We can't be talking about--
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:23.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.340]   Sorry.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:24.840]   --about food.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.080]   I'm going to get too hungry, and I'm going to get distracted.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.560]   Well, let's talk about the Pixel 4, because I kind of--
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   I was going to buy the 3A for Carsten.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.080]   OK.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.840]   And give my current phone, which is a 2, to my daughter.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.520]   But then Kevin was like, you're not
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.040]   going to take on Project Sully?
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.880]   And I was like, the Pixel 4.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.640]   That's what you got to wait for.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.520]   Yeah, if Sully excites you, then you're waiting for the Pixel 4.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.040]   I thought you said you had bought it.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.000]   You said done deal.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.760]   Well, yeah, but then I canceled it,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.440]   because my husband was like, we can't give her a cracked screen.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.600]   So then I was like, oh, no.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.840]   Oh.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.560]   My children proudly have cracked screens.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.800]   Well, that's what I was like.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.480]   And she wanted the case on mine, too.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.280]   Yeah, so it wasn't done deal, and then I canceled it,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:05.840]   because I sucked.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.720]   So your husband is basically the representative
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.800]   of OSHA and the family.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.360]   Actually, that's a really good point.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.560]   He's always the way--
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.520]   are those wires live?
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.080]   Did you double check?
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.080]   Yeah, you see.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   And you crazy mom--
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.680]   I'm just standing on a chair.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.360]   --is putting wires all over.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.720]   She's putting chips under her kids' skin.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.560]   She's putting things just all over the house.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.280]   She's putting wires under the bed and in the bathtub.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.000]   Yeah, I get the picture now.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.360]   Your husband's responsible one.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.480]   Well, no one would deny that in this house.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.560]   I know, Carson's like, Stacy, curse you.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.880]   I want the 3A.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.640]   Don't curse me.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.800]   Do you only have a 3A?
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.040]   I have a 3A.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.000]   I was just saying it's a good phone.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.480]   I like you.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   I love my 3A.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.240]   I want everyone to have one.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   I see.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.440]   I'm evangelizing headphone checks.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.160]   You know what, Carson?
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.920]   We'll see what the 4 has.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.000]   But presuming that the 4--
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.840]   Bet you doesn't have an iPhone jack.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.960]   I know, exactly.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.000]   Or a thumbprint thing, which may irritate me too.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.240]   4 and the Pixelbook, I hope, come out at the same time.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   My priority is clear.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.400]   I'm getting a Pixelbook.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.520]   And this phone can last me quite some time.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.840]   I'm trying to imagine what the feature is on the 4
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.080]   that would make me say, oh, I got to have it.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.400]   OK.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.240]   I do think-- yeah, exactly.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.680]   I want to be that guy.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.520]   OK, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.840]   I want to be that guy on the subway going, ooh, look at me.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.520]   I'm not even touching my phone.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.320]   Yeah, I did that.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.440]   Just magically.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.440]   I did that.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.880]   Wow.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.600]   This is what I want.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.520]   Yeah, we have to only do it one-handed.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.200]   Yes.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.800]   And I'm like, I think I want all of my windows to come open
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.200]   and show me what's on there.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.680]   But it's not like it's satisfying,
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   because it's a small screen.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.040]   So maybe I want something else.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.280]   Yeah, it just goes plink.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.600]   Like I--
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.200]   So here's the other problem I know I'm going to have.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.800]   OK, tell me.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   Oh, you had a move.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.240]   That plays over my problem.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.400]   Oh, you're who is a higher priority than my vetch.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.600]   Oh, well, I've already forgotten my-- it'll come back.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.720]   So I don't know if this is true of you.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.000]   Those damned faucets that you don't touch.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.720]   Yes.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.000]   It doesn't work for me.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.840]   Now, we know that there's a racial bias
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.640]   that doesn't work for people of color,
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.160]   but it doesn't also work with people with no color, like me.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.600]   And so I have to go through four or five faucets
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.560]   to get them up, or if my fear is the phone will be the same problem,
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.760]   it won't know that I'm there.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.640]   I'll be doing this all I want.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.160]   Right.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   And it won't let on there take the ten times off.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.760]   So we have some sort of undead detecting thing.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   No, hold on.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   It's not--
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   It's not--
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.360]   It's not only is ultrasonic, I believe.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.960]   Let me see what--
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.160]   I think it's 60 gigahertz wireless is what it uses,
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.960]   which means it's using wireless.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.160]   It's not a photon.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   It's not based on color.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   So as long as it's not infrared, you'll still--
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   It's radar gesture.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.160]   OK.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.160]   You're going to be fine.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   How does the faucet work?
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   Well, there's probably a multitude of different types of faucets,
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   but maybe it's IR.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.160]   How do you touch?
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   I didn't do my faucet homework for this show.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   I failed to look that up.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   I liked it, but you bothered to ask like I would know.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   You should know.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   I don't know.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   IR lights.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   So they are tiny IR lights, so it--
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   Carston was right.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   Yep, you're right.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   Tiny IR.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.160]   OK.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   If it's IR, then yeah, it won't work for you because you're a vampire.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   So are we saying the faucets need solely radar?
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.160]   Yes.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   Is this where we're headed right now?
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160]   Yes.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   This is the obvious like no brainer application for solely is to put it into a faucet.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   I think you might be onto something.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.680]   So I will say the same frequency and radar concept is actually being put on chips not
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:03.760]   just in solely, but in industrial automation for robots to quote unquote see people.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:09.400]   So it is a way to give computers an understanding of the world around them.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:14.040]   I would say it's kind of vision-y, but not actually vision.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.200]   So you're not far off actually.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.840]   And if we get it in more places, then yeah, it would be super cheap right now the radar.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   For a while the chips were way too big.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   Right.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   And now there's--
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.840]   Now what's the--
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.400]   It's a little bit of a new song.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.840]   What's the-- if it's constantly looking for-- if it's constantly getting--
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.360]   So it's doing-- what is doing?
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.880]   It's actually you can do it with Wi-Fi.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.840]   Anytime there's RF signals, so my hand-- it's imagine the signal going through the air whenever
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.840]   it--
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   It's your swimming--
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   Let me see.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   Let me guess.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.720]   Stacy's swimming to the shore message.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.720]   I don't know.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.760]   No, this is-- this is my frequency attenuation wave.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.760]   See, here is--
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.760]   Oh, it's your frequency.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   It's the frequency attenuation.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.760]   Okay.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   Well, mine's a--
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   Yes, shorter way to say.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.760]   Yes, shorter way to say.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.760]   Right.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   Anyway, well, nerd.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.800]   So when it hits something, it disrupts that wave.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.560]   And so it sends that information back and then the chip performs all this math and it
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.080]   says, "boop, there's a thing here."
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:20.640]   And this is-- it's exactly how time of flights-- time of flight sensors work using optics,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.040]   but it uses RF.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.400]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   No?
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   So--
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.800]   But there's another signal being constantly set out.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800]   Well--
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.640]   It sends it out.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   Yes.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.520]   Usually with the way these work, if it's not always on, which I don't know about the power
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:43.040]   constraints there, sometimes they do have something like IR or some sort of--
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.680]   Quick Vision Sensors.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.840]   So there's a couple of companies that make quick-- like, I recognize there's a person
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.600]   in front of me turn on.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.520]   So there are-- it works in conjunction sometimes with other sensors.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.240]   Which actually happens on your phone, believe it or not, with Facebook.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.480]   Could it be a power drain?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.120]   Or you think not?
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   Yes.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   It could be.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.120]   I mean, it all depends--
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.120]   I think there is a signal.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.120]   With power, it all depends.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   How do you implement it?
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.320]   How far do you want it to detect something?
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   You know.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.320]   I don't know.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.640]   All kinds of things.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:23.560]   Like, you know, is there some sort of like a lower energy chip inside the phone that talks
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:32.080]   to or that works in tandem with the project solely radar that can maybe lower the battery
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.080]   footprint on that?
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.080]   I don't know.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   I haven't heard anything--
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.520]   Well, I mean, again, something like this, think about-- it also depends on how far out
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.360]   you want it to measure, right?
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.160]   So like, if you're only going to measure something that's really close to you, you don't need
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.400]   your signal to travel as far and you don't have to care about it if it doesn't hit.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.160]   Like, say like, I'm going to send it out two feet and if it hits nothing, just don't send
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.160]   anything back, right?
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   So yeah.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.320]   But it probably does have like an ultrasonic, maybe a little vision sensor.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   There's a lot of things out.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.120]   I mean, it's kind of cool.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   How?
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:14.040]   Yeah, and I know that so obviously the solely radar coming on the Pixel 4, like there's
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:20.200]   some sort of integration where that will be used in combination with the facial recognition.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.600]   There's two different facial recognition cameras.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.760]   So that I think the solely tells the phone that you're pulling the phone up to your face.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.840]   And so at that point, it springs in action and fires off the facial recognition that
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.560]   that lets you in from what I understand about the technology that we've heard so far.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.560]   That's how it happens.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.520]   I don't know what the battery impact strangely.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   I've not even thought about what the battery impact would be.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.360]   So he says it uses very little energy on the Google homepage.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   Okay.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.360]   But what is that?
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.160]   I'm like, who the heck knows what that is.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   Let me hear.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.160]   I'll look at TI's radio specs.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.200]   That's something else.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.320]   So the solely, what were you geeking out searching up on last week?
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   I don't.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.120]   You were doing chip searches last week.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.320]   Yeah, you're doing it again.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   Well, you're asking me.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.080]   I mean, like, I don't keep specs for all of the chips in the universe in my brain.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.280]   I'm going to send your daughter a message and say, if you ever wanted to distract mommy,
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.600]   just to have her just ask some questions about a chip.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.400]   And she's going to go into the deep end looking things up.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   Frequency bands.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.440]   Ask her about frequency bands.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.440]   That'll distract her.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.280]   All right.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   All right, you guys.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   I absolutely love it.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   I absolutely love it.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   I love it.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.280]   I love it.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   I absolutely love it.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   I love it.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   I love it.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   I love it.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   I love it.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.280]   My battery, my power consumption.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   If I could you have ready access to that is also in and of itself.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.280]   Amazing.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.280]   It's just a Google search.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.280]   Oh, yeah, this doesn't give.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   I'm going to have to go deeper.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.880]   We have access to the world's information in our fingertips.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   We have access to the world's information.

[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   We don't actually want to see the whole three minutes.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   I think it shortened the abridged version from Jeff.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.880]   The abridged audio book was much better.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:34.880]   Absolutely preferred.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   I agreed.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:40.880]   Let's see here the final beta for Android Q released last week.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   Just some minor changes and stuff.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   Google had shared some information about gestures which gestures have become kind of the big
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:59.880]   to do around Android Q and whether people are going to actually enjoy their gestural navigation
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.880]   approach.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.880]   Google did, of course Google is a data driven company.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.880]   They've tested multiple scenarios just to be sure that they're going in the right
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   direction.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   They said that they found that their users actually prefer that -- go away Google.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   Oh wow it's been transcribing me for a while now.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:30.880]   Google said that users in the test actually prefer the three button method for ergonomics.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   However, Google also found that the gesture system works the fastest in terms of navigating
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   home and navigating back and people.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.880]   I am assuming that means wealth.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.880]   It's the fastest then it's the best even though people prefer the ergonomics.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.880]   The three button thing we're going to go gesture instead.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   I don't know if it's the right choice but it's the direction that they're going.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   People have a choice on which they can use.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:03.880]   Well, I know that it's going to ship with gestures out of the box.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:10.880]   However, they have to keep the three button navigation around for accessibility reasons
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.880]   because there are some people that would have a hard time with the movement.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.880]   And so having the three button approach.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:19.880]   Like me.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.880]   Yeah, I mean --
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.880]   But no, in all seriousness, that's important.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.880]   Yes.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:30.880]   I think it's good that they're not just getting rid of it entirely, right, and realizing that
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.880]   they can keep it around.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:37.880]   It kind of splinters their plan a little bit to keep multiple navigation methods.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   Personally, I don't feel like it hurts anything.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.880]   Maybe it hurts them longer term having to design.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.880]   What happens if you're an aspect to the OS for both?
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.880]   But no one's going to reread an app for gesture.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.880]   I think people are actually.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.880]   Really?
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:58.880]   I think they have to because one of the things about gestures on Android Q is --
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.880]   That's a good thing.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   I don't know if you have my overhead shot.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.880]   I didn't ask you to set it up.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   I can explain it.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   If I can act out a whole commercial, you can explain it.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   I can explain it.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.880]   Hold on.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.880]   So basically in Android Q, the navigation for back is swiping in.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.880]   Hold up your phone where you want it to be.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.880]   Where?
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.880]   There it is.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:19.880]   Okay.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.880]   Is that a one-one?
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.880]   This is comfortable.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.880]   Okay.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   No, sure.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.880]   Sure.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   Sure.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.880]   Sure.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:28.880]   Let's do the other one.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.880]   Yeah, okay.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.880]   Okay.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.880]   The other one I think is probably set up for last night.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.880]   It's all about Android, I imagine.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.880]   No, it's still not -- it's perfect.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.880]   Okay.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   This is perfect enough for me to show.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   So if I go into Chrome --
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.880]   [laughter]
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.880]   So for anyone listening --
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.880]   Yes, thank you.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:50.880]   [laughter]
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   For Jason and his arms stretched all the way out.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.880]   He's like leading --
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.880]   What I got to do --
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.880]   -- and really long arms.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.880]   It's what I got to do.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.880]   He's in my screen space.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.880]   My tripod arms.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.880]   We can make this work.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.880]   So in order to go back, you have to swipe in from the sides.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.880]   You have to swipe in from the sides like that.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.880]   You can do it on either side, but that is your back button
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.880]   essentially going forward.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.880]   There is no pill down at the bottom.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.880]   You don't see even a navigation pill when you're on the home screen
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.880]   right now.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:15.880]   There's nothing there.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   It appears when you're in apps.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.880]   So if I'm in Chrome, I get that little pill down at the bottom.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.880]   So that could be how I go to multitasking.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:24.880]   There's my multitasking.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.880]   It could be -- it's also how I go to --
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   Well, that's a problem actually for me.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.880]   So guys, do not laugh at me, but right now I have my phone.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.880]   Right now I have an RSI entry in my thumb.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.880]   Okay, it's because I've been reading a lot on my Kindle.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.880]   And so I have my -- I hold it like in one hand and then I
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.880]   mooch my thumb over to turn the page.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   So I've given myself an RSI entry.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.880]   So now I've got to be really conscious when I'm on my phone
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.880]   to hold it with one hand and then use the other finger to do everything.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.880]   So accessibility matters for you, yeah.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.880]   I mean, I can see like if you have arthritis or anything like --
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.880]   It's far easier to hold into swipe.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.880]   Especially --
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.880]   You know the other injury I get?
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.880]   I get little finger as prop for phone injury.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   That's because you get that --
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   Oh, you get that?
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   A little button.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.880]   It pops up.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   No, I'm just holding the phone.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   Oh, no, I don't want that.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.880]   I'm not going to put it on.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:27.880]   I'm stuck.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:28.880]   I'll talk it.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:29.880]   It'll change your life.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.880]   It will.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:32.880]   Although then you get the RSI because like I hold it with my two fingers.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:33.880]   Right, right.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.880]   And then I'm like -- and that is another --
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   Be careful, Stacey.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   I don't want you to injury your thumb again.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:38.880]   I know.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   I'm like, "I'm going to get first."
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   I totally do the little pinky end of the phone thing too.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   It's a habit of --
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.880]   And it hurts after a while.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:47.880]   I guess.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   It's a reflex.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   Yeah, it's a total reflex for me.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.880]   But to answer your question from earlier, yes, developers are going to
[00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:00.800]   have to develop around it because if there -- and there are Google apps that break this
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.520]   rule right now, there are Google apps that if you want to pull out the sidebar, you
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.880]   swipe in from the left side.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.880]   Well now in the new gesture paradigm, that is a back button.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.880]   So --
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880]   Wait.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.880]   Very important question.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.880]   What does this do to Tinder?
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.880]   Important to you, I guess.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.880]   No.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   Not at all.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.880]   Not at all.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.880]   Important to me.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   Kimmy doesn't watch this show anyways.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   Okay.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   I will say what most people say when they're on podcasts, I've never used Tinder.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:40.880]   But when -- Karsten, when you use Tinder, do you swipe in the middle of the image to the left
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880]   or right?
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.880]   Or do you go from the very edges?
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   Actually.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:51.880]   But this is -- no, this is -- in general, this is going to be a huge problem for a lot of
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.880]   apps.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.880]   Or who?
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:54.880]   Well, it is actually --
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.600]   It is where because if you're swiping right in your app to do something and then you move
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:08.400]   your finger ever so slightly to the edge of the screen, then you're out of the app.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.880]   You mean it's the back button?
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880]   Right.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.880]   The only way that the back button registers is if you're at the extreme edge of the screen
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.440]   when you swipe in, if that makes sense.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.120]   So certain UI paradigms like -- and I'm assuming Tinder is like this, when you've got an image
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.120]   and you're swiping it, you're not putting your finger at the very edge of the screen
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.440]   and swiping over.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   Maybe you are --
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   No.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   Well, I wouldn't know.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.440]   But --
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440]   Did a passion or something.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.440]   But, you know, because you're swiping fast or something like that, maybe it happens.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.320]   But I would imagine you're probably swiping from inside slightly.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.120]   And in that case, I think you're outside of the touch zones for back.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:51.000]   However, in this new version of Android Q, they do have a back button sensitivity option
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.440]   that's meant to allow for dialing in a better response on back versus like app intentions
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.720]   that -- where those swipes come in handy.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.560]   I haven't messed around with that.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.360]   I've heard that it only makes a marginal difference.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.840]   But no matter what, developers are going to have to work around it because it just interferes
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.880]   with the ways that a lot of apps actually operate.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.120]   And they've had time to do that.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.120]   But --
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:24.080]   This is going to be a UI nightmare because it's like how far from the edge is too far
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.400]   for the back button.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400]   And I mean --
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.320]   I'm smelling Newton jokes to come.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.560]   Newton jokes?
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.560]   Newton jokes.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.400]   Yeah, I meant to do this, but that happened.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.160]   Because I didn't do this quite right.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.160]   And I did that.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.560]   I'm not old enough to get this joke.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560]   A Newton joke?
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560]   Oh, that was cruel.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.560]   That was cruel.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.560]   Stay sneaky.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:51.400]   Is it the old apple Newton that you're talking about?
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   Yes.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.400]   I have one in my closet back there.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.120]   I don't know if that one's somewhere around here.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120]   You're like, we have something --
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120]   I told you.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.120]   I told you.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120]   Dunes -- wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.000]   Okay, let's -- so I was just writing about typewriters.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.120]   And I realized the things I had to explain to people, right?
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.960]   Wikipedia feels the need to explain white out.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.120]   Why would you ever want to eat a piece of paper?
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.200]   Well, for a certain age, they don't get that.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   I had to explain the monkeys when I was writing this, because why that was invented by --
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.240]   They did that song from Shrek.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.240]   That's how I know it's --
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   Michael, there's this.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   Right?
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:32.280]   So I want to look up Dunesbury and Newton.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.240]   Let's see.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.280]   Yes.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:43.080]   So look up Dunesbury and Newton, and it was the -- well, never mind.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.920]   It was a butt of jokes at the time.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.920]   Stacy.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   Okay.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.160]   I'm not -- I just -- I didn't know.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.160]   Here, I don't know.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]   Should I help it?
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.160]   I don't know if this is the right one.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160]   It wasn't paying attention then.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.160]   Is this the right one?
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.160]   Is this the right one?
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160]   Yes, that's it.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   Yes.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160]   Okay.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   I came up with two.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   All right.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160]   So.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.160]   I am writing a --
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.360]   He's scratching.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:14.760]   He's scratching on the stylists for our audio listeners.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.360]   His thought bubble is, I am writing a sentence.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.360]   The --
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360]   A test sentence.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.800]   -- says, I am fighting atomic century.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.440]   I am writing a test sentence.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.680]   Ian is writing a taste sensation.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.640]   I am writing a test sentence.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.680]   I am writing a test sentence.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.080]   Washing on egg freckles.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.080]   But --
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.640]   It was hilarious at the time.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.040]   Because so many shared the pain.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.760]   Maybe so many is overstating it.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.920]   How many people had the Newton?
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   The Newton of very --
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920]   It was?
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920]   -- very widespread.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   Not a --
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.840]   What was the other -- a special written language you had to have at the time for the other -- there
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840]   was another one.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840]   Oh, man.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.680]   What was that called?
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.680]   What was it called?
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.640]   It's a super obvious one.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   I feel like --
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.160]   Damn it.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.080]   Google helped me.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   Palm script.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   It's not scribble.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080]   Graffiti.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   There we go.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080]   Oh, there it is.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080]   Graffiti.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   So, Stacy, did you ever use a typewriter or manual typewriter?
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   Oh, Lord, no.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:22.080]   I -- we did have an -- my monitor thesis on an IBM Selectrix, I think.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080]   Selectrix?
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080]   No.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.320]   You know, Stacy, how you had to make an exclamation point on a typewriter?
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.960]   Oh.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.320]   You had to hit an apostrophe and then backspace in a period.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.800]   Oh, it's kind of like making an accent a goo and --
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800]   -- an arm of a dason.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800]   Did you know that?
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800]   No, I did not know that.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.000]   I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm Jeff today.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   So, apparently -- apparently we do.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   We have --
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   Yes, we have.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   We do have --
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   -- three newtons.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   Three generations here.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.400]   Here, let me hold them all out for the overhead camera.
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.440]   Oh, I overshot.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.880]   Too far.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   Their arms are long.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.880]   There we go.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.720]   A whole variety of newtons.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.280]   One for each of us.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:11.000]   And the idea, like, was it -- what timeframe are we talking about?
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.640]   Like, did they work in conjunction with computers or were they, like, the first tablets?
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.640]   I mean, what --
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.560]   They were -- they were -- they were palm competitors.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560]   Okay.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560]   They were -- wait, remind me where --
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.560]   I know.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.960]   -- they were -- I think -- Isaac Newton.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   They were before palms.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   One thing.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960]   They were way before palms.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   Because I -- I had a palm.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.160]   good. I'm thinking that I have
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:51.080]   that has a bell and if so why
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.220]   does ring?
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.660]   >> When you get to the end of
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.600]   the thing and you have to put
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.700]   the return carry to return back.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.700]   >> Good, good.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.700]   >> But that's only because when
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.700]   I was a little kid, you know,
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.700]   because I wanted to be a
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.700]   journalist at some point in
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.700]   time, you would have all these
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.700]   journalism movies and they'd be
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.700]   like, hey, boss, I got a story.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:12.700]   >> So then they never invented
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.700]   erasable ink for the typewriter
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.700]   ribbons. They did invent
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.700]   erasable paper. So today I
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.700]   have a lot of people who are
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.700]   interested in writing a book
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.700]   that's not just the
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:26.700]   writing, but the book is called
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.700]   The Simpsons. They did invent
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.700]   erasable paper. So today I
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   spent an hour trying to find out
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.700]   when it ceased manufacture.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.700]   It was eaten, carasable paper,
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.700]   only the oldest parts in the
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.700]   audience will understand this.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.700]   And it was this paper that had a
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.700]   coating on it so the ink wouldn't
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:46.700]   soak in so you could erase it.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.700]   But then everything you wrote
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.700]   kind of felt slimy.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.700]   >> It was a little bit too.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.700]   >> You know, it was a little
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   bit too. >> It was a little bit
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.700]   too. >> It was a little bit
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.700]   too. >> It was a little bit
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.700]   too. >> It was a little bit
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.700]   too. >> It was a little bit
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.700]   too.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.700]   >> Talk about an investment by a
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   bunch of those going to your
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.700]   time machine by a bunch of those.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.700]   Better than the stock market.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.700]   >> There is a erasable
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.700]   blonde, erasable typing paper.
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:34.700]   >> Interesting.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.700]   >> Did it smell like a
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.700]   mimeograph?
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.700]   >> No, that was a good
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.700]   smell.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.700]   The third grader has got high.
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   >> Yeah, that's a gooey paper.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:49.700]   >> I think that section probably
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.700]   appealed to a lot of people.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.700]   >> We need a new instrument for
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.700]   the old part section.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.700]   >> Yeah.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.700]   >> In fact,
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:03.700]   Carson, please go find that.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.700]   >> No.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.700]   >> When Leo starts talking about
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.700]   something old and I'll get him into
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700]   it.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.700]   I'll go to him into it.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.700]   You can play the old part theme.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.700]   >> I love it.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.700]   >> All right.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.700]   I have homework.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.700]   >> What is that song?
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.700]   >> I don't know.
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.700]   If you need me to, I'll sing it
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.700]   afterwards.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.700]   >> I'll sing it and my
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.700]   Pixel 3A will be able to tell
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.700]   what something is.
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.700]   >> Maybe it can.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.700]   >> My Pixel 2 does that.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.700]   >> I imagine the Pixel 4 will do it
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.700]   too.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.700]   >> The Benny Hill theme is an
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.700]   alternative.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.700]   >> That is Yackey Sax.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.700]   >> Is it?
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:49.700]   >> Yes.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.700]   >> Okay.
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.700]   >> Let's do it now.
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.700]   >> I was like moving a lot.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.700]   >> Leading up to the show, I was
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.700]   like, wow, there's a lot of
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.700]   really random news in here.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   I'm not sure what we're going to
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.700]   talk about.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.700]   Now I know.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.700]   Randomness.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.700]   >> This is what happens when
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.700]   you're not on the show.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.700]   >> You're usually very -- you
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.700]   keep us on track.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   >> We are the side-stelded
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.700]   podcast.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.700]   This is perfect for my mood
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.700]   today.
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.700]   I'm happy with it.
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.700]   Let's take a break.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:19.700]   Thank the sponsor.
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.700]   We'll get back into more of that.
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.700]   >> Trumpets.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.700]   >> This week in Google is
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.700]   brought to you by worldwide
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:28.700]   technology.
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.700]   WWT began building their
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.700]   advanced technology center ten
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:33.700]   years ago.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.700]   It's grown exponentially ever
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.700]   since.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.700]   It's like no other testing and
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.700]   research lab.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.700]   The lab contains more than a
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.700]   half billion dollars in
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.700]   equipment from hundreds of
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.700]   OEMs and key partners ranging
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.700]   from heavyweights like NetApp,
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.700]   Cisco, NVMWare to emerging
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.700]   disruptors like Tanium,
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.700]   Equinix, and Expanse.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   WWT is a trusted partner who
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.700]   stays with you over the years.
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.700]   Many of their customers have
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:59.700]   been with them for over a
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.700]   decade.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.700]   That's because they know that
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.700]   WWT is where they can go to
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:05.700]   get the answers they need to
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.700]   make sure their business runs
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.700]   right.
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.700]   Their ATC is an incubator for
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.700]   IT innovation and offers a
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:13.700]   number of things.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.700]   On-demand and schedulable labs
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.700]   like NetApp Cloud Volumes on
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:19.700]   Tap, on Tap, on Flash.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.700]   NetApp disaster recovery is a
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:23.700]   service along with hundreds of
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.700]   other labs representing newest
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.700]   advances in flash storage,
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.700]   multi-cloud, hyper-converged
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.700]   infrastructure, cloud data
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:32.700]   management, and more.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.700]   You learn about products
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.700]   before you launch.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.700]   WWT's engineers use these
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.700]   environments to quickly spin
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.700]   up proofs of concept and
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.700]   pilots using the sandbox so
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.700]   customers can confidently
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.700]   select the best solutions.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.700]   In many cases, this reduces
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.700]   concept time from months to
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.700]   weeks which increases speed to
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:53.700]   market.
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.700]   They offer lab as a service,
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:57.700]   which is a dedicated lab space
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.700]   within the ATC.
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.700]   This is where customers can
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.700]   perform programmatic testing
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.700]   using the vast technology
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.700]   ecosystem that WWT has
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.700]   already built.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.700]   It's virtual so you can take
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.700]   full advantage of ATC's unique
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.700]   benefits anywhere in the world,
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:14.700]   24/7.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.700]   WWT engineers work in these
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.700]   labs every day.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.700]   They're beta testing new
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.700]   equipment, they're building
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.700]   reference architectures, and
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.700]   custom integrations to help
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.700]   their customers make decisions
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.700]   and see results faster and
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.700]   with much less investment.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.700]   The time is finally here.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.700]   The way that WWT has launched
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.700]   their new digital platform
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.700]   encompassing the ATC ecosystem.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.700]   This ecosystem creates a
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.700]   multiplier effect of knowledge,
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.700]   speed, and agility.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.700]   Anytime anywhere around the
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.700]   world for their customers, so
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.700]   you can get access to articles,
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.700]   case studies, hands-on labs,
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.700]   and other tools that make the
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.700]   difference in today's fast-paced
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.700]   world.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.700]   You can learn more about
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.700]   WWT, the ATC, and sign up
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:00.700]   for free launch access to their
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.700]   new on-demand lab platform by
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.700]   going to www.com/twit.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:08.700]   www.tysimplifiesthecomplex.com
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.700]   that's www.t.com/twit.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.700]   www.tyisdeliveringbusiness
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.700]   and technology outcomes around
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.700]   the world, and we thank them
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.700]   for their support of this week
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:20.700]   in Google.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.700]   Let's see here.
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.700]   We actually have more
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.700]   googly things that we can talk
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.700]   about.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.700]   Actually, a number of
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.700]   a few things in here about
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:32.700]   YouTube.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.700]   Apparently, a YouTuber's
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.700]   Union, which formed two years ago,
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.700]   now has 21,000 members.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.700]   This is picking up steam.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:41.700]   Bloomberg says this could be a
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.700]   blueprint for labor organization
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:44.700]   of digital platforms.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.700]   Yeah, sure.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.700]   Organizer and YouTube
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.700]   George Sprave.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.700]   I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.700]   Teamed up with IG Metal,
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.700]   which is Europe's largest trade
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.700]   union to do this.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.700]   Basically, it's all in response
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.700]   to sudden demonetization of
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.700]   videos.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.700]   Specifically, the demonetization
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.700]   of videos with little to no
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.700]   explanation as to what led to
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.700]   it.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.700]   The union is requesting more
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.700]   transparency with the creator
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.700]   community.
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.700]   What does the strike look like
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:19.700]   if it relates to YouTube?
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.700]   Is it that creators stop
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:22.700]   producing content?
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.700]   They just make videos
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.700]   walking back and forth.
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.700]   Did we talk about this last
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.700]   week?
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:29.700]   We did.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:31.700]   I'm not trying to
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.700]   move on your story.
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.700]   Is there news that's related to
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:36.700]   this?
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.700]   This was something we talked about.
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.700]   I didn't see it in there.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.700]   You do not have to be sorry.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:43.700]   It's okay.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.700]   You didn't talk about it, but
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.700]   it's still a good topic.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.700]   I just know what to say.
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.700]   I just think it'll be videos
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.700]   of a big, inflatable rat.
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.700]   Do you guys know that reference
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:58.700]   or not?
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.700]   Yes, we do know that rat.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.700]   Rats are.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.700]   The union people stick it up.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.700]   When I lived in New York,
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.700]   though, I was like, that's the
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.700]   first time I'd ever seen it because
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.700]   I had grown up in Texas.
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.700]   So I was like, why is there a
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.700]   giant rat in front of the moma?
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.700]   We did the great thing for more
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.700]   out here, for some reason,
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.700]   but I don't know.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:22.700]   I don't know.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.700]   I'm not sure.
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:24.700]   I'm not sure.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.700]   I'm not sure.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:26.700]   All right.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:27.700]   Well, okay.
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.700]   So then we might see a union
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.700]   of some sort of response.
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:32.700]   We might not.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.700]   Oh, that's how we got the unboxing
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.700]   Jimmy Hoffa joke.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.700]   That was good.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.700]   Okay.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.700]   That was good.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.700]   Okay.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:43.700]   Thank you.
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:44.700]   Okay.
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.700]   Well, maybe this ties into it.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.700]   Meanwhile, some YouTube stars
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.700]   from the Washington Post spoke
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.700]   with 11 YouTube mods.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.700]   All those mods believe that popular
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.700]   creators, people like Logan Paul,
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.700]   are getting special treatment,
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.700]   looser restrictions.
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:00.700]   They can get away with things like
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.700]   demeaning speech, graphic content,
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.700]   bullying, et cetera, where others
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:09.700]   are being held responsible for that
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.700]   stuff.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.700]   Mods are saying they regularly
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.700]   recommended stripping ads from
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.700]   infringing videos, and we're often
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.700]   overruled by higher ups with the
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:22.700]   creators that had a higher profile.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.700]   YouTube mods said YouTube
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.700]   stances that nothing is really an
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:27.700]   issue until there is a headline
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.700]   about it, which is kind of
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.700]   troubling.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.700]   Kind of how the world works.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.700]   I mean, I'm going to say it should,
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:36.700]   and this is kind of a way that, like,
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.700]   online platforms give people the
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.700]   power to complain and be heard.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.700]   But, I mean, even in classrooms,
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.700]   you will have, you know, kids who
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.700]   are maybe more popular and well-liked
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:49.700]   can treat other kids like crap
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.700]   and get away with things not every
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.700]   kid gets away with.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.700]   So, I mean-
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.700]   Privilege has many flavors, yes.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.700]   Yeah, just life.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.700]   So, I'm now, I'm listening to
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.700]   Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow, Daniel
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.700]   Kahneman's book about how the brain
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.700]   operates in neuroscience, which I
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.700]   thought was going to be just one of
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.700]   those kind of, you know,
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.700]   ridiculous books, but it's
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.700]   scientific and it's interesting.
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.700]   So, one study that he mentions
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.700]   where judges in, I think it was
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.700]   Israel, can be wrong,
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.700]   they tracked on their
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.700]   decisions on parole.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.700]   They have, like, seven minutes to
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.700]   make parole decisions, right?
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.700]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.700]   And the closer you are on a lunch
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.700]   and they're hungry, it's like 90%
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:36.700]   don't get it.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.700]   As soon as they're back from lunch,
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.700]   like 90% get parole.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.700]   And so, there are odd things that
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.700]   are being privileged and making
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.700]   money, but all kinds of things.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.700]   So, you're right, Stacey.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.700]   Unfortunately, the way the world
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:50.700]   operates. Yeah, I had lunch.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.700]   Well, and so the solution would be
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.700]   to be more data driven, right?
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.700]   But then you're like, how do you,
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.700]   I mean, making the correlation
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.700]   and did they also do a good job
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.700]   of showing causation with that
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.700]   correlation or not?
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:04.700]   Because that's the other thing.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.700]   You have to then take all that
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.700]   data that you have, derive the,
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.700]   you know, the correlation there
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.700]   is to ensure that the method by
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.700]   which you're using to derive that
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.700]   correlation is actually as unbiased
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.700]   as possible, which is hard.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.700]   Right, which is hard.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.700]   Kahneman also talks about how he tried
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.700]   to unbiased his grading of two,
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.700]   test the questions.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.700]   And he was upset that he realized
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.700]   all the bias that he brought to it
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.700]   and didn't know what to do about it.
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.700]   We all have biased decisions.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.700]   Sure.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.700]   Not just to justify it.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.700]   Yeah, and that's why.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.700]   But you got to build systems that
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.700]   recognize that.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.700]   In thinking about how you can do it
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.700]   and what you're doing.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.700]   So like in this case,
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.700]   demonetizing YouTube creators.
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.700]   I mean, because like, think about
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.700]   when orchestras were like,
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.700]   oh, we don't have any women.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.700]   Why is that?
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.700]   And they started doing blind tryouts
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:55.700]   for orchestra.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.700]   You got more women.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:59.700]   And things like not putting a name
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.700]   on a resume is sometimes very
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:02.700]   helpful.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.700]   You know, we see people like
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.700]   women don't get jobs as often as men
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:07.700]   do.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:08.700]   We see people who don't get jobs
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.700]   as often as men do.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.700]   We see women or people with names
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.700]   that are perceived to be of color
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.700]   don't get jobs as often or job
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:15.700]   offers.
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:18.700]   So what is a method that might help
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.700]   moderate things more fairly?
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.700]   And would Google really want to do
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:23.700]   that?
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.700]   Probably not.
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.700]   Well, basically you got to
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:26.700]   recognize the unfairness and then
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.700]   you've got to build that in.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.700]   You got to build it in the
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.700]   compensation.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:31.700]   Yeah.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:37.700]   Should the YouTube mods be driven
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.700]   more towards kind of appealing to
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.700]   advertisers, which is one of the
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.700]   things that these mods kind of
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.700]   pointed out or to harm reduction
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.700]   because we're hearing a lot about
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.700]   that as well.
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.700]   Which is important, which is also
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.700]   an algorithmic issue.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.700]   So let me tie this if I may to
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.700]   Facebook.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.700]   Last week, when I was out there, I
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:00.700]   was at an oversight board meeting.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.700]   They brought in about 25 people who
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.700]   have written about the oversight
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.700]   board and took them through kind of
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.700]   the last round of their thinking
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.700]   about it and full disclosure, they
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.700]   paid for the hotel room and I have
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.700]   raised money from my school from
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:11.700]   Facebook by mid-event of the
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.700]   Facebook.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.700]   And so it goes just to what
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.700]   you're saying is what they try to
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:18.700]   do.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.700]   They try desperately to do is to
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.700]   say we have a set of rules and we
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.700]   are going to enforce those rules
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.700]   and that's what makes this fair.
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.700]   But it doesn't really work, right?
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.700]   And so now they recognize they
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.700]   need this kind of higher body to
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:32.700]   figure out whether the rules are
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.700]   fair and being enforced fairly.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.700]   And my argument about that was,
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.700]   well, okay, what's the higher
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.700]   bodies, North Star?
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.700]   Who are they responsible for?
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.700]   Are they responsible to the
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:45.700]   users, to the public, to
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.700]   government, to the company, to
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:48.700]   God and ethics?
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.700]   And they didn't really have that
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:51.700]   North Star built in.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:52.700]   So of course, I'm not sure
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:53.700]   they went and wrote one for them
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:54.700]   on Medium.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:56.700]   But none of this is as simple as
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.700]   saying there is a rule and an
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.700]   algorithm or a bunch of lowly
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.700]   paid people who are not going to
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:03.700]   enforce that.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:04.700]   At some level, you've got to make
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.700]   judgments and you've got to stand
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:08.700]   by those judgments and you've got
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.700]   to say why you made them.
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.700]   And transparency matters too.
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:13.700]   And that means humanity.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.700]   And these companies, I think YouTube
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.700]   now has, I forget the number, like
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.700]   9,000 people, 7,000 people they
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.700]   have hired to work on this stuff.
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:21.700]   Facebook has 30,000 people.
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:22.700]   They have hired to work on this
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:23.700]   stuff.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.700]   At that scale, it's really hard.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:26.700]   This is, they're not dealing with
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:27.700]   technology.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:28.700]   They're dealing with humanity.
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:29.700]   And humanity is difficult.
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:33.700]   We do.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.700]   We are working.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.700]   Which is especially at scale.
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:37.700]   That's scale.
[01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.700]   The more of us there are, the more
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.700]   difficult we become.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.700]   Yes, indeed.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:44.700]   And by the way, Jeff, I loved
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.700]   your piece last week.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.700]   I ran across your piece on the
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.700]   machine.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.700]   You can't say it out loud because
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.700]   you're getting from me.
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:54.700]   I was about to.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:55.700]   And I was like, maybe I
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:56.700]   shouldn't say that.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.700]   But yes, it was a great thing.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.700]   But yes, it was awesome.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:01.700]   It was responding to betos
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.700]   complained about journalism.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.700]   And it's fascinating that
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:08.700]   Beto O'Rourke and Ocasio-Cortez
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.700]   and Castro have all made, I think,
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.700]   very good criticisms of journalism,
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:14.700]   which we're hearing from them, not
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.700]   from journalists.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.700]   I'm happy your post got as much
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.700]   attention as it did.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:19.700]   Thank you.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.700]   It was really, really fascinating.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.700]   I was on MSNBC on Sunday about it.
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:25.700]   And they shocked me because they
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.700]   put, I just have a quick list.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.700]   And I turn around and there's my
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.700]   basically the 10 headlines by
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.700]   post on this huge wall screen.
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.700]   I wish I had said something
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700]   different there.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.700]   Okay.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.700]   What was the headline on the
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.700]   post?
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:41.700]   You got to help us.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:42.700]   Beto, the journalism, what the
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:43.700]   F.
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.700]   I spelled it out because my last
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:46.700]   rule was you're not our
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:47.700]   protector.
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:48.700]   Spare us your asterisks.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:50.700]   I just asterisked.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.700]   You're welcome, Lisa.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.700]   Isn't that what that's for
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.700]   iTunes?
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.700]   It's a censorship by the
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.700]   platform.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:22:59.700]   Ah.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:00.700]   Yes.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.700]   Did you hear that Facebook wants
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.700]   to get in on the news train again?
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.700]   Apparently Washington, the Wall
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.700]   Street Journal, sorry, reports of
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.700]   Facebook wants is approaching big
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   name news publications about a
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.700]   dedicated news section that is.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.700]   Stacy has an evil grin on her
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:18.700]   face.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.700]   She's a small story.
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.700]   She's totally into here, your
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:22.700]   opinion.
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:27.700]   You can go against it.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:28.700]   Publications are going to have
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.700]   control over how their articles
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.700]   appear on Facebook.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:33.700]   And Facebook has confirmed that
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.700]   this is a feature that is coming
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.700]   sometime in the fall.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.700]   They've talked about, I mentioned
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:40.700]   it briefly on the show after it
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.700]   was mentioned at Newsgeist
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.700]   Europe.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.700]   They're calling it a new news
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.700]   surface, which is a hard to say
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.700]   and very geeky because they talk
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:49.700]   about surfaces.
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.700]   It's a tab.
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.700]   And news will not leave the
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:55.700]   news feed.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:56.700]   It will still be there.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.700]   But one executive said to me at
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.700]   the company, "I can't control your
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:01.700]   uncle on news feed.
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:02.700]   I need a space where I can
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.700]   control the environment for news."
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.700]   And they recognize that not
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.700]   everybody's going to go there,
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.700]   that it's for us freaky people
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.700]   who actually read the news.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:13.700]   And they're going to pay
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.700]   publishers.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.700]   It looks like, according to the
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:17.700]   Journal, and what I've heard
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.700]   they're going to make a multi-year
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:20.700]   commitment to do that.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.700]   It's going to be a limited
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.700]   small number of publishers.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.700]   It's going to be, I think,
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.700]   somewhat curated and
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.700]   somewhat algorithmic.
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:30.700]   And they're going to try
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:31.700]   for personalization.
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:32.700]   That's pretty much what I know
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:33.700]   about it.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.700]   And it's going to launch as soon
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:36.700]   as this falls so kind of
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.700]   imminently.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:38.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:39.700]   Yeah, right around the corner.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.700]   Should publishers be
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.700]   rushing to get involved this time
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:44.700]   around?
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.700]   Do they learn?
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.700]   I always follow the example of
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.700]   the Washington Post and
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:50.700]   Marty Barron.
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.700]   I don't know whether they've
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:52.700]   signed up or not.
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:53.700]   But generally, the Post has said,
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.700]   "We'll try anything."
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.700]   And if it's awful, then we'll
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:57.700]   leave it.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.700]   And I think that my view here is
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.700]   that no matter what you think of
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.700]   Facebook, the public we serve is
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:05.700]   there.
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:06.700]   And on the one hand,
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.700]   journalists have been screaming
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:08.700]   and yelling, "These platforms
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.700]   stole our money as if God gave
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:11.700]   it to them and God didn't, but
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:12.700]   fine."
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:13.700]   They stole our money and they
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.700]   should do us some money.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:15.700]   And so then Facebook comes along
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.700]   and says, "Okay, we're going to
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.700]   use some money."
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:18.700]   Then you're going to corrupt
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.700]   us with your money.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.700]   You don't do that.
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:21.700]   You can't win.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.700]   I think it's worthy.
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.700]   I was a little dubious at first,
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:25.700]   but I think that the way they're
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:26.700]   talking about it is just to have
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.700]   a space on Facebook for news.
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.700]   I think makes sense.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.700]   I think it's worth trying to do.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.700]   But let's be clear here,
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:35.700]   New Zealand's.
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.700]   There is no messiah.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.700]   Nothing's going to save us,
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:42.700]   except our own innovation and
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.700]   our own changing our own business.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.700]   So if anybody thinks this is going
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.700]   to be a huge bucket of money and
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.700]   it's going to solve all your
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.700]   money problems, it's not.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.700]   But what the heck?
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.700]   More money?
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:54.700]   Somebody from Facebook?
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.700]   Sure.
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:57.700]   And I have been waiting for my
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:58.700]   bucket of money and it still has
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:25:59.700]   a show up.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:00.700]   I'm very upset.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:01.700]   To the end of the rain
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.700]   boat, Stacey.
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.700]   Just kind of find the rain.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.700]   Just keep waiting.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.700]   I've just got to keep going.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:06.700]   Just keep waiting.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.700]   There with my lucky charms.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:09.700]   All right.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:16.700]   So what should a publisher ask
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:17.700]   themselves?
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:18.700]   So I was looking at that and I'm
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.700]   like, you know, like the drawbacks
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.700]   to AMP if you amplify your
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.700]   website.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.700]   Then you've got all these links
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:27.700]   that you know you can't unamp.
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.700]   They kind of don't belong to
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:31.700]   anymore.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.700]   Is there any sort of concern about
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:34.700]   that here?
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:35.700]   I don't know how they're going to
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:36.700]   format it.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:37.700]   I don't know whether there was one
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.700]   report that I don't believe that
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.700]   said it wasn't going to be content.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.700]   It was just going to be links and
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.700]   they were paying for links.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.700]   I don't think that's true.
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:46.700]   I think it's European wishful
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:47.700]   thinking.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.700]   I could be wrong.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.700]   I would imagine this is
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:55.700]   duplicative of your own website.
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:56.700]   Okay.
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:57.700]   So then it's not.
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:58.700]   I don't know.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:26:59.700]   I would just bet that because
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.700]   they already have its narrative.
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:02.700]   So I would imagine it just uses
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:03.700]   that and says you have to meet a
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.700]   street limit about how fast this
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.700]   is.
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:09.700]   You know the other thing they're
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.700]   working on.
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.700]   You know they like Google have
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:14.700]   been working on trying to own
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:15.700]   subscriptions.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:16.700]   They're trying to own
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:17.700]   membership.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.700]   They're trying.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:19.700]   I've had people call me and try
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:20.700]   to get how else can we try to get
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:21.700]   revenue for publishers.
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.700]   The companies really do want to
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:24.700]   do that.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:25.700]   The problem is the basic model of
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:27.700]   the publisher is still worked.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.700]   It really is.
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:30.700]   And it's tough and it's
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.700]   frustrating because like I want
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:35.700]   to support publications given my
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:36.700]   career.
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:38.700]   But by God I can't afford
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:39.700]   everything.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.700]   And you know the
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.700]   advertiser model was awesome.
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.700]   So how do we bring something?
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.700]   What else subsidizes good
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:49.700]   journalism and the answer is.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.700]   I saw him Williams.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.700]   I saw him Williams last week.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:54.700]   You know when he's changed his mind
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:56.700]   a couple times as we know.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.700]   But he believes that he can make
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:00.700]   something work with consumer
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.700]   payments and splitting it up.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.700]   So I think that's a very good
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:05.700]   question.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.700]   On medium.
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:08.700]   The weird thing for me is that
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.700]   they try to put my stuff on the
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.700]   paywall medium and I say I don't
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:12.700]   want that.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:13.700]   I want to brainwash people.
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:14.700]   That's why I'm there.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:15.700]   I want more.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:16.700]   My propaganda platform.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.700]   Exactly.
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.700]   Hypnotize the public.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.700]   But.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.700]   Everything he started making go and
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.700]   started to hire some journalists
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:24.700]   again.
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:25.700]   Full disclosure is he's laid them
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.700]   off in the past but I think that
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.700]   he's trying.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.700]   Again there's just no messiah.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.700]   That's all.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:33.700]   Hmm.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.700]   What else we got?
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:36.700]   Have we done?
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.700]   Have we had any trumpets playing?
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:39.700]   No we haven't.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.700]   Well you know I was about to ask
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.700]   are there any stories that you
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:44.700]   want to get in before the
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.700]   trumpet play before they sound?
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:48.700]   Well it's like the way you go.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.700]   My piece.
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.700]   Oh I think we should mention
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:51.700]   briefly if I may.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:52.700]   Yes.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:54.700]   There's been some horrendous
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:55.700]   coverage in the last week or so
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:56.700]   of section 230.
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:58.700]   The New York Times did a big
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.700]   package with three stories and
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.700]   they had to put out a correction
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.700]   that basically pulled the rug out
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:06.700]   from the entire story.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:07.700]   They thought the section two that
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:08.700]   was the protection of free speech
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:09.700]   online it's not in the United
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.700]   States it's the first amendment.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.700]   The coverage of then somebody else
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.700]   complained about business week's
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:17.700]   coverage.
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.700]   The coverage of tech policy is
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:20.700]   getting worse and worse and worse
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.700]   and I really see a danger to 230
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.700]   here that could be done out of just
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.700]   playing ignorance.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:28.700]   And there's some better coverage
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:29.700]   coming out now I think this one
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:31.700]   got better reviews you just showed
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:32.700]   from Wired.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.700]   But I just want to mention that
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.700]   you have pros like Stacey who
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.700]   really understand the beat and
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:40.700]   really understand the implications
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:42.700]   and really know their stuff.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.700]   And then you have tech coverage
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.700]   now which has gone from ignorant
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:50.700]   and trying to look for some
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.700]   wonderful rainbow end of the
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:55.700]   rainbow with a pot of gold and
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.700]   then now is turned to ignorant
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:58.700]   and dystopian.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.700]   And the truth is somewhere
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.700]   between and it's too
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:03.700]   uninformed and it's really the
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.700]   quality of tech coverage is
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:06.700]   bothering me a lot.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.700]   >> Well, that's the function of
[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.700]   a lack of experience that I will
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.700]   say I don't I'm not covering
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.700]   this but I will say tech policy
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.700]   is hard.
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.700]   Because it incorporates tech
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:21.700]   which is always hard and there
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.700]   are things you have to understand
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.700]   like when I cover the FCC it's
[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:25.700]   really important for me to
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.700]   understand like spectral
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.700]   efficiency even though it doesn't
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:29.700]   feel like you should have to
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.700]   understand that.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.700]   And then you have to understand
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:34.700]   the laws and what words are
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.700]   going to matter inside the laws
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:38.700]   that people propose and where
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.700]   the ambiguities are.
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.700]   And that requires a journalist
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.700]   who's been on the beat for a
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:43.700]   really long time.
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:47.700]   And I don't know how many like
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.700]   30 or 40 or 50 and above your
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.700]   old journalist there are still
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.700]   especially at a tech
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.700]   publication which usually get
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.700]   because the model is so
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:30:59.700]   turn turn turn turn.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.700]   >> Yes, I think there's very
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.700]   few Cecilia Kang's in the world
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:06.700]   and there's a lot more.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.700]   Oh, he also works the two times.
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.700]   I was going to say Brian Chen.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.700]   Man, he does not always know
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.700]   what he's talking about.
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.700]   But that's I mean that's why
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.700]   there's not a lot of informed
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:19.700]   tech policy.
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.700]   And so then you the publications
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.700]   turn to people with an agenda
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.700]   to write about it.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.700]   >> Yes.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.700]   >> And they do that because they
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.700]   need someone who has the policy
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.700]   experience if they're a tech
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:33.700]   firm or if they're a policy
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.700]   firm then they just usually
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.700]   turn to lobbyists or lawyers.
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.700]   So that's not helpful.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:39.700]   >> Yep, it's all true.
[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:40.700]   So thank you.
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:41.700]   I just wanted to get that little
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:43.700]   mini-screen and absolutely.
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.700]   >> All right.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.700]   Well, without further ado then,
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.700]   I think it's time to sound the
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:50.700]   horns.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:55.700]   >> The Google change log.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.700]   >> Holy cow, a lot has changed
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.700]   this week.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.700]   There are many changes starting
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.700]   with Google Maps, bringing its
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.700]   AR navigation to, I think, all
[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:05.700]   Android phones and iPhone
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:06.700]   devices.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.700]   >> You guys used this in the
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:09.700]   wild?
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.700]   >> That was going to be my
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   question for you.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.700]   I have used it.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.700]   I used it once, once while I was
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:14.700]   out and about and I wasn't
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.700]   quite sure which direction I
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.700]   needed to be facing.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.700]   Yeah, it was neat.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:20.700]   It was neat and it was actually
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:21.700]   useful in that moment.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:22.700]   It's not something I use every
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:23.700]   day.
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:24.700]   >> Stacey?
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:25.700]   >> Definitely.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:26.700]   >> Me too, although I will say my
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:28.700]   GPS and compass on my phone are
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.700]   just freaking terrible, which
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.700]   really impacts the quality of
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.700]   this.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:34.700]   This is always my issue.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:35.700]   It's like you're going the
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.700]   right, oh no, you were really
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.700]   going the wrong way.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:39.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   And it's like do the figure eight
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.700]   to make your compass better.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   And I'm like, I've done the
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700]   figure eight.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:45.700]   >> I've seen it and it sent me
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:46.700]   off in the purported right
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.700]   direction only to change its
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:48.700]   mind later.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:49.700]   >> My complaint with it, because
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.700]   I want to have a complaint, I've
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.700]   been dying for this and I used
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:54.700]   it.
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:55.700]   I think it was in Paris last.
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.700]   I was at for humble break.
[01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:59.700]   And I haven't tried the latest
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.700]   latest release, so maybe it's
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.700]   better.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:04.700]   But this was about six weeks ago.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:06.700]   And to try to keep you from
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.700]   getting killed, you're holding
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.700]   it like this, looking where
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:11.700]   you're going literally because
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:12.700]   it's telling you, follow the
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:13.700]   arrow, right?
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:15.700]   And then it'll say, don't do
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:16.700]   that because that's going to get
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:17.700]   killed, you idiot.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.700]   I'll put the phone down.
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.700]   So then you put the phone down
[01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:22.700]   and you walk five steps and you
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:23.700]   still say, I don't know where I'm
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:24.700]   going now.
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.700]   So you get the thing back up
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.700]   again.
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.700]   Now it makes you take pictures
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:28.700]   all around you looking like an
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.700]   absolute idiot as you turn around
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:30.700]   taking pictures all around.
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.700]   Then you find it again.
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.700]   Then you repeat rinse and repeat.
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:37.700]   And so I've been dying to have
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.700]   this.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:40.700]   The walking in the bathroom has
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.700]   always been bad.
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.700]   I'll try the new version.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.700]   But this is the case where
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.700]   probably the old watch motif
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.700]   where it buzzes at you and knows
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:50.700]   where you are and tells you to
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:52.700]   turn or tells you to put the
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.700]   watch up.
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.700]   The weird thing to me is the
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:55.700]   phone never has a compass that
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:57.700]   if you say in the car, if I hold
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:58.700]   it this way, can't that know which
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.700]   way I'm pointing it?
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.700]   But it doesn't.
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:04.700]   I think that, well, yeah,
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:05.700]   that's a, I guess that's a
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:06.700]   good question.
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:07.700]   I would never have the arrows
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:08.700]   never quite right.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:09.700]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:11.700]   That's correct.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:12.700]   I would fully agree with that.
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:13.700]   My experience with this was
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:14.700]   actually, actually pretty
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:15.700]   effective.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.700]   It, for the most part, kept
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:18.700]   it locked in.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.700]   I did get the, you know, the
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.700]   message that you're talking about
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:23.700]   where you're holding it up to
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:24.700]   too long.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.700]   And it's like, nope, you've
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:26.700]   got to put your hand down,
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:27.700]   like, focus on the road while
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.700]   you're walking and look at this,
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:30.700]   you know, every once in a while
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:31.700]   instead of like just walking
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:32.700]   like this.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.700]   And when I pulled it back up,
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.700]   I didn't have to rescan.
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:36.700]   It just kind of like picked up
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:37.700]   from where I was.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.700]   I left off.
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:39.700]   Let's go see it.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.700]   I don't know.
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:41.700]   That's probably how it's
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.700]   supposed to work.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:43.700]   And for whatever reason, you
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:45.700]   know, is requiring you to rescan.
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:46.700]   That would be really annoying.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:47.700]   It worked pretty well for me,
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:48.700]   though.
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.700]   So I'm positive on that.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:52.700]   See, and I try to, once I start
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:54.700]   my directions, I actually don't
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.700]   want to pull out my phone because
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.700]   it makes me feel like one of the
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.700]   first things I, you know, taught
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:01.700]   my daughter and I learned.
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:02.700]   I don't know if guys learn this
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.700]   too, but don't look at your phone.
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:06.700]   It makes you a possible victim,
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:07.700]   right?
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:08.700]   You look distracted and people
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:11.700]   might like muggy or something.
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:13.700]   So I always keep my, like, I set
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.700]   it up and I go and I put my phone
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.700]   in my pocket and I wait for it to
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.700]   like vibrate to tell me or tell
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:19.700]   me to turn.
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:20.700]   Right.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:21.700]   So.
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:23.700]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:24.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.700]   New security feature for Android
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.700]   phones, which basically allows you
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.700]   to use your fingerprint that you
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:32.700]   used to authenticate on your phone
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.700]   to get into some of Google
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   services.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   So this is first appearing in
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.700]   Chrome for Android.
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.700]   If you visit passwords.google.com
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:43.700]   on the phone, you may be prompted
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:44.700]   to authenticate using your
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:46.700]   fingerprint sensor.
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:47.700]   And this is all based on the
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.700]   FIDO2 framework that was
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:52.700]   introduced at Android 7.0.
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:54.700]   And it's just, you know, kind of
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.700]   part of Google's ultimate effort
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:58.700]   to peel away from password,
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.700]   from a requiring passwords,
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.700]   which can be faulty in and of
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:02.700]   themselves.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:04.700]   And instead, you know, opt for
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:06.700]   something on the device.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.700]   That they don't have access to
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:10.700]   that can still authenticate you
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:11.700]   effectively.
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:12.700]   First, no, no, you got it.
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.700]   I just sent you a photo
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:14.700]   regarding the last story.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:15.700]   Did you get a picture?
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:16.700]   Let me see.
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.700]   Did you email it?
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:18.700]   Email.
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:19.700]   Email.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:21.700]   Let me check.
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:22.700]   I'm sure I got it.
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.700]   No, I didn't actually.
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:25.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:26.700]   Okay.
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:27.700]   So this relevant to the last
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.700]   story, sorry, took a minute, is
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.700]   on the floor in a hallway at
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:32.700]   Twitter.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.700]   Eyes up.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:36.700]   Nice.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:37.700]   Nice.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:38.700]   Nice.
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:39.700]   Nice.
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:40.700]   That's cool.
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:41.700]   No.
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:42.700]   And that's in the, and that's
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.700]   the maps app, right?
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:45.700]   No.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:46.700]   Oh, no.
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:47.700]   This is, this is based on the
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.700]   website.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.700]   My brain was still locked into
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:51.700]   and I was like, wait a minute.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:52.700]   Why were you navigating through
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:54.700]   the Twitter HQ with, with the
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:55.700]   Google Maps?
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.700]   I was a little slow.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:58.700]   I only ate half a sandwich
[01:36:58.700 --> 01:36:59.700]   today.
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:00.700]   Okay.
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:01.700]   Give me a break.
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:02.700]   That is great.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:03.700]   I love it.
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:04.700]   I love that.
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:05.700]   What kind of sandwich was it,
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:06.700]   Jason?
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:07.700]   What kind of sandwich?
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:08.700]   I think it's just like a, no,
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:09.700]   it was a tuna sandwich.
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:10.700]   It was a tuna salad sandwich.
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:11.700]   It was just free food.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:12.700]   Oh, God.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:13.700]   You've got a, yeah.
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.700]   You've got a tuna salad sandwich
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:16.700]   just sitting out somewhere.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.700]   That's cruel to your colleagues.
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:20.700]   I guess so.
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:22.700]   Well, I sit next to Carston.
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.700]   So we'll, we'll both enjoy the
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:26.700]   smell of that, that room when we
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:27.700]   get back there.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:28.700]   You're welcome, Carston.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:31.700]   A browser tabaholics rejoice.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.700]   Chrome is testing a new tab
[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.700]   grouping feature apparently.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.700]   If you download the latest Chrome
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.700]   Canary build, it's still
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:40.700]   experimental.
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.700]   Google says you do risk losing
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:43.700]   browser data or compromising your
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:44.700]   security or privacy.
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.700]   But if you want to try it, you
[01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:47.700]   can.
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:49.700]   It's basically a way to group Chrome
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:50.700]   tabs into a single tab.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.700]   Pretty much what it sounds like.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:56.700]   It can be enabled in the flags part,
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.700]   you know, area of Chrome to search
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:00.700]   for groups while you're there and
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.700]   you can activate it.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.700]   Chrome OS 76.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.700]   What if I had the update on this?
[01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:07.700]   Is rolling out some pretty cool
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.700]   new features, Android style
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:11.700]   notification media controls, also
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.700]   GPU acceleration for
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.700]   Kristini and Linux containers.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.700]   But I think the feature that
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.700]   people are going to notice
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:20.700]   probably is the support for
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.700]   virtual desks.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:23.700]   And I think we, we talked about
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.700]   this the last time I was on with
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.700]   Kevin Tofel who talked about
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.700]   these virtual desktops so you
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.700]   can have different desktops
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.700]   that you can switch in between
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:34.700]   for different tasks and everything.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:35.700]   And something that you might,
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.700]   you're probably seen before on
[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:39.700]   Mac OS and Windows.
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:41.700]   I've been trying to get to it,
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.700]   but I'm on 75 and I can't,
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.700]   well, I can't force it to upload
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:45.700]   to 76.
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.700]   And I'm not seeing, yeah,
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.700]   I'm not seeing an update on mine
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.700]   to go there yet.
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.700]   But I'll be looking for it.
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.700]   This is a pretty, pretty minor
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.700]   Google Docs apparently added a
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.700]   new Lexined font family that's
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.700]   designed to be easier and faster
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:03.700]   to read eight different widths.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.700]   So when you want the dock that
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.700]   you're sending to be easy to read
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.700]   and fast apparently use this font.
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.700]   Well, it looks horrible.
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:12.700]   Yeah, I don't like it at all.
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.700]   And unreadable.
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:14.700]   Yeah.
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:17.700]   But hey, is it, is it even easy
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:19.700]   to read like that top thing?
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.700]   I feel like all the spacing makes
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.700]   it difficult for me to like a night
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.700]   test.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.700]   This is actually very useful for
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.700]   teachers though because surprisingly
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:33.700]   few fonts use the right A.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:34.700]   Oh, okay.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:36.700]   And so now, now you don't have to
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:38.700]   use comic sans all the time if
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:39.700]   you're a teacher.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:40.700]   Oh, that's good.
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.700]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, why do you
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.700]   use comic sans because you want
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.700]   the kitty A.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.700]   The lower case A.
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.700]   It doesn't have the most fonts is
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.700]   the fancy one.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.700]   And don't you just teach them that
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:57.700]   today?
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.700]   Well, for young children like who
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:02.700]   are learning to read it to be
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:03.700]   confusing.
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:05.700]   When they're handwriting, no one
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.700]   makes the fancy A.
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:07.700]   Everyone makes the unmaking.
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.700]   Nobody teaches handwriting anymore.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:10.700]   That's not true.
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:11.700]   My daughter actually learned
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.700]   cursive before she learned to
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.700]   write in print, which is really
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:16.700]   strange.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.700]   Yeah, my kids just in print.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:19.700]   But in great sense,
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:20.700]   and fancy A.
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:23.700]   Yeah, definitely working on
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.700]   cursive at our kids school.
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:27.700]   Jeff, you're getting this old
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:28.700]   man get off my lawn kind of
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:29.700]   look.
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:30.700]   Don't do it.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.700]   It makes sense.
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:32.700]   All right.
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:33.700]   All right.
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:34.700]   All right.
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:35.700]   It's like moving on.
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.700]   Speaking of education though, new
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.700]   updates to Google for
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.700]   education course kit.
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.700]   Something that was first launched
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.700]   last year for teachers to
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:44.700]   integrate docs and drive into
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:45.700]   course assignment work.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.700]   It's now going to be called
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:48.700]   assignments and run as a
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:49.700]   standalone tool.
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.700]   But it includes a new feature.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:52.700]   It's interesting called
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.700]   originality reports.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.700]   This checks for similar works
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:57.700]   in the database and on the
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.700]   internet.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:40:59.700]   Yes, it can detect.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.700]   It can be used to detect
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.700]   plagiarism, but also missing
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:03.700]   citations.
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.700]   So, you know, I mean, it's a
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.700]   nice way of saying plagiarism.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:08.700]   Yes.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.700]   I believe you may be missing a
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:12.700]   citation.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.700]   Would you like to add it?
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:15.700]   Okay.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:16.700]   Good.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:17.700]   Good.
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:18.700]   Could have been awkward.
[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:20.700]   Anyways, I think that's an
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:21.700]   interesting tool.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:23.700]   And Google search is going to
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:25.700]   now include individual podcast
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.700]   episodes that feature the
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.700]   topic of your search term.
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.700]   For now, if you include the
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:32.700]   word podcast into your search
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.700]   query, you will see these up at
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.700]   the top of your search results.
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.700]   Clicking a podcast result that
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.700]   comes up opens it inside of
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.700]   Google podcasts.
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.700]   Eventually, I don't know if it
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.700]   does yet, but eventually it will
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:45.700]   work with assistant commands to
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.700]   something like HAG, play
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.700]   podcast about golden
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.700]   retrievers, and then it would,
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.700]   you know, come back with one and
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.700]   play it.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:53.700]   And of course, Google is
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.700]   indexing a podcast audio
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:57.700]   content in order to do this.
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.700]   And I think we're going to see
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:02.700]   more and more down this road as
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.700]   far as podcasts are concerned
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:05.700]   with all that indexing.
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:06.700]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.700]   Kind of exciting stuff to make
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:09.700]   it all searchable.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:11.700]   And then finally, Visa announced
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:12.700]   that it's shutting down its
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:14.700]   Visa Checkout service in 2020.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.700]   As such, Google is removing it
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.700]   from Google Pay.
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:20.700]   Something I never use.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:22.700]   I need to use Google Pay more.
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:23.700]   I think I say that.
[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.700]   My credit card doesn't work on
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:25.700]   it.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.700]   I mean, I want to use it, but
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:27.700]   mine doesn't go.
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.700]   I put it on.
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:30.700]   I think I've used it twice.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.700]   I think I had to use it because
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:33.700]   I downloaded somebody's
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.700]   transportation app that
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:35.700]   required me to use it.
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:36.700]   Okay.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.700]   I think it was Stockholm's
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:40.700]   Transportation Act.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:42.700]   I think I've used it a handful
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:43.700]   of times on my phone when I
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.700]   forget my wallet and I'm
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:45.700]   somewhere.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.700]   I'm just I'm sewing.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:48.700]   The wallet is so ingrained in
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:49.700]   me.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:50.700]   It's an awesome.
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:51.700]   I just when I forget my
[01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:52.700]   wallet, I just go to Starbucks.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:54.700]   Have I shown you my wallet?
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.700]   Have I shown you my beloved
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.700]   wallet?
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.700]   No.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:58.700]   Okay.
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:42:59.700]   This like you ready?
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.700]   Are you ready for this?
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.700]   You're ready for this.
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:02.700]   You're a raceable print paper.
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:04.700]   Oh.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:05.700]   Oh.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.700]   How about showing you my wallet,
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:08.700]   Jeff?
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.700]   Go ahead.
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:11.700]   Go ahead.
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:12.700]   Single.
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:13.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:14.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:15.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.700]   Wait.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:17.700]   I want one of those.
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:18.700]   How does that work?
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:19.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:21.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:22.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:23.700]   I think Jeff wins.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:25.700]   Jeff wins because his all pop
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:26.700]   up at different.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.700]   His go.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.700]   His is are a little bit more
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:30.700]   majestic than mine.
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:31.700]   I'm just like, oh.
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.700]   What kind of wall are these or
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.700]   is this like a trick?
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.700]   No, this is this mine is called
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.700]   a secret S E C R E D.
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.700]   And this is going to be an old
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:41.700]   fart moment.
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.700]   Get the get the bazookas ready
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:44.700]   here.
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:45.700]   And one of the instrument is so
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:46.700]   I used to have my wallet in my
[01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.700]   rear pocket and then I was
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.700]   getting bursitis and my rear end
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:51.700]   and my hip and it was causing
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.700]   pain and I just could.
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:55.700]   So I finally I could got
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:56.700]   to sell it.
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.700]   This takes six cards plus my
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:00.700]   employee card plus my health
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.700]   card plus the subway card.
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:05.700]   And it amazes guess as
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.700]   wonderful.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:07.700]   If it's my front pocket, it's
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.700]   tiny.
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.700]   And I love it.
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:10.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:11.700]   I love it.
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:12.700]   I completely.
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:13.700]   I'm totally buying one of these
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:14.700]   for my husband.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.700]   This is the greatest thing S E C R
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:17.700]   there you go.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.700]   I found it.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:20.700]   Love it.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:21.700]   S E C.
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.700]   I don't want one of for me.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:24.700]   I D.
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:25.700]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.700]   They're very pretty.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:27.700]   Yeah, they're nice.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:28.700]   They're nice.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:29.700]   So do they require battery?
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.700]   What's the best way to get
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.700]   the best?
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.700]   So do they require battery?
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:34.700]   What's the deal?
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:35.700]   So I don't know yours is you
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:36.700]   actually move the button.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.700]   It's just a switch blade.
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.700]   It's like a switch blade.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:42.700]   It's like a mechanical button.
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.700]   This is an extra.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:46.700]   This is an extra brand.
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.700]   And it actually has so in the
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:50.700]   back here I actually did a
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:51.700]   review of this not too long ago
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.700]   for hands on tech.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.700]   It has this little tracker in it
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:56.700]   that's that charges through
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:57.700]   solar power.
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:59.700]   So you just slide it in there
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:00.700]   and then I know where my wallet
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:01.700]   is if I've left it behind or
[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:04.700]   wait so years when do you take
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:06.700]   it out of your wallet which is
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.700]   in your dark pocket when do you
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:09.700]   say when when is that
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.700]   possibly exposed to the sun?
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:12.700]   You have to set it out.
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:13.700]   But I mean the battery charge
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:15.700]   yeah I mean you don't have to
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:16.700]   do it very often but the
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:17.700]   battery lasts for like four
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:18.700]   months.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:20.700]   So what's your wallet?
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:22.700]   What's that the extra I think
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:24.700]   it's called the extra parliament?
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:28.700]   E X T E S T E R.
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.700]   Yeah it's the parliament wallet
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:32.700]   reviewed it on hands on tech I
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:33.700]   think like three weeks ago.
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:35.700]   Oh yeah they sent me a bunch of
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.700]   emails I probably should have
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.700]   paid attention.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:40.700]   And it has the card slot so it
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:41.700]   holds five cards on the inside
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:42.700]   as well.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:43.700]   Maybe this is my thing.
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:44.700]   No it's not actually my thing.
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:47.700]   But the slot protects against
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.700]   RFID skimming as well.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:50.700]   Yes one two yes.
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:51.700]   So it's kind of you know you
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:52.700]   keep your things in there and
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:53.700]   then when you need them you
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:54.700]   fan them out.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:56.700]   Mine is nice and thin.
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:58.700]   So I think that's a good thing
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.700]   because I think it's a good thing
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.700]   because I think it's a good thing
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.700]   because I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.700]   So the slim wallet for of yours
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.700]   fits four to six cards.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:10.700]   Yeah six extra cards bank notes
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:11.700]   business cards receipts and
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.700]   that's $90 and in yours your
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.700]   parliament with this makes me
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.700]   things of cigarettes is also
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:18.700]   $90.
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:20.700]   All right so if I want to
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:21.700]   switchblade wallet.
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.700]   Oh let's see who's going to
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:24.700]   convince Stacy who's going to
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:25.700]   win this one.
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.700]   So the thing that's happening
[01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:29.700]   on yours is a little more
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:30.700]   satisfying.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:31.700]   It is because it means I can get
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:32.700]   the exact card I want.
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:34.700]   Well I mean this fans are too
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:36.700]   it just doesn't fan it out as
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:37.700]   far.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:38.700]   Oh no.
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:39.700]   All the five cards are fan but
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:40.700]   you've got extra distance.
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:42.700]   And it's very satisfying to go
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:44.700]   to the store and block the wallet
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:46.700]   and just go and pull out the
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:47.700]   thing.
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:48.700]   Yeah it's really nice.
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.700]   I was at the dentist and the
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:51.700]   women behind the car.
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:53.700]   Oh I got to get there for my
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:54.700]   husband and they all.
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:55.700]   Yeah I'm totally buying one of
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:56.700]   these.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.700]   I want to buy one for me right
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.700]   now but that would spoil me
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:46:59.700]   getting it for my husband so I
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:00.700]   have to wait.
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:01.700]   First is the November so if you
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:02.700]   run into him don't tell him
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:03.700]   anything.
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:04.700]   Oh you got to wait.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:05.700]   Oh Stacy your delayed
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.700]   satisfaction here the phone
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:08.700]   doesn't come out November the
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:09.700]   wallet doesn't come out November.
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.700]   You're just you're just biting
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.700]   your gums.
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:14.700]   Yeah yeah my life is just
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.700]   terrible right at this moment.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:16.700]   A giant wait.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:18.700]   But soon you will get to
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:19.700]   marshmallows.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:20.700]   What?
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.700]   Sorry.
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.700]   Sorry that was a reference.
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.700]   Oh that's that psychological
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:25.700]   experiment.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:26.700]   Yes.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:27.700]   Yeah except.
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:28.700]   Oh.
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:30.700]   We never we never sounded the
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:32.700]   end of the Google change log.
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:33.700]   That's because it hasn't ended
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:34.700]   yet.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.700]   Okay we'll end it right now.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:36.700]   Sorry.
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.700]   What do you say we do some tips
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.700]   tricks numbers things whatever
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:44.700]   you happen to have.
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:46.700]   It's about that time.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:47.700]   Let's start with you Stacy.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:48.700]   What's your thing?
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:50.700]   Okay I wanted to do I know that
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.700]   I showed this off.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:53.700]   This is the Amazon echo auto
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.700]   device after three weeks of
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:57.700]   hardcore testing and I thought
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:47:58.700]   I was going to have a story
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:47:59.700]   ready but I didn't finish it in
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.700]   time so my bad.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:03.700]   I'm going to tell you guys do
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:04.700]   not buy this.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:07.700]   It is glitchy and it shows the
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:09.700]   weaknesses of Bluetooth beyond
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.700]   all possible measures.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.700]   And I was so excited this is a
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:15.700]   twenty five dollar device that
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:18.700]   gives you Amazon's echo device.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.700]   So Madam A in your car.
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:23.700]   It runs it works over your
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.700]   phone.
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:26.700]   It connects to your phone via
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:27.700]   Bluetooth.
[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:28.700]   It connects over your car
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:29.700]   speakers via Bluetooth or the
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:30.700]   auxiliary cable depending on
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:31.700]   your car.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:32.700]   There's a list if you scroll
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:34.700]   down in this and the page it's
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:36.700]   a list of the cars that it will
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.700]   work with.
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:39.700]   It will not work with cars that
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:41.700]   like when you're using car play
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.700]   or Amazon sorry car play by
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:46.700]   Apple or Google's what is
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:47.700]   Google's car thing.
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.700]   I'm not sure if I'm going to
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:50.700]   make it up.
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:51.700]   I'm not sure if I'm going to
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:52.700]   make it up.
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:53.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:55.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:56.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:57.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:48:58.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:59.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:00.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:01.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:02.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:03.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:04.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:05.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:06.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:09.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:10.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:11.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:17.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:18.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:19.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:20.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:21.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:24.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:25.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:26.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:27.700]   I'm going to make it up.

[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:52.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:53.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:54.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:55.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:56.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:57.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:58.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:49:59.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:00.700]   I'm going to make it up.

[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:09.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:10.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:12.700]   I'm going to make it up.

[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:21.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:27.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:28.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:29.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:30.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:31.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:32.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:33.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:34.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:35.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:36.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:37.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:38.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:39.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:40.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:42.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:43.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:44.700]   I'm going to make it up.
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:46.700]   They're kind of jealous.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:47.700]   They're kind of cool.
[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:54.200]   My mom has some and she loves hers, but it was hilarious because she wanted -- she was
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.700]   sitting in the living room with my dad while talking to me.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:01.200]   She's like, "Oh, let me put you on speaker so your dad can hear you."
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.700]   But she could not get an off of her headphones.
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:08.140]   She's basically yelling at me.
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:09.420]   My dad can't hear me.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:10.740]   It was really great.
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:12.700]   It took a little bit.
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:17.420]   My husband, we pulled it out of my car, which is the Tesla.
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:20.700]   He put it in his BMW.
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:22.340]   He really wants this to work.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:25.580]   It really does not like him.
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:29.860]   I'm going to say Amazon sending out invites for this thing.
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:32.660]   It's not expensive, but it doesn't work.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:34.660]   It's pretty inexpensive.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:39.660]   It looked like it was on sale for 25, half off normally 50.
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:43.260]   I've only seen it for 25.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.340]   I bought it for 25.
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:50.020]   It's cheap.
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:55.420]   I think if you had your own car that you only drove, it might be okay.
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:57.100]   Although, in my car, it was okay.
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:01.300]   In my husband's car, it was not okay.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.740]   Again, don't recommend it.
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:05.700]   This makes me feel much better.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:09.180]   They sent me an email that said I could use it.
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:10.860]   I was very excited about it.
[01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:12.260]   They sent me an email.
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:19.860]   It went to my email that I never read, except for once a month.
[01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:22.460]   A week later, they said, "No, you can't have it anymore."
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:25.220]   I had to do it again.
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:26.220]   I was very excited.
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.220]   You can have mine if you want.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.220]   No, I don't really want it.
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:30.380]   I don't want it now.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:32.860]   It's not fun.
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:36.540]   I really wanted this to work, so I'm really sad.
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:40.660]   All right, thumbs down on the Echo Auto.
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:42.940]   Jeff, what is your number?
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:44.500]   I like the decisiveness of that Stacey.
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:47.260]   I appreciate that.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.420]   Couple things.
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:54.540]   I can't avoid this one, which was open in the rundown that Marissa
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:58.460]   Meyer bought Tumblr for more than a billion dollars and Met
[01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:02.540]   Mall in Way just bought it for about reports of $3 million.
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:03.540]   But Tumblr lives.
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:04.580]   No porn, folks.
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:06.260]   They come back there saying.
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.260]   But that's cool.
[01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:08.260]   That's one.
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:12.780]   Two is Tom Steyer spent $2.9 million in Facebook ads to get his
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:18.140]   130,000 small donors, which has people saying, "See, you still
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:19.740]   buy elections no matter what.
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:22.220]   All this rule about getting a bunch of small donors, you buy
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.220]   them."
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:27.260]   But the number I really want to mention is 1619.
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.620]   This is 400 years since the first slaves were sold in this
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:30.620]   country.
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:31.620]   It's an important anniversary.
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:35.180]   And the New York Times, under the vision of Nicole Hannah Jones,
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:37.660]   who's a brilliant journalist there, has put together a
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:39.460]   magnificent package for this weekend.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:41.460]   And it's all out today.
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:44.540]   And I suggest you start with Nicole Hannah Jones essay and
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:45.540]   keep going.
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:48.540]   It's a really impressive package and an important thing to
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:50.140]   note and learn from.
[01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:53.380]   I've been hearing a lot about that.
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:55.900]   Yeah, it's a really good package.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:58.100]   I have not finished it, but I have--
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.100]   Yes.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:00.100]   Whoa.
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:01.100]   Indeed, 1619.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.100]   What was that sound?
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.100]   That was--
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.100]   That was a--
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.100]   Do it.
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.660]   That's my workout sound.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:10.660]   It's my whoop.
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.340]   Instead of my whoop, it's my--
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:13.340]   Whoa.
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:14.340]   Although whatever makes that sound--
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:16.340]   That's the name of your wearable.
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.340]   The whoa.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:19.340]   Whoa.
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:21.340]   The whoa belongs to the Marines.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:22.340]   That's true.
[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:23.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:24.340]   A bunch of the stomach.
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:25.340]   That belongs to me.
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:26.340]   Right.
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:27.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:31.820]   My thing is something that I actually just got yesterday,
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:33.500]   and I'm going to be giving it a review.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.860]   I don't have it in here because it's large, and I took it home,
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:40.660]   and thought of unplicking it and bringing it back just seemed
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.140]   like too much this morning.
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:46.540]   But the JBL Linkbar, you may remember hearing about this.
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:50.220]   Not this year at Google I/O, but last year at Google I/O.
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:52.140]   They announced it during the keynote.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:55.860]   It was a collaboration between JBL and Google
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.900]   to create a Linkbar with Android TV,
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:00.260]   and Google Assistant baked into it.
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:04.900]   So essentially, it is a Linkbar Google Home.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:09.940]   And when the TV is off, it's still just a Google Home
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:10.860]   active speaker.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:15.580]   So it's like all the other Google homes throughout your home.
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:18.700]   It just happens to be in the Linkbar format.
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:23.180]   And so I'm curious to play around with it.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:27.900]   Because it has Assistant along with Android TV
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.620]   and connected to your TV, there's
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:33.820]   a lot of possible integrations between using your voice
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:39.380]   to control inputs on your TV and basically control
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:40.340]   all of your media that way.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:42.740]   Which you can do with other devices.
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:44.020]   You could do that with a Shield TV
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:47.900]   if you wanted to get a separate Shield TV for your TV set
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:48.820]   and stuff.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:52.260]   It's not like this is a first, but having it all baked into one
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:54.260]   single device is a little bit different
[01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:56.260]   from what we've seen before.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:58.740]   One downside, though, that I know going in
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:02.620]   as four gigs of onboard storage with absolutely no
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:05.180]   expandable storage option.
[01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:09.060]   So no USB port for expanding storage, no micro SD card slot.
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:13.380]   And if this is a media, if you're running Android TV
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.660]   and you want to install apps on there and everything like that,
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:21.260]   want to put media onto it, like you could a Shield TV, let's say,
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.460]   you're going to run out of space super fast.
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.980]   And I feel like that's a really big downside on this thing.
[01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:28.340]   One Marvel movie.
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:31.060]   Yeah, I mean, that's nothing.
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:32.900]   Don't install any apps if you--
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.380]   I don't know what you do with four gigs
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:36.500]   and I don't know what they were thinking having it just before
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.780]   gigs.
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:39.180]   It's also pretty expensive.
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:41.700]   By itself, it's $3.99.
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:43.500]   And that doesn't include a subwoofer, which
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:46.100]   is an additional $300.
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:53.660]   So it's a pricey sound bar, as far as those are concerned.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.860]   So I don't know if it's necessarily the best,
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:57.940]   but we've been waiting for a while.
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:00.500]   And I'm curious to put it through its paces.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:01.340]   So that's my thing.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:03.500]   You can get it now if you really want to buy it
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.740]   before the review, but maybe wait until after the review.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:08.900]   Maybe I'll inform you on some things that might change your mind
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:11.340]   or make you decide to pull the trigger.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:14.900]   Or you can buy one of Twits 3 Newtons.
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.300]   No, these are coming home.
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:18.660]   With us, we're going to start using it.
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:20.460]   This is going to be actually how the three of us
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.660]   communicate with each other.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.700]   I'm going to send one to each of you,
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.660]   and we're going to keep in touch.
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:26.660]   So we can figure out--
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:28.380]   this is how you figure out your show titles.
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:30.580]   You'll put in a speculative show title,
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:32.820]   and then it will come back with something even better.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:33.300]   Yes.
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.540]   Even more strange.
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:40.060]   Then the Newtons with the cutting edge artificial intelligence
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:41.820]   baked in.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:43.180]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:43.980]   If you would like to hear--
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:49.060]   Call us there and if they say more words about the JBL
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:54.220]   Linkbar, you can go to our new show Hands on Tech.
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:55.060]   Good call.
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:56.060]   Tech 40.
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:59.820]   Episode 40 is all about the JBL Linkbar.
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:00.420]   Yes.
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:03.060]   While you're plugging new shows, don't you
[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:06.420]   want to plug another new show?
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.580]   Maybe.
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:08.780]   Well, no, it's the quiz.
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:10.940]   You just failed.
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:11.380]   Do I?
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:12.340]   He dicks out.
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:16.420]   The boss has a new show, doesn't he?
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:17.420]   Yes.
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:18.260]   That's a tech guy.
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:23.660]   We are asking people to send us tech questions
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:30.740]   for our new show Ask the Tech Guy, which we just set our episode
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:33.740]   zero of today.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:38.260]   Episode one will be premiering on August 26,
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:41.500]   and tweet listeners are encouraged
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:47.060]   to send in tough questions for Leo to answer.
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:50.300]   If you have problems, please ask the tech guy.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:51.860]   One question to show.
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:52.860]   One question to show.
[01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:53.860]   The answer was promised.
[01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:54.700]   Exactly.
[01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:55.220]   That's right.
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:59.180]   Oh, I'm going to ask him about setting up family link
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:03.060]   for my Google accounts and making them all work.
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:04.420]   It's going to blow his mind.
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:05.140]   Do it.
[01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:06.220]   Excellent.
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:10.020]   Twits.tv/atg.
[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:11.980]   We're asked the tech guy.
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:15.060]   There's two Ts there, but I guess they don't count the the as
[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:16.740]   the t.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:20.940]   Twit.tv/atg will take you to the page.
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:22.700]   And there you can find the email address.
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:28.220]   If you want to send in a question, it's askthetechguy@twit.tv.
[01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:31.420]   And yeah, this will be a lot of fun.
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:34.340]   Start in a couple weeks, and thank you for the reminder,
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:38.860]   Jeff, because this news did actually just announce today.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:42.020]   I believe it's on Lisa's Facebook feed.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:44.460]   Leo, of course, doesn't have a Facebook feed,
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:46.820]   but social Lisa has a Facebook feed.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:47.420]   Yes.
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:48.580]   Yes.
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:48.980]   So do it.
[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:49.980]   It's a benefit.
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:54.180]   It's a Twit.tv/atg.
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:54.940]   Thank you all.
[01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:57.860]   Thank you for hopping on today, Jeff.
[01:59:57.860 --> 01:59:59.780]   It was great to see you again.
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:01.540]   I think you were out the last time I was on.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:02.700]   So it's good to see you.
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:03.620]   Yeah, that's great to see you.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:04.580]   Back in your home again.
[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:06.380]   What do you want to leave people with?
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:09.460]   Where can people follow you and all that?
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:10.420]   Oh, nothing.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:10.940]   Nothing.
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:11.620]   They're already here.
[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:12.620]   They're sick of me.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:13.980]   I tell you they're sick of me.
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:14.900]   All right.
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:15.940]   All right, fine.
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:16.740]   Well, it's good to see you.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:19.820]   Also good to see you Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:25.940]   And yeah, so when does this whole marshmallow thing happen?
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:28.260]   OK, so the marshmallow thing that we're talking about
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:31.060]   is a test that psychologists give to kids.
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:33.780]   Proportantly, if you give them the option,
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:35.020]   you put a marshmallow in the table
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:36.620]   and you tell them if they don't eat the marshmallow
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.700]   for like five minutes or something,
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.060]   then they can have two marshmallows.
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:41.380]   So what you're doing is you're trying
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:43.420]   to see if the kids can wait five minutes.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:46.260]   Those that can wait and get two instead of just one
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:50.740]   marshmallow are predisposed to be more successful in school
[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:52.540]   and other things in life.
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:55.500]   So you would wait for the marshmallow then?
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.980]   Oh, for sure, because I am on top of my game.
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:58.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:02.340]   So everybody can send their marshmallows to Stacey.
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:04.660]   I think it was actually a reference to me having
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:07.900]   to wait till November to both buy a wallet and--
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:08.420]   Right.
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:10.540]   --side what phone I buy.
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.140]   But if you have a spare marshmallow,
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:13.500]   send them Stacey's way.
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:15.140]   I'm sure she would appreciate that.
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:15.740]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.060]   Oh, wait.
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:19.380]   No.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:21.500]   I have to tell you, because I saw these in grocery stores,
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:23.820]   pro tip for anybody who makes s'mores.
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:26.540]   They now have s'mores-shaped marshmallows.
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:27.820]   They're thinner than normal.
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:28.340]   That takes more.
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.260]   And they're square-shaped.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:30.900]   OK, that's all.
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:31.980]   It's not fair.
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:33.740]   But they're not melted yet.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:35.020]   They're not melted yet.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:39.700]   But there is a shape that they're optimized for s'more making.
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.780]   It's warming.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.620]   I have a non-sequitur for everything, you guys.
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:46.220]   S'mores make--
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:48.140]   Once you smoosh the marshmallow, it's heavy.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.180]   You smoosh the marshmallow.
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:51.180]   It's not going to form.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:53.580]   So what happens is, you know when your marshmallow catches
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.060]   on fire on the outside and it's all gooey,
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:56.580]   but the inside's still a little cool?
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:57.100]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:57.600]   Yeah.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:58.100]   Yeah.
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:01:58.420]   So this shade--
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:59.900]   --that's just a bad at it.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:00.860]   Hey, it's not harsh.
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:02.060]   It's true.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:04.140]   Do not judge.
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:04.780]   That's true.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.780]   It's got a point.
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:06.500]   It's s'mores.
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:09.500]   However, if you're bad at making s'mores,
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:12.780]   they have a marshmallow whose surface area is larger.
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:16.940]   And overall volume is still the same, possibly even more.
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:19.180]   And you can, you know, about the whole thing
[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:19.820]   all the way through.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.180]   Wow.
[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:23.140]   Since we're talking about s'mores,
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:27.020]   I was camping last weekend.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:31.060]   And I saw a kid walking around with a waffle cone.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:32.780]   And I was like, what's in the waffle cone?
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:35.420]   And she said, it's a s'more, the s'more inside of a waffle
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:36.500]   cone.
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:37.700]   I'm going camping this weekend.
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:38.420]   And we are totally--
[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:40.140]   That kind of sounds amazing, doesn't it?
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:41.140]   Amazing.
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:42.500]   Sounds really good.
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:43.940]   I'll report back next week.
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:45.380]   All right, cool.
[02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:47.540]   Keep us posted.
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:52.300]   We do the show, or we, or Leo, he'll be back next week.
