[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Stacey has the week off, but Glenn Fleischman's here.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.900]   He's always a lot of fun. He's joining at Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:18.600]   There is a lot to talk about the new bills or regulations in the EU and how they will affect Google, Apple, and all of big tech.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200]   That's going to be a big story and there's a lot to talk about there.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.800]   Why flat earthers are never going to change their mind, how they paint ceramics,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.200]   and what to do about meat sweats. It's all coming up next. Yeah, I know.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   It's time for Twig.

[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.900]   we cover Apple today. We've got a lot of good subjects and we're very happy to say Glenn Fleischman is here,
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900]   filling in for Stacey Higginbotham. Hello Glenn.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900]   Hello, you can't seem to get rid of me.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.900]   It was a star on Sunday's Twitter, which was great fun. Thank you.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.900]   And we've saved a few stories for your visit today. So,
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.900]   flong away.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.900]   We also have of course, and Pruitt hands on photography. Hello, Ant.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   Hello, Mr. LaPorte. Welcome back.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.900]   Community manager at the club. Thank you. And I do owe a thanks to Jeff Jarvis who ran the show as a democracy last week.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.900]   Great.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.900]   Not that much of a democracy, but
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   Benito has joined us as our board op. He's going to be, are you going to be a predator, Benito?
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.900]   Are you going to do all three, the editing, the producing and the technical direction and you can do all of that?
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.900]   Oh, not today. Just soon. So we welcome Benito.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.900]   And Benito was going to throw to the deep end last week.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900]   Oh, he was here last week. Oh, yeah.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.900]   I want to thank the folks out there who said nice things on Twitter about my week in Congress.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.900]   What was with the giant cheater though? I heard about that.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.900]   That was amazing.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.900]   So we have it in the run down today too.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.900]   You got all over the big story of the week, which is attack after a row.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.900]   And then we, you know, wanted a little lighter moment.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.900]   So the big cheater bell announced a 16 times larger Cheeto Tostado. Tostado.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.900]   Cheez it. Not Cheeto, I guess. Cheez it. Thank you.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   That would be fun though. Right.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.900]   16 times the larger Cheeto would be fun too. You could float in the pool with it. Yeah.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.900]   Jeff, Jeff, and I'll show you, I'll show you Benito when you play that.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   Jeff is the Leonard town professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.900]   Craig.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.900]   School of journalism at the city university of New York, perfectly performed
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.900]   by our coral group who is now going out for cigarettes.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.900]   We continue with the Boris Johnson watch Alexander Boris to Fifele Johnson.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.900]   Oh my gosh. He says, I will not quit.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.900]   So that's a, I know we've lost all of our British viewers are watching, watching
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   the tube as he will fight on the benches. He will fight on the benches.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   I will fight them in the bushes. I will fight them at 10 downing parties.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   Right. Blood. He's going to, he's putting the queen in an uncomfortable position,
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900]   like some kind of chess player. Oh, really? Does the queen, how does the queen get?
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.900]   Yeah. Well, there's this whole issue about dissolving Parliament, which if he
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.900]   calls for the queen to do it, she has limited choices and some of which could
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   produce a constitutional crisis about the nature of the monarchy. So she probably won't,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   but it's a kerfuffle or an adieu. This was happening in Canada, the pro rogue,
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.900]   which is to discontinue a session of Parliament without dissolving it.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.900]   And I remember this was a big thing in Canada because the queen is the titular
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.900]   head of the Canadian government as well. Is she still? Yeah.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.900]   It's a common to Jamaica. Jamaica. She got Jamaica. She's got Australia.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.900]   She's a river from Jamaica. Girl, I need it. Anyway, monarch. We will continue to
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.900]   follow that story. Although we will not show any videos of Queen Elizabeth
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.900]   and Paddington the bear because this show is still held hostage by the
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.900]   city. Yeah, still is. Studio Canal. No. No, no, no, no. You may not show any
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.900]   videos of Paddington the bear with that express recognition. Oh, I'm sorry. It's my fault.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.900]   The commissioner major league baseball. I guess we'll do one row story, but just one.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.900]   Because it is still an issue and Google has now said there is this data loophole
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.900]   about location developers can see where you are. So they're going to stop sending
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.900]   your visits to a variety of places, including abortion clinics. Stop recording
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.900]   those. It'll turn off the recording. And the developers apparently have an
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:12.900]   ability to see other apps on the phone. So this is a big deal. Google has allowed
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.900]   thousands of companies to monitor and sell personal data from Android smart phones.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.900]   It took a further step on Friday to limit the smartphone data that could be used to
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.900]   police new abortion restrictions, automatically deleting location history
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   and phones that are close to a sensitive medical location. But also there's this
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:41.900]   issue of apps checking to see whether apps are installed. So I guess they want to
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.900]   that's a little sensitive. I don't think they should have allowed in the first place.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.900]   Collecting Google said in March 2021, we announced a plan to restrict access to
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.900]   this permission so that only utility apps such as device search, anti-virus and
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.900]   file manager apps can see what other apps are installed on the phone. Collecting app
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.900]   inventory data to sell it or share it for analytics or ads monetization purposes
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.900]   has never been allowed. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen. They just, you know,
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.900]   we catch you. So there you have it.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   Query all packages will be restricted from July 12th.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   The other big story, and this one, I feel like we got to get the Internet's
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:34.900]   lawyer on for this or something, but the EU has now approved two big regulations
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.900]   that will very much impact Google. The Digital Services Act.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:48.900]   The Digital Markets Act. There are two of them, DMA and DSA.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:57.900]   The DMA is more about competition and I think that's the one that's going to
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.900]   probably more affect Google, but Google will be affected by both of them.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.900]   It says that digital service, quote, gatekeepers who break the laws for
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   promoting competition, the law says these companies must obtain explicit
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.900]   consent to target ads based on personal data. That's, of course, completely
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   undermines Google's model.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.900]   Underminds most media companies. Underminds most of the entire media business now.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.900]   It'll be interesting to see what Google does about this. It requires
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.900]   interoperability between messaging platforms. Of course, that's probably
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.900]   targeted at Apple's iMessage, which is very much a closed.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.900]   Well, also targeted at Facebook.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.900]   Facebook.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.900]   That is true.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.900]   What's app? Yeah.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.900]   Although it's good for meta. If what's app can interoperate with Apple's
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.900]   messages, that's very good for meta. Really, Apple has this monopoly on
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   iPhones with messaging. Highly complex.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.900]   It also says that large platforms must let, and this affects Apple more than
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.900]   Google because you can choose browsers on Android. Let users select a browser,
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.900]   search engine, and personal voice assistant of their choice. Although
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.900]   Google is very much involved because Google pays, it is estimated between
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.900]   $10 and $12 billion a year to Apple to be the default search engine on
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:21.900]   Safari on iPhones. Apple does not let any other browser use its own engine.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.900]   You have to use WebKit, the Safari engine on iPhone. So really, Safari has
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.900]   been an monopoly on iPhone with everything but the UI. And you can change
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.900]   search engines, but as you know, the default is going to be always the dominant
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   search engine. So Google pays a lot for that.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.900]   I think Apple's been quietly building a search engine too. I mean, if I look at
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.900]   my logs on my server, I'll sometimes see massive queries from Apple addresses
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.900]   for various pages of site to separate. So I, you know, like so many things in Apple,
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.900]   they've got things in the lab that they roll out when they're convenient.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.900]   And I think they probably got enough storage and data capacity to run a search engine
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.900]   if they had to for their customers.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:06.900]   So you can have a robots.txt that will allow Apple visiting or block it.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.900]   That's interesting. I did not, I haven't looked at my logs in all that.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.900]   Yeah, I don't know. I sometimes see I have relatively low-end server, virtual server.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.900]   So occasionally people go get out over XLS and I have to put in some blocks and I
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.900]   have software that's like, "Hey, Apple just requested, you know, 50,000 pages."
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.900]   And I'm like, "Oh, they probably need to not be doing that."
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.900]   I had no idea they were spidering. That's very interesting.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.900]   Well, did you know about, I didn't know why this has been around for a while.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.900]   I didn't know what Common Crawl...
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.900]   I do not know about Common Crawl.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.900]   What is that?
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.900]   CommonCrawl.org is an open crawl of the web.
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.900]   I'm not saying Apple's going to use that.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.900]   Anybody can access it.
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.900]   But anybody can access it.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.900]   No, interesting.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.900]   Isn't this really interesting?
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.900]   This is...
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.900]   Because I've been playing a lot with the GPT-3 and writing about Lambda and all of that.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.900]   This is the kind of stuff you use as the...
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   For your data set.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.900]   The data set, right. Thank you.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:10.900]   So I'm not saying that's that, but Crawling used to be this high art and difficult barrier
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.900]   to go over for functionality of other applications.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.900]   I think it's...
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.900]   Not such a big deal.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.900]   I think it still is.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.900]   I think Google...
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.900]   I think so.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.900]   The full pool of quality you got.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.900]   Yes.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.900]   They really are only to search engines.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.900]   Google and Bing.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.900]   Everything else is derivative.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   I mean, you can go to DuckDuckGo.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.900]   They say this.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.900]   It's Sam Laughs.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.900]   You said Bing went ahead.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.900]   Go far.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   It's one and a half.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.900]   Yeah, I always laugh at your Bing.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.900]   You just came off Windows Weekly so he has to suppress his natural view of...
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.900]   Don't you have a...
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.900]   Don't you have Jonathan Mann's Bing song just queued up to go anytime?
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.900]   I should.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.900]   Right.
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.900]   It's a song of days.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.900]   Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing goes the internet.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.900]   It would be meaningless if it weren't the default search engine in Microsoft Windows.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.900]   And I think because, again, the tyranny of the default, people don't change things.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.900]   Bing is still pretty important.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.900]   It's not.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.900]   I mean, you know what?
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:12.900]   Google does not want Bing not to succeed because that's the same reason Microsoft wanted
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.900]   to have more work.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.900]   Anti-trust stuff.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.900]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.900]   You can't quite uply say, "Oh, we're not a monopoly, your honor."
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   Okay.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.900]   Even in the EU where they are much more dominant, Google is only about 80% of the browser market.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.900]   I think it's only 60% in the US.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.900]   I am a funny.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.900]   I don't know if it's exactly a technical question.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.900]   I mean, we've all been around the block a few million times.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.620]   And I feel like it shouldn't be that hard to make a search engine.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.900]   And I don't mean that in like this fast-style, "Well, there's not that many...
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.300]   It's not the big deal."
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.420]   But the internet kind of stabilized, right?
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.860]   There's a lot of storage, storage relatively cheap, computational power is relatively cheap.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.980]   There are companies out there with piles of money who don't know what to do to reinvest
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.980]   it.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.420]   I actually don't understand why somebody...
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.020]   I mean, Apple is a likely candidate, as I say, but it's not an intractable problem the
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.060]   way it was when you literally couldn't buy enough servers to stick in racks fast enough
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.820]   to keep up with the growth of the net.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.860]   And a lot of sites are programmatically driven now.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.340]   They're database-driven.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.260]   So when you go to Amazon, it's a whole different matter now than when it seemed like a million
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.260]   static pages.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.380]   It's a 500 million database-driven pages.
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.380]   So I don't know.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.300]   I feel like there's something you got this thing.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.660]   Is there not enough money to extract it?
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.180]   You got a billion dollars a year, Glenn, because that's the estimate of how much it
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.180]   goes.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.180]   We can ask Elon Musk.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.180]   I think he's probably...
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.180]   So there are some...
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.180]   But you're also dealing with spam.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.180]   You're dealing with spam.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.180]   There are many companies that can do this.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.620]   You're trying to intuit the content, the topicality of the content.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.620]   It's not just...
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.620]   No, all truths.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.620]   There's more.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.380]   Enough computer scientists have invented enough AI work.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.620]   I mean, is there enough work of all kinds out there?
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.620]   It was doable.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.620]   Yeah, it's expensive.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.620]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.620]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.900]   But expensive at the scale of where you have trillion dollar companies and Microsoft's engine
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.780]   is not great, even though the company's been executing a lot of other ways very well.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.300]   Bing is not great.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.780]   And DuckDuckGo is kind of a weird...
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.300]   The fact that it's emerged so much because of privacy issues in a world in which there
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.540]   are trillion dollar companies that could throw a billion dollars a year at a problem.
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.500]   If they felt like there was a return.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   I don't know.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.460]   I feel like I'm missing a piece.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.940]   Another way to put it, Glenn, is what's the next generation of search?
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:20.180]   So I think what you're talking about is search as we know it, like phones, has been static
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.380]   for a while.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.380]   You're totally right.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   And a world...
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.500]   Have you been around the block a few times, as you say, world enough to remember the advance
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:34.980]   that Google was on fast and on altovista at all, right?
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.140]   But what was different about it was, of course, PageRank was about seeing understanding the
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.820]   world differently.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.060]   And I think that there are frontiers to be had when you get to things like quality or
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.940]   relevance or authority that are much harder problems to attack, which I would hope that
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.220]   Google would be the one attacking because I don't think they're really a company is
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.300]   set in their ways.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.780]   But is search done?
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.220]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.220]   Or are there new frontiers?
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.220]   No, that's...
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.300]   I mean, that's where you get into Siri and voice assistants where maybe the issue is...
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.300]   I mean, it's nice.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.300]   I still laugh because I've got an iPhone.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.140]   I'm a very Apple-committed person.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.340]   And I'm trying to get Siri where it likes it around watching TV, the family, and somebody
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.340]   asks the question.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.300]   I'm like, "Oh, Siri gives me a lousy answer."
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.300]   I'm like, "All right.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.620]   I'm going to launch my Google app because I know when I use voice recognition on Google,
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.660]   its response will be even better than if I typed it in on the Google app and I get the
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.660]   answer I want."
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.860]   So that's kind of it, is Google feels more advanced in that sort of query?
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.860]   Even though Apple, I know really...
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.260]   I mean, there's a lot of companies that would love to be the master of that new domain, right?
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.620]   Well, you're saying there's a lot of companies that would love to be the master.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.780]   Who are some of those companies?
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.860]   Because there's only going to be a handful of them that can afford it.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.860]   Number one.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.860]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.660]   And number two, is it a big enough return on the investment?
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.940]   Google is making a ton of money.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.620]   Why would someone leave Google if there was a new search engine that's out there?
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.980]   I think that's one of the reasons there's all that conversations about what's next because
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.740]   nobody wants to go head to head against Google.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.020]   It's not merely the billion dollars a year you'd have to spend to spider than that.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.460]   There's also, Google's been doing it for 20 years.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.900]   So they have a huge amount of track, record history.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.500]   Do queries are your value?
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.540]   They are queries are the value.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:25.580]   So I think probably, and by the way, to get back to our original subject, with the EU
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.580]   getting involved, with the EU and getting involved in regulating all of this, you might
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.140]   think twice before saying, I'm going to plunge a billion dollars a year plus whatever software
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.940]   development costs are to do this.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.180]   Brave says they're doing a search engine.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.380]   DuckDuckGo says they're doing a search engine.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.740]   But none of these attempts, I think, really compete with Bing and Google.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:55.100]   By the way, just so you know, I looked it up, Bing, Google in the US is a 70% market share.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.780]   Well, Bing is 13.3%.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:05.780]   Maybe this must be global because Baidu is in there at 12.5% and Yahoo still around at
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.780]   2%.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:12.340]   I don't know if that's even fair to say because Yahoo is based on Bing.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.420]   But Google has helped pretty steady for desktop.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.380]   Now, that might be a little bit different if you look at mobile.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.020]   I think we can do that, I think.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.460]   Device type.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.460]   Change that.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.780]   Google is not stressing mobile.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.140]   Wow, Google's even more dominant mobile, almost 95%.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.780]   Okay, never mind.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.580]   Never mind.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.660]   Alright, I guess the question, I mean, it's just kind of one of those things about like
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.300]   why does time travel exist?
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.540]   Well, if it did, we probably would have already seen time travelers.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.140]   So maybe you can't have another good search engine one that competes with Google because
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.860]   it would have happened by now before they should have to kill your grandfather.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.380]   That's why the Google grandfather, apparently.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.220]   Don't Google your grandfather.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.940]   No, I've asked that question.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.500]   It's a really good question, Glenn, is why isn't there competition?
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.980]   It would is clearly a very profitable.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:11.260]   If Google can afford to give Apple $12 billion a year just so that it's the default search
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.940]   engine on iPhones, there's a lot of money.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.940]   A lot of cash.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.540]   A lot of cash flow being driven by a browser.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.140]   Clearly, though, I think it's fair to say, and Google's been in trouble for a while,
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.780]   favoring its own properties.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:32.740]   And that's one of the things that DMA is particularly there to fight against.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.180]   This is, of course, in this way, it works in the EU because of complaints from, you
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.620]   know, remember Google's shopping?
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.060]   People complain about that.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.540]   Yelp complains about Google reviews, that kind of thing.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:52.780]   So it comes from competitors, but it is now official, the Digital Markets Act.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:19:00.620]   The Digital Services Act only affects platforms with 45 million monthly active users.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.620]   So it's pretty much aimed at Facebook and Twitter, I guess.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.540]   Twitter might just skate it under that.
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:12.460]   If Google had Google+, maybe, I don't know.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:23.820]   So the DSA puts responsibility on platforms to police and take down illegal content.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.660]   The problem is what is illegal speech?
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.100]   This is what, of course, Elon Musk has been trying to figure out.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.900]   Well, you're giving him more credit than he is, too.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:39.740]   Google and Apple, both are going to have problems with their app stores because of the Digital
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.740]   Markets Act.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.580]   This can be very interesting.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:49.740]   Now, one story I saw from Reuters said the EU has approved these regulations, but hasn't
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.220]   funded them, and so enforcement may lag.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.460]   The fines are significant.
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.860]   The fines for violations of the Digital Markets Act up to 10 percent of global revenue for
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.980]   the Digital Services Act, 6 percent of global revenue.
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.980]   That's billions, obviously.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.980]   And then that's just a...
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.700]   Unless you are bad, then it goes up to 20 percent.
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.140]   Yeah, if you do it again, whew.
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.140]   But the question remains, you know, GDPR wasn't enforced right away.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.140]   Yes.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.140]   But did have its impact, didn't it?
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.420]   Well, did it, though?
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.180]   I was just reading an article I wish I could remember immediately just a few days ago about
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.460]   the impact of GDPR and that there were a lot of initial complaints.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.780]   There was the perception something would change, and then very little has actually happened.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.380]   I mean, some people blame it partly on the pandemic because it produced kind of, you
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.300]   know, molasses flow in the EU, which was focused on other things.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:45.060]   But did the GDPR do anything but give us more disabled access to EU residents from resources
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.960]   that weren't GDPR compliant and put more...
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.220]   Except all these various cookies messages, like even more complicated ones on our screen.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.020]   I don't know that I would love to find the list of the fines.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.900]   I think in the end, no one's been fined extremely, and I think some complaints are now four
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.660]   years old in the system without having been fully acted upon, including some of the earlier
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.660]   months ago.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.660]   Yeah, I also saw...
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.660]   Sorry, Glenn.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.660]   I also saw...
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.660]   No, no, no.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.660]   Maybe it's the same one you saw that I can't find it either.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.940]   I thought I bookmarked it.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.460]   That it basically benefited Google.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.740]   That's all the small guys.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:23.340]   You know, as happens in these regulatory moments, the capture is the big guys can afford to
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.500]   deal with whatever it is.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   Okay, fine.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   We'll deal with it.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.140]   But new competition is harmed.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.540]   I want to argue that Wired Magazine, how GDPR is failing from May, Matt Burgess, that's
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.100]   the story.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.100]   And I think that was a conclusion.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.100]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:44.460]   I have to say, I might disagree with that because, for instance, we wouldn't have the
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.740]   California Privacy Protection Act without GDPR.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:56.340]   It emboldened California legislator to follow suit.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.940]   I don't know if failing is the right word.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.740]   It's also early days.
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.260]   Things move very, very slowly.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.340]   I mean, this is one reason Google probably doesn't have to worry about the DMA and the
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.620]   DSA so much right away because it may take a decade to litigate this all.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.580]   And these big companies absolutely will fight it every stage.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.300]   Unless I'm wrong here, each country will do its version.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.300]   It's the other thing.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.300]   This is what's happened with it.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.780]   And so they'll be litigated separately.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.500]   It's so complicated.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:31.180]   But there have been quite a few, I think there have been quite a few actions based on GDPR
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.500]   that have been taken by the Netherlands, by France.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.740]   I mean, I think that these things are happening.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.540]   It's not the sky is falling.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.340]   It's taking a while.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.540]   I should say actions should divide that because I think the thing this article focused
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.140]   on and that's what reminded me is back when the GDPR passed, you had individuals and some
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.740]   groups file complaints immediately.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.900]   And some of those complaints four years later remain completely unresolved.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.900]   Right.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.420]   So that was so the penalty part may have lacked, but I am totally, I will back up on my words
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:07.220]   because as we know in 2018 and it's happened in successive years, two other things have
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.740]   happened similarly, a lot of the big companies double click and Google and advertising networks,
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.540]   Microsoft's advertising division, they had a completely retool what they were doing to
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.100]   be as compliant as possible.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.060]   So even if they were spotted, yeah, the complaints have necessarily gone through, but they changed
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.740]   their entire method of doing business to the extent they thought they had to.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.060]   And so the question is, do they have to do more?
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.100]   And the complaints process was supposed to provide a check on that.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.720]   I don't think the complaints process was working, but the incentive of there is now
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.300]   a law in place that will affect you.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   You need to make sure.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.340]   Well, from the same Wired article, Luxembourg is fined Amazon 746 million euros.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.060]   That's not an insignificant amount.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   What's the word?
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   What's the word?
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.180]   Well, Amazon has its operations ostensibly.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:54.140]   They probably reap, you know, $100 billion in revenue is recorded in Luxembourg or something,
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.140]   right?
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.140]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.820]   Ireland fired what's filed, find WhatsApp 225 million euros last year.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.500]   Both decisions under appeal and that's what happens is it drags on.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:13.940]   So you know, in some, we go back and forth on this show all the time, Glenn, about what
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.180]   the remedy is for big tech.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:24.980]   We talked on the show on Sunday about the negatives versus the positives of tech.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:30.020]   And of course, that's something Jeff's always reminding us that the net is probably positive
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.100]   of big tech.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   And the prosecution of these things is very slow, but we'd have to do something.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.900]   I don't think big tech should get to decide what's okay and what's not okay, right?
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.500]   You want government to?
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.700]   Yes, that's our speech.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.940]   I want to speak.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.460]   No, no, I want society to and government is the arm of society.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:25:00.900]   Well, no, government is is interested parties and we have a first amendment for a reason.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.380]   And I'm glad we do.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.540]   Well, then it's not right now.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.900]   So how is society in force of fetish?
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:12.060]   So you stipulate through the market, through norms, it's slow, it's difficult, but it's
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.020]   the way it has to way it's happened since get ready, folks, get your glass ready.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.500]   Get your glass ready.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.020]   Get your word.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.020]   Drinking here.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.900]   That's how we do on this show, Mr. Mr. Glaing.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.140]   I feel like you're right.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.380]   I mean, government's imperfect, but it is dangerous.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.860]   It's dangerous and I'm a Democrat.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.860]   I'm not a libertarian.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.860]   Let's be very clear here.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.500]   When it comes to speech, look what's happening in Florida and look what's happening in Texas
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.140]   where they're trying to impose noxious speech.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:50.100]   We're we're the governor of Florida is trying to tell teachers what they can and cannot
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.700]   say we're in Texas.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.900]   They wouldn't tell teachers they can't say slavery has to be forced relocation.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.900]   That's when government gets involved in speech.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.900]   For sure.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.700]   Okay, I missed that.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.700]   Incinvience.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:11.420]   I'm guessing Mr. report would play devil's advocate here and say society is is in a
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.300]   fluency in the government.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.660]   Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.460]   It's what you could say.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.460]   I guess you could.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:26.020]   I mean, geez, having great faith in the invisible hand of the free market is probably just as
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.780]   foolish as having great faith in God.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.620]   I'm not saying I'm faith and I'm just saying it's what it's what ends up happening that
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:38.180]   efforts to I've got a whole chapter in the book about this efforts to censor almost inevitably
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.980]   lead to unintended consequences and and ill government regulation does not have to mean
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.980]   censorship.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:49.700]   In fact, this DSA and this DMA seemed not to be about censorship, but about trying to
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.340]   keep it competitive for smaller companies, right?
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.540]   That's different from speech.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.660]   I didn't say anything about speech.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.500]   I didn't say anything on speech.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.620]   I'm merely saying that it is the realm of the appropriate for society to express its
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.420]   desires from these companies through government action through regulation.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.460]   That is the most direct means we have.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.660]   The force of market forces aren't necessarily very effective in norms.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.500]   What the hell are you talking about norms?
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.660]   Can I throw another log on the fire here, which is just that the latest trend has been
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.500]   to use citizen enforcement through civil action.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.100]   So which is horrible.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.100]   I agree.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.620]   Technically enabled by government, but it's civil action and then individuals are involved
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.020]   and there's monetary damages typically, right?
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:39.100]   In California, if somebody is on the pro- like a second amendment maximalist track, you
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.820]   can look to California and say, "Well, if you like, say, the restriction of speech
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.900]   in some areas, the restriction of certain constitutional rights through private lawsuits,
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.820]   well, in California, it may impose a law that would allow people to sue over certain
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.140]   aspects of gun ownership on a private basis using the same principle and have the same
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.140]   outcome."
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:00.900]   So it's a double-edged sword there, too, is if the government enables individual action
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:07.460]   to sort of pursue as an arm of government, and the California Privacy Act is you have
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.620]   to have a stake there, right?
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.620]   You have the law like the Texas abortion law and the California is proposed like gun-related
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.620]   law.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:20.380]   Those both give you standing just by being a member, somebody in the state, right?
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.900]   But the California Privacy Act, you have the standing because you want to get information
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.820]   from a company, a company's done, you harm.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:30.620]   So that direct connection gives you both a reason to do something and a reason for state
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.820]   mechanisms to act partly on your behalf, right?
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.260]   And a company to be penalized for it.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.940]   But I think we're moving to an era in which private actors may be enabled to take essentially
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:45.820]   quasi-governmental action by using lawsuits, which is, I don't think it's great.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.580]   I don't think we all agree that's a terrible idea.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.340]   But being tried out hasn't had Supreme Court doesn't seem to have it a opinion on it yet,
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.340]   which is also terrifying.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.900]   I think, as my understanding, that that was the intent of the Texas legislature is to
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.980]   end around the Supreme Court, right?
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.580]   They don't have to do that anymore thanks to the road.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.140]   Exactly.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.140]   So that was a...
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.260]   Look, when the soldiers are being...
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.180]   When we start dealing with fourth amendment right, is a fourth amendment right?
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.980]   The quartering soldier in your house is then you're going to have complaint.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.660]   Then we're going to have a problem here.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.220]   We do not talk enough about the fourth amendment.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.620]   I might have a spear before.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.300]   We'll be covering women trying to get abortions in our house instead.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.780]   Oh, yeah, exactly.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:30.900]   So, Jeff, you feel your entire alliance on reigning in big tech should be...
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.620]   No, I was going to get enormous.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.380]   I was going on my speech rant.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.620]   I thought that's what you were talking about.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:47.700]   No, but there was a great paper by James Doer at the Rand Corporation in the '80s in which
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.180]   he argued looking back at, "I'm going to do it again, folks.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.180]   Get ready."
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:30:00.180]   It is a print in Gutenberg that countries that tried to control print fell behind, societally,
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.780]   fell behind in many ways.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.580]   Well, the speech is a very...
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.980]   Speeches as the internet is filled with...
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.980]   Special thing.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.980]   Unintended consequences.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.980]   Speech is a very special thing.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.980]   And a...
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.980]   Speech is special.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:10.980]   But even beyond that, government...
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:16.220]   I mean, GDPR, I think you're right, it's causing other things like California, but GDPR
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.140]   is clumsily and badly written.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.140]   Who?
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.140]   It has issues.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.100]   How do we...
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:28.220]   Let's say, can we all agree that we should control our data and not big companies?
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.140]   We should have a say in what happens to you.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.380]   What does that mean, though, Lee?
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.380]   It means that I should say...
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.380]   But you buy something on Amazon.
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.380]   You buy something on Amazon.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.860]   Amazon has a right to know what you bought.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.980]   You are in a transaction with someone.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.700]   That's so for you to say, "I own that."
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.940]   Well, no, you only own half of that.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.940]   It's fine.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:50.100]   But if my internet service provider is selling a list of websites I visit to Amazon, then
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.820]   I should have some control over that.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.220]   Also arguably, you could do something like proxy buying.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.220]   Like, what if...
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.340]   I'm not suggesting that we put this into effect.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.540]   But it's kind of like drop shipping.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.380]   What if we could order from Amazon, they never saw who we were.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.460]   All they knew was a charge had been approved in an anonymous fashion.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.860]   And when they sent it to a shipper to go out, the shipper wouldn't disclose to Amazon my
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.860]   address.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.420]   I mean, that's not infeasible, and it's actually done for certain kinds of purchases.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.900]   I think honestly...
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.540]   In most cases, people's interest that Amazon knows you buy it so that you could return
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.860]   it so that you could complain about it.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.860]   But it's plausible.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.260]   You could have an entirely proxy-based system which Amazon...
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.260]   I understand.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.260]   I mean, that's an extreme.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.260]   But it's not infeasible.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.860]   I think I would go the middle ground, which say, "It's fine for Amazon to know about a
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.540]   transaction I have."
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.940]   That's a first-party transaction.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.940]   That's fine.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.860]   It's the collection of data by third parties and the selling on to other people that people
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.140]   are really concerned about.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:54.740]   Can we agree that there should be some means of us as consumers controlling that?
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.580]   There isn't currently.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.740]   The only way to stop that would be regulation, I think.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.300]   I don't have a choice of which ISP I use.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.780]   That's a monopolistic market.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.340]   So I mean, there's...
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.500]   I don't think there are a lot of reason why it came to...
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.100]   I can't use the free market to say, "Oh, I don't want to use Comcast.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.980]   I don't have a reasonable choice."
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.780]   Well, that's a different question.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.780]   That's a whole...
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:21.780]   That's a full-of-follow way.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.780]   Yes.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.300]   I mean, why can't that be fixed?
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.300]   Why not fix that first point?
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.700]   Well, I agree that should be fixed as well.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.300]   There's some other stuff.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.260]   But I also think that I should also have the right to tell Comcast, "Stop looking at what
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.900]   I'm doing."
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.860]   We have just as you talked about Glenn, these drop-shipping, we have technical means to
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.180]   hide our tracks from our service providers.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.860]   But I think it should be illegal.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.860]   All right, let's use something that's even more topical.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:55.660]   Shouldn't it be illegal for a period tracking app to sell that data on to third parties,
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:01.500]   not just TAMPx, but maybe some citizen in Texas that wants to sue?
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.460]   Should that not be illegal?
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.700]   Are you saying market forces and norms should stop that?
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.700]   Because it's not doing a good job.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.700]   All right, good job.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.780]   We imagine that if it gets out that any such app is doing that, then every single user
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.780]   would stop using it.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:18.700]   So market forces would probably be ahead of a two-year legislative process.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.700]   That's all.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:27.060]   I'm not saying you can't pass the law fine, but if it's found out that that's occurring
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.260]   and that they're doing an app to serve women.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.500]   All right, I guess what it comes down to, you're right.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.980]   But what comes down to me is it feels like there are wrong things to do, like an app
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:40.980]   developer.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.100]   That's wrong for them to do that.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:51.620]   And that it's appropriate for government to make a law against something that's wrong.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.860]   And I kind of want them to.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.260]   And it shouldn't be incumbent on you.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.260]   You watch the hearings.
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.860]   It shouldn't be incumbent on me to figure out that, oh, this is happening.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   It's opaque.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.860]   It's not obvious it's happening.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.620]   The only reason we know it's happening is because we have a strong independent press
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.900]   that reports on it.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.540]   Otherwise, we would not know.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.460]   And that's your best protection, Leo.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.060]   I mean, I guess you watch the hearings.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.060]   I think it's all of the above.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.060]   And they're idiots.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.060]   I think it's all of the above.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.820]   But if you're going to depend, right, so good.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:21.820]   Fine, agreed.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:26.100]   Because if you're going to depend upon government, no, but you want to, it sounds like you want
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.060]   to take that weapon out of the yards.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.620]   No, I don't want to take that weapon out.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.060]   And we've done this on the show.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.620]   I'm like a bore.
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:36.700]   I think there's different models for it because it's a rapidly changing world.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.460]   And when I was on the transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation freedom
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.460]   of expression on the internet.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:50.820]   The group, which included former head of DHS, former president of Estonia, Estonia, a lot
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.300]   of researchers, a part of it I am.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:35:03.060]   What we came up with at the end was a recommendation of accountability through transparency.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:09.580]   The form of the regulation should take is to demand that platforms hand over data to researchers
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.860]   so we know the impact is.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.940]   Now, I go one step beyond what the group did.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:19.980]   And I think that they should be required to make statements of what they warrant to their
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.180]   users and they can be held accountable for it.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.380]   As the FTC would hold you accountable for, if you make a microphone and say that it will
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:34.500]   make you all, as all sound like Leo de Porte and how happy and it doesn't, then the FTC
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.740]   says, we're not going to tell you, I make a microphone, but you lied and we're going
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.580]   to hold you accountable for that.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.700]   So the question becomes, yes, government should hold you accountable, but to what?
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.460]   To what standard?
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.820]   And to have one standard for all online companies doesn't make as much sense as saying they
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.260]   should be held accountable for the warrants they make and they should make warrants and
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.260]   they're not making them.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.340]   Sorry we dragged you into this, Glenn.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.820]   I love this stuff.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.820]   I love this stuff.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.620]   It's challenging to figure out what you do about it.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:10.420]   And I think my point of view is coming from this kind of injured party, but it's wrong
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.500]   and there ought to be a law.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:25.540]   I fear that Jeff is kind of the Robert McNamara of, oh geez, oh geez.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:33.700]   You kind of the best and the brightest establishment saying, oh no, no, let the people decide and
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.420]   it's not going to, nothing's going to happen and we're going to end up in a quagmire.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.060]   I've already heard the Rand Corporation cited that number of weeks.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.420]   We even like in the 60s.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.140]   It's the band of our Bush on the show for his opinion.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:55.300]   Yeah, I just remember this notion of the best and the brightest, right?
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.980]   The bureaucrats who ended up getting us into a lot of trouble in the 60s.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.980]   We can win.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.220]   That was government by the way.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.220]   That was government.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.820]   But it was government by coming from my Rand Corporation.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:14.020]   What I see is your attitude, which is this academic attitude of, well, we've got to consider
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.700]   all parties.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.500]   It doesn't feel right to me.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.700]   But maybe I'm coming from a very moralistic point of view where, oh, no, I am too.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.060]   I feel like it's just wrong and there ought to be a law.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.180]   And obviously, you got it, but you got it.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.820]   You got to work off empirical data.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.620]   You've got to show what the harm is.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.300]   You got to define the harm.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.420]   You got to define the impact.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.500]   Then you got to design the interventions.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:47.460]   The problem is we're designing interventions like every kitchen, media literacy training,
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.260]   when it's not the kids who are the problem, it's grandpa.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.260]   I agree with you.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:57.380]   So do you use data to tell them that these two regulations and that you are misguided?
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:05.500]   I think their roots are in many ways misguided based on presumptions and get ready, get ready.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   Get ready.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.700]   I'm queuing you up here.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.580]   In some cases, even moral panic.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.580]   It's stuck.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.580]   The moral panic is stuck.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.580]   Oh, no.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.580]   Do you have a more funny video?
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.580]   Won't move.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.580]   Yes, we do.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.580]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.580]   The moral panic sound.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.580]   Somebody doused the flame.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.580]   There it is.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.580]   Oh, there we go.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.580]   Wow.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.580]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.580]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.580]   Oh, there you've been one up.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.580]   You've been one up.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.580]   You've been one up.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.100]   It's compliments of Mr. Nielsen there.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.900]   Somebody got a tricaster.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.900]   Oh, whoa.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.900]   Ants got it.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.900]   Let's rub that in.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:43.820]   That is a very nice with a picture of Jeff Jarvis floating above the Germans.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.020]   I want that on.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.980]   I want a gift of that.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.980]   Please, please.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.420]   Jeff Jarvis on the McLaughlin group this week.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.420]   I'm feeling about this.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.020]   Wow, you even got your lips moving.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.020]   Awesome.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.020]   Awesome.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.020]   I'm definitely listening to the audio.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.340]   I don't know what to tell you.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   So awesome.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.580]   Can we tweet that or something so people can see it?
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.740]   We got to tweet now.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.740]   That's fantastic.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.340]   That's when you used to be one of the hosts of the McLaughlin group, right?
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.260]   Jeff and you be Jeff Jeff.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.340]   Go rest on your opinion on that.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340]   Well, got it.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.340]   Jarvis wrong.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.340]   Wow.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.340]   Okay.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.340]   Thank you, Anthony Nielsen.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.340]   Wow, that stopped everything.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340]   Good work.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.340]   Good work.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.340]   Good work.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.980]   I, my general feeling and maybe it's a little Pollyanna issue of me is that the
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.540]   EU is attempting to do the right thing.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.340]   This is a work in progress.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.780]   There's no, you know, you're going to have unintended consequences.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.380]   You're going to have misfires, but they're doing something.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:45.020]   Coming from the right spirit, which is we need to rein in these completely unregulated
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:49.260]   companies that are amassing more and more power in our society.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:54.800]   And there needs to be at least at some point somebody saying, well, maybe that's a bridge
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   too far.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.880]   And I think that that's appropriate for government to do.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.480]   It's not going to be perfect.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   It needs to be refined.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.180]   It needs to be improved.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:09.400]   But I feel like these two acts are actually a pretty good step in the right direction personally.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.040]   And it's, and I think they're well founded.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.120]   I think they're well intended.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.240]   We'll see.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.020]   I like Margarita Vistiger.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.880]   I know I'm one of the few.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.660]   He reduced the poses, great UK story was the EU reduced roaming fees years ago across cellular
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.260]   carriers, essentially meaningless.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.260]   It's huge.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.940]   Someone was complaining recently, the EU is re-imposing roaming fees in the UK.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.140]   And it's like, no, you left the EU rules.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.060]   So you will have roaming fees when you go to the EU because you the UK are no longer part
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.060]   of the EU.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.060]   That's a wonderful thing.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.780]   Once you're in the EU, you can have a SIM card from any EU nation and you pay the same
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.780]   amount.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   I think that's garbage.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.780]   The roaming fees were ridiculous.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.780]   Oh, it was ridiculous.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.640]   By the way, impacted every US traveler in the EU as well.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   So I really think that's a perfect example of a regulation.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.640]   It is a good example.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   I've got a positive.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   I've got a positive.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   That's a, you know, yeah.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   Thank you.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   One, one.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:12.600]   I mean, I understand the method of government using government to achieve any of this is
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.240]   fraught with peril is I wish it were time and early.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.680]   I wish that it.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.240]   And I wish it weren't so corrupt.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   I agree.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.780]   But I don't know what else we have, to be honest.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.940]   And I guess for me, it's the only tool.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.940]   We have.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.740]   I mean, people, women now that they know that period trackers are selling their data, they
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:38.120]   don't know specifically which one, but they know that because of good journalism on the
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.340]   part of, I don't know who it was, the verge of pro-publica.
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.380]   But I don't know.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:48.340]   I just fear the idea of an over-correction from our government.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.780]   Like the one to step in to try to make things right for us, these citizens.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.560]   But I think at some point they may go too far in real.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   Of course.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   That's of course a risk.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   That's of course a risk.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.660]   And the founders were very afraid of government and rightly so.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.700]   The other choice though is to let big tech self-regulate.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.680]   And I think we don't even have to guess if that's a risk, right?
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.400]   We know what they're going to do if they're allowed to do whatever they want.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.060]   Or the other thing is they're having regulation in each state too, right?
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.540]   The fact that companies have to comply to California regulations which are quite some
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.020]   of the best in the country now or some of the tightest companies.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.020]   Privacy and retail.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:33.560]   So, but that means that if my state Washington were to pass some very restrictive rules,
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.500]   some companies, maybe our markets are not big enough.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.100]   Maybe they'd exit.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:44.060]   But as with emissions, sorry, emission controls in California, which was allowed to, and
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.100]   they still be allowed to set its own standards, it's a big enough economy that it could have
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.100]   a ripple effect.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.940]   We drove the auto industry.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.940]   And they use doing that too with carbon emissions and so forth.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.740]   So California gets the lead in that regard too.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.580]   And some of the states have been ahead on it.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.020]   But then there's this patchwork, it's the usual argument.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.300]   There's a patchwork of legislation that makes it hard for small businesses and big businesses
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.460]   don't care whether they pay the fees or they ignore it or they comply.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.620]   But sometimes they comply and it changes their policies countrywide or worldwide.
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.980]   There's always unintended consequences.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.900]   That's the nature of law.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:27.860]   I think, Jeff, if I rephrased this argument to say instead of big tech, if I said big oil
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:32.940]   or big tobacco, I don't think we would have, you wouldn't say, well, let market forces
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.420]   determine, I'm not saying market forces should be right.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:40.460]   All I'm saying is what what what doers said in the Rand paper was actually the opposite.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.340]   He said that what regulation does is it tries to forestall unintended consequences.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.620]   What we should do is get to the unintended consequences as quickly as possible.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.780]   He was saying the opposite.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:50.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.900]   So let's everybody let's make cigarettes completely legal.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.900]   Let's eliminate.
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.900]   I'm not a libertarian.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.900]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.900]   I am going to say.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.900]   We don't know.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.180]   We didn't know what cigarettes were for years and years and years and they were legal until
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.940]   we got the science that said, oh, oh, this crap is killing people.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.180]   And then finally we did something about it.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:13.420]   We're making assumptions about the internet being cigarettes, which is wrong and is dangerous
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:18.700]   to the freedoms that it brings to people who were too long, not included in the institutions
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.340]   of society.
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.580]   That's my argument.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:28.500]   It is an effort to control this change in society.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.740]   If you look at two early, we don't know what it's going to be.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.260]   Texas and California and Florida.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.500]   It's trying to say we want to control these these voices we didn't hear before.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.780]   They're very conveniently.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.780]   Now we're hearing them.
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.780]   We don't like them.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.780]   Five years ago, we were going to find a way to control them.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:46.020]   It's Jeff, but these now big tech is so big that it's got to the point now.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.140]   Well, for instance, Glenn asked a great question.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.940]   Why aren't there other search engines?
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.900]   Because the incumbents are so dominant and so big.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.660]   So my response was that's fighting yesterday's battle.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.980]   I think Facebook is going to it is the next my space.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.940]   I think Facebook, which was going to take over the world.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:05.780]   By the way, society, when you made that argument five years ago, Facebook was the answer.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.620]   Oh, no, no, because social search is the next big search.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.620]   That didn't happen.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.020]   I might point that.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.820]   Well, no, it did to the extent of Black Lives Matter and Me Too.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.500]   It wasn't what was planned for by Twitter or Facebook, but people used the platforms
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.940]   because they finally had the mechanism to speak.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.940]   But not as you can.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.940]   You're gone to speech.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.180]   We're talking about search.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:35.140]   So I think by the time we realize how much power Big Tech has in our lives, it will be
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.180]   too late to regulate it.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.740]   I tell you, when Microsoft has this browser everywhere, God knows what power they're going
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.740]   to have.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.740]   It's just going to be we have to.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.460]   I think you can make a strong argument that the DOJ's lawsuit, again, Microsoft in the
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.260]   late '90s did in fact have a very salutatory effect.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.700]   Oh, don't was the EU that killed Microsoft?
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.340]   No, that was the browser ballot.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:04.940]   But it was the DOJ suing Microsoft about bundling and the consent decree that Microsoft
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.460]   agreed to.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:13.540]   And Microsoft backing down on its embrace and Gulf and Devour business strategies that allowed
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.180]   Google to thrive, that allowed the internet to grow.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:21.020]   So I think there's a and you could look at the AT&T break up.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.060]   Which is the market coming.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:27.620]   You can look at the, I mean, there are plenty of good examples of this and of regulation
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.460]   really working and improving things.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:37.740]   And I just worry that we're rapidly approaching a time when Google is so powerful that no regulation
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.740]   can reign in it.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.660]   We may already be there to be honest with you.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.660]   You know what I think?
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.180]   I think that we're going to find that the ad market.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.420]   So Google is already losing ad share.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.700]   It and Facebook are no longer half of the digital ad market.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.740]   Who are they losing it to?
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.740]   Amazon.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.740]   A bigger fish.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.740]   Who else?
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.740]   Well, no.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:58.740]   And then other company.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.740]   I'm forgetting.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.740]   This was on the rundown last week.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.740]   It's in there.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.980]   It's in my things from last week.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:08.300]   So funny you should, if you were just here, Leo, not gallovatting off around the world
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.140]   in places that we couldn't figure out where you were.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.460]   See, I was wondering that because the big battle right now, like, you know, Google and Facebook
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:24.340]   cry about Apple's, was that Google and, sorry, Google and Facebook have been crying
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:29.220]   about Apple's changes to advertising, you know, to how it, the third party tried the
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.220]   other track.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.220]   And all its lockdowns.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:36.260]   And, you know, I'm not going to cry on Facebook's behalf because they can't target me well
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.620]   and I don't use Facebook now, but they can't target people well enough so they can't charge
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.340]   as much to their advertisers.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.460]   And I feel like there's a coming battle is, you know, if we watch market evolution, maybe
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:51.420]   the government is, government, often to your point, Jeff, the government gets involved late
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.620]   and it takes a lot of time.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:56.660]   And they often maybe produce the wrong solution for the point we're at.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.500]   So, you know, there's arguments that Microsoft, the antitrust lawsuit, dragged on so long
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.500]   as reduced enough in scope that by the time it happened, maybe the sheer nature of the
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.100]   suit caused change and caused market.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.780]   Like just the government suing gave the position for competitors.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.300]   I remember how real networks came out of that.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.220]   And you know, not that it thrived necessarily, but they had this huge payout eventually for
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.380]   Microsoft.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:23.340]   They had, they were able to promote this alternate media player, which broke the hegemony of
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.700]   Microsoft's media players.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.660]   And it changed the whole market even before any settlement had happened, even before Microsoft
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:30.660]   agreed.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:35.140]   So, governments often come in late in the process, but initiating action can cause some
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.140]   change.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.340]   And I think right now we have a battle between Apple, which as a marketing stance, I mean,
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.100]   I think it's legitimately technologically implemented.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.620]   But as a marketing stance, it's all in on privacy.
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.700]   And you have Google, not negative on privacy, but it's not their paramount concern.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.940]   Their big revenue is advertising.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:53.940]   They have to balance that.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:58.340]   And you have Facebook, which I don't think really cares much about privacy except as
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.620]   chin music.
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:04.540]   And so they don't, you know, their whole goal is to continue to achieve these massive profits
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.540]   they've had in the past.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:10.500]   And I think that that's going to be the fight is over how these companies use that marketing
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.340]   message and whether they're successful enough.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.900]   And you know, when Google, for instance, implements the version that it intends to do eventually,
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:23.100]   of essentially blocking the same kind of tracking that Apple's already put in place.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:31.180]   I do remember though, saying many, many years ago, watch out when Apple is as big as Microsoft,
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.940]   they'll be just as rapacious.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.980]   And I think that that has proven to be the case.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.860]   Well, it's a different way though.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.620]   It's funny because Apple is so insular.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:45.900]   Microsoft wanted to Microsoft like eight and beat down the landscape around it.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.380]   They would buy all the competition.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.180]   They used to do what Facebook does today, basically.
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.580]   They would go to every neighboring principality and say, you have a really nice place here.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.900]   You want us to raise your castles and so salt into your fields.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.380]   You probably don't want that.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.340]   And Apple doesn't necessarily do that.
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:05.460]   Apple says, Apple says, we've raised our round parts so high, no one shall ever enter, which
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.220]   is a very different model.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.060]   I'm not saying it's necessarily less rapacious.
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.500]   It doesn't seem to it when you're inside the castle.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.700]   And you say, those are really nice tall walls.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:14.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.380]   You don't get to be a two trillion, almost three trillion dollar company without a little
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.380]   rapaciousness.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:26.100]   So do you answer your question, Meta and Google are losing a market share to TikTok, Apple,
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.620]   Walmart and Amazon?
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:29.620]   Not an improvement.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.380]   Walmart, if you ask me, but okay.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.180]   Well, yeah, the other thing that's going on is that advertising changes.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.740]   So we've talked about this in the show in the past.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:43.140]   You're best by selling floors now a marketing entity.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.900]   Instacart is an advertising platform.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.420]   You have to say, I'm a little surprised that Google and Facebook are failing because it
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:56.740]   feels to me they have such a dominant position just because of what they, are they not growing
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.380]   as fast or they actually shrinking?
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.540]   Oh, no, they're losing share.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.540]   They're losing share.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.540]   They're losing share.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.540]   They're losing share.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:09.820]   And the ad market is still going up, but I believe the pie is being advertised.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.900]   So there are more pieces.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:14.820]   But the Facebook and Google are not going to turn around.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.700]   I sat in a dinner before the pandemic.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:23.980]   The last time I sat in a dinner ever with a bunch of advertisers and once the once the
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:31.420]   very good wine was passed out, this was put on by a PR company, they said that do they
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   care about newspapers?
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.180]   They admitted, no, we don't care.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.340]   We build our own relationships now.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.620]   The only thing we care about newspapers for is our stock price.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:38.620]   Rest of it.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.620]   We just don't care about media.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.620]   Right.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.820]   When you say that's going to have more pieces in the pie, are you saying there's just more
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.820]   options?
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.740]   It's just the ad market is growing.
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.460]   It's a much bigger pie.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.260]   The economy is growing, thus the ad market is growing.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.260]   So there's more to share, but they're getting a smaller share.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.940]   So basically, you're saying the pie has been built higher.
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.860]   If I'm going to put it back.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:00.860]   It's a cake.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.860]   It's a cake.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:08.700]   What the turducken equivalent of a cake and pie?
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.700]   Oh, there is.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   You do a baked.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:16.220]   You have a baked Alaska with a cake on the outside, I think, too, right?
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.820]   You can do what they call a frozen Florida.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:22.380]   I think it was a scientific American had this recipe and they use liquid nitrogen to have
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.260]   a hot cake inside an ice cream shell.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.540]   So just do two of those.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.540]   Baked Alaska, frozen Florida.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540]   Oh, good.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.540]   Good.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   This is more off topic anyway, Leo.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.300]   No, no, no, no, stop.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   Just stop, okay.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.300]   Just stop.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:39.500]   33 is a nice little moment from your earlier British discussion.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.300]   I just want to show you the pie cake.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.100]   Oh, you found it.
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.100]   What is the pie?
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.700]   Which is a pie inside a cake.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   Oh, my.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.700]   Because you don't have to choose.
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.500]   Oh, and is bacon this.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.500]   What's that show?
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.500]   I'm making it.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   I'm buying it.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.500]   Look at that.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.500]   Look at that.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.500]   There's three pies inside that one.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   Is that truly?
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.700]   I don't know if that counts.
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.500]   That's like three layers with the fondant.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.500]   It's kind of disgusting.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.900]   The fondant holds it together.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.900]   I don't know.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:08.900]   Or maybe just not even fondant, but.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.900]   Something brown.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.900]   Flest it with some vanilla ice cream.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.900]   It's in cherry pie.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:13.900]   That's like a.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:14.900]   I don't know.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.900]   I don't know.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.900]   You could do a pride cake like that, but I feel like it separates the layer too much.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.900]   Oh, pie cake-in is the answer to me.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.900]   Pie cake-in.
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:24.900]   Dirt-in-the-dye.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.900]   Need.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:26.900]   Frozen Florida first.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.900]   I like whatever.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.900]   I like whatever.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:29.900]   Florida is.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.900]   Liquid nitrogen.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.900]   You make a hot cake and then you use liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream on the outside.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:35.900]   Boom.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:36.900]   Ooh.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.900]   And is the cake still hot inside or no?
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.300]   The cake is hot inside and you ice cream on the outside.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.140]   Oh, so it is very much like a baked Alaska then.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.900]   Yeah, it's inverted with science.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.900]   That's why it was in, I think it's a scientific American, right?
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:56.300]   This is kitchen counterculture, but most food is scientific.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.300]   Food is science.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.300]   As the great Harold, what's his name?
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   Mitchell would tell you.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.820]   All right, I want to take a break and talk about our sponsor because we have a wonderful
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   sponsor.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:10.780]   I know the name of this sponsor, Glenn, because you probably have some of their stuff.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:16.860]   I have stuff from Nomad all over my house.
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:21.020]   They started as a Kickstarter project about 10 years ago.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:26.100]   They were going to build ultra rugged minimalist tools for the 21st century that would seamlessly
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.660]   integrate into your everyday carry.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.980]   In the past nine years, they have expanded.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.420]   They do cases.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.700]   They do Apple Watch straps.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.700]   They do wireless chargers.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.020]   They have some great wireless chargers.
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:43.540]   I'd show you the one that does the watch and the phone, the MagSafe charger, but Lisa
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.220]   stole it.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.260]   It's at home on her bedside table.
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.460]   It's so good.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.140]   They make premium wallets.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:55.300]   They make passport holders and all their stuff is crafted if it's leather with horn
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:59.740]   ween leather, which is the best leather from the horn ween tannery in Chicago, which has
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.100]   been around since 1905.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:09.580]   And anybody who loves leather knows when you say horn ween, that's chef's kiss, an unparalleled
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.700]   blend of quality and consistency.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.700]   What's nice?
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:18.420]   This is a brand new case on my iPhone, but this horn ween leather case will age over time.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.260]   I should show you my old case.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.900]   It develops this nice patina that leather age is so beautifully.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:31.620]   It's unique because now that only you have this particular case, and of course, because
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.940]   it's great horn ween leather, it smells fantastic.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:41.460]   The wireless charging solutions for home, office and bedroom, air pods as well as Apple
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.340]   watch as well as iPhone.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.380]   This is the base one with MagSafe.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.380]   It's great.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   It's so heavy.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.380]   It's right there on the table.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.380]   It's not going anywhere.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.300]   You put the phone on that and it just boom.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   You know it.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.900]   You could, I don't know, I probably can.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:59.780]   Let me say, yeah, you could turn the phone upside down.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:02.340]   The charger upside down, the magnet is so strong.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   That's awesome.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.740]   They now have GAN AC adapters.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:13.020]   We love these gallium nitride technologies that give you very powerful 30 and 65 watt
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.700]   adapters in a very small place.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:21.980]   One of the things I love about Nomad is that, believe it or not, pay attention to the charging
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.980]   cables when you get them.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:29.260]   You'll see the crew at Nomad was just done with crap charging cables that fall apart
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:30.260]   every few months.
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.420]   They decided we're going to engineer the best cables around.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.220]   Double braided Kevlar outer sheath.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:40.260]   Strong metal alloy connector housings.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:43.580]   These have been engineered for extreme durability and everyday use.
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:46.340]   They're also a climate neutral certified brand.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.340]   Let me show you.
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:52.500]   I haven't put on my watch because I want to keep it for the ads, but as soon as the
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.180]   ads are over, I'm going to take the steel band out.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:57:00.460]   This is a beautiful Nomad steel band for your Apple Watch.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.740]   Just gorgeous.
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.460]   Easily, easily remove the links to get it sized exactly right.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:09.340]   It's a bracelet that has a very strong connector.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.140]   It's not going to go anywhere.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.140]   That is gorgeous.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.180]   I'm a Nomad fanatic.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:20.700]   Nomad is and always will be a company that prioritizes design and quality over everything
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.700]   else.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:25.140]   One of the most important aspects of Nomad, when designing new products as they use
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.460]   the highest quality, longest lasting materials available.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:36.420]   I love it when you get something like a case, a charger, a watch band.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.700]   You can feel the quality.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:41.220]   You know it's going to last.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.500]   You know it's made with the best materials.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.940]   It's just the quality is right through it.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.860]   They design all their concepts from the ground up.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.980]   They're not white labeling existing products.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.020]   There's the charger, the base one Max, at least it took.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.020]   I said she could have it.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.220]   She needed a good charger.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.300]   She said, my watch keeps falling off the Apple charger.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.300]   The phone keeps slipping off the Apple charger.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.780]   I said, honey, this is the answer.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.180]   The base one Max charges both.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.420]   It's really a nice connection.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.900]   Ten years they've been doing this, they're having a 10th anniversary sale.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:18.820]   They launched with that simple cable and kick started 10 years ago.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:24.780]   They have grown and they are doing such great work from July 6th, which is today, through

[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.940]   What?

[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.620]   Now that's quality.
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.180]   That's class.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.900]   That's the kind of thing you'd see in a high end mansion, right?
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.460]   30% off site wide.
[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:52.020]   No coupon needed, just simple easy savings to help celebrate 10 years in business for Nomad.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.300]   I love that.

[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.540]   I've been using this stuff for 10 years.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:38.180]   It's just superb, superb quality.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:42.820]   Now that's the market as it should.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:48.500]   The free market giving you great products.
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.820]   Are we at a curiosity?
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.820]   Web3 is going great, right?
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.820]   Web3.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.820]   Just checking.
[00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:57.820]   Yeah, what?
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:58.820]   Not good.
[00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:59.820]   That's not good.
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.860]   Yeah, it's going really, really good.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:06.580]   I like to go to the website just once in a while and see what Molly has to say about
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.580]   the latest.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:12.820]   Oh my God, did you read the New York Times had a fantastic op-ed or what are they calling
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.820]   out an essay?
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.820]   Sorry, it's an essay.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.820]   Excuse me.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.740]   It's the essay section.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:23.740]   And they had a great piece by a crypto, pro-crypto person just going like, "Every currency's had
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.740]   its trouble.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.300]   We've had a tool of panic.
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:31.180]   It was like the things you tell yourself at 3am when you realize your bank account is
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:34.980]   empty and you owe people a lot of money and they're about to knock on the door."
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:35.980]   Well, this is normal.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   They're kind of going up the opposite.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.620]   This is what happens.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.620]   It's just the way it is.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.620]   It happens to see.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.620]   It's every user in those coins he had, you know?
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   That's right.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:48.140]   Look, this is the only thing in history that's had no value attached, that has had no purpose
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.140]   whatsoever.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.340]   And so, it's going to have its ups and downs.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.340]   It's okay.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.340]   Put more money in.
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.340]   So did tulip bulbs.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.420]   Look, tulip bulbs.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.980]   You read Michael or what's his name?
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.940]   There's a book about the history of tulips and potatoes and so forth.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.260]   I'm blanking out the guy who wrote this book.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.540]   He wrote a whole bunch of interesting books.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.540]   It'll come to me.
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:15.140]   The tulip mania, those bulbs were actually worth a lot of money because the broken the
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:21.260]   disease that caused the variegation in tulips produced flowers that were extremely valuable.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.940]   There was actually inherent value.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.940]   I think tulip mania has been overstated for centuries.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.460]   I mean, it was a mania.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.460]   Unlike pictures like that.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:31.420]   There was real value in the tulip bubble.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.420]   People were willing.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:36.740]   So do you remember the difference between like the pets.com crash and like a later crash.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:43.860]   Pet.com was shipping 40 pounds of kitty litter for less than it cost them to ship and less
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.620]   than it cost them to buy it.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:51.060]   Pet.com and some of those early companies, they had no actual revenue to match the outflow.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.980]   It was all venture capital funded.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.780]   So when the next bump hit like 2008, you didn't have the same failure occur among .coms.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.180]   And in fact, they drew strength from it because they had real revenue.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:04.500]   People are like, oh, it's just the same pattern against like, no, it isn't.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.340]   So then I think when we saw the pandemic hit and you saw this incredible surge in value
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:15.180]   in online companies, you know, like Zoom or like Amazon or like Apple, it was based on
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:19.900]   that strength that they were not the vaporware that we're used to in say 2001.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.380]   We've evolved to a time of.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.580]   And ironically, we now get our kitty litter delivered by mail.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.500]   So here's my little roast was right just early.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.500]   He just was too early.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.100]   Mike, think, of course, it's my, you know, my little resistance against Amazon as I ordered
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:39.020]   things that I think cost them were to ship me that it's worth.
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.020]   That's all right.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.020]   They'll make it up in volume.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.020]   It's fine.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.020]   They got a model.
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.020]   They got a model.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.180]   We actually built gross who started that company start, you know, starting to ideal
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.180]   that.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:53.180]   Did a study once of what makes the company what's the factor that's going to make company
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.020]   most successful leadership and so on and so on.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.020]   As it was timing.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.460]   It was, it's actually right.
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.460]   It's absolutely right.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.900]   And if I were to launch Twit today, we would have a.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.500]   Seriously, you'd be bought by Spotify.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.500]   Michael Pollan is the author.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.660]   Michael Pollan, a wonderful author and he's written a lot more about food lately.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.700]   But if you want to understand what Johnny Appleseed, for instance, was really doing
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.220]   not what we were taught in school, you got to read one of his books.
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.620]   You almost said Michael Pollan and I thought, well, I don't know.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.260]   Did he write about the history of Tula bulbs?
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.260]   But I guess he did.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.300]   I think it's one of his books.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.300]   It's really great.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.580]   I love Michael Pollan.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.060]   We quoted him the other day actually.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.060]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.500]   I think yesterday we were talking about it.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:48.420]   So not much to say except that all the crypto exchanges are failing, flailing, going down.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.780]   I've got a question for you, Leo.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.260]   Why if they were, if they were exchanges with a whole bunch of money in their air quotes
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:02.660]   bank, why were they all borrowing money and well, they wanted to make more that's they
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.660]   leverage.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:13.220]   So for instance, uprise, which is a cryptocurrency investment fund lost 99% of its customer funds
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:17.180]   when they tried to short Luna during its collapse in May.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.180]   Whoops.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.860]   Voyager digital file for bankruptcy.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:28.620]   Crypto broker suspended withdrawals a week prior, says his file for bankruptcy due to
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:35.500]   the quote, prolonged volatility and contagion in the crypto markets.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:40.740]   They also had invested in three arrows capital, which was another bankrupt crypto fund that
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:45.060]   defaulted on a loan from Voyager worth $660 million.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.620]   You see the dominoes falling.
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:53.220]   The problem is many of these cases, if you've got custodial wallet with these exchanges,
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.580]   you may be a creditor.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.580]   You may not.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.580]   It's not like a bank.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.540]   Ain't no FDIC here.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.700]   You may be out.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:06.900]   And so it's just dominoes, I think falling coin loan crypto lending platform reduces account
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.100]   withdrawal limit.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:13.020]   That's like, you remember, you know, Jimmy Storty went to the bank and he tried to get
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.020]   his money out.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:18.180]   Your NFT isn't in Leo's house.
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.180]   It's in his house.
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.740]   When I went there, there's no NFT there.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:29.740]   Only can withdraw $500,000 a day down from the half million dollar a day limit.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:37.220]   But they tried to reassure customers rest assured your assets are safe.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:42.740]   Crypto lender vaults, suspends withdrawals, considers restructuring.
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.020]   I can go on and on and on.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:46.820]   That's only this past week.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.740]   It's really scary.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.580]   It's a everybody.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.500]   And then there's the hacking.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   So many NFTs have been hacked.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.300]   You know, I should, I've been getting emails from people about board apes.
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:06.940]   There is a video going around on the, on the YouTube claiming using, by the way, documentary
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:14.380]   techniques pioneered by, by Steve Bannon or maybe by what gabbels before that, I don't
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:19.340]   know, but showing how board ape is actually racist.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:24.180]   And actually as I look at the sketches of board ape, they are kind of racist.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.740]   Oh, and that my 15 year old comes to the day and says board ape.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.060]   This is the conversations we have in my household.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.620]   Board ape is based on Nazi iconography.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.620]   That's right.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620]   And I'm not really, I'm not paraphrasing.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.100]   That's pretty much my 15 year old.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.100]   And I said, Oh, come on.
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.100]   Now I know it's terrible.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.100]   I hate it.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.660]   It's a bunch of scams.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.660]   It's whatever.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:42.660]   And they're like, no, no, I watched the video.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.020]   I'm like, all right, what's the source?
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:48.220]   I have not watched this yet, but they showed me a link from it that shows an almost exact
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:52.500]   trace over of a piece of Nazi iconography that I was unaware of with a skull.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.500]   Here it is.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.500]   And the board.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.500]   And you're like, wow.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   And you're like the Waffen SS.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.860]   This is the, the, the death skull.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.700]   I know the whole thing.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.860]   But you're like, it's, there's some things are, there's coincidence and there's people
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:12.020]   trying to force, you know, square pegs and around holes and then there's things like,
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:16.580]   Oh, if they didn't do that intentionally, then why is it such a perfect match?
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:17.580]   Come on.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.580]   It's a perfect match.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:24.460]   There are the same number of teeth that number resolves to eight off Hitler's birthday.
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:28.980]   Oh, there is a lot of iconography.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.580]   Maybe it's a coincidence.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.940]   I never thought getting on the internet in the 80s or whatever it was called, bit net,
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:35.940]   maybe then, right?
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:38.100]   I never thought it would wind up being so many Nazis.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.100]   I don't know if people are going to beat those.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.900]   You know, I think there's a lot of Nazis anyway, and they just, they're showing up.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.060]   They're commissioned now.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:53.380]   I think we're at the point where anything up to saying what the Nazis said and what the
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.460]   KKK says is now free game.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.420]   And the idea is to be as offensive as possible.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.500]   And right.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.140]   How do you, how do you fight that when that's the goal?
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.140]   You can't use norms.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.340]   You can't say, Oh, shame on you for saying that.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.340]   Ha ha ha.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.340]   Don't you know, live farts.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.740]   Don't you cancel me.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.740]   That's what we are now.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.740]   And we don't have a strategy.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.740]   That was live for it.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.740]   Don't cancel me.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:19.740]   It should be above for sticker.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.740]   Jaffa.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:25.060]   So quotation marks because we're being ironic.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.700]   You know, I don't have a strong opinion one way or the other.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:36.580]   If you watch the video, I, I, it's fairly convincing, but it's also, it's done in such
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.300]   a almost hypnotic over the top propaganda.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.460]   It's a currency way.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:49.300]   That is, you know, I, let's just say talking about it's talking about it being racist.
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.740]   Is that what she's talking about?
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:54.820]   Well, they make, they make the case that it's racist.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:59.380]   You should, you know what, you should probably watch it just sounds like you're skeptical.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.540]   Yeah, I got to watch something.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.540]   I'm of the mind.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:06.700]   I know that racism is this, but I'm also of the mind that, good gosh, if you look for
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.740]   racism, you could find it enough.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.740]   You'll find it.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:10.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.620]   So I'm not always just out there looking for it.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.260]   Well, I'm, yeah, I'm really.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.540]   I'm concerned this black microphone that I'm staring at right now.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:18.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.540]   It's because it's exactly.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.460]   Um, yeah, I don't know.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.900]   I watched the, I watched the video and there's some pretty, it's, it's, there's a lot of
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.980]   coincidences.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:30.980]   Let's put it that way.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.980]   Well, but that's the, that's the, you could find coincidences.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.980]   Exactly.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.980]   I'm, I'm not until I watch it.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:36.980]   Right.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   Is it really worth a look?
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.460]   I watch the, my 50, oh sorry, my 50 year old recommends it.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.860]   So, and they're pretty smart.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:47.820]   So there's savvy, it's interesting raising teenagers who are as savvy as you pretend
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:52.020]   to be, I would say, as I pretend, I pretend to be because we have these wild conversations
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.620]   about like, uh, you know, what's reliable, Jeff, this is sewing your wheelhouse too.
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.380]   It's like, what's reliable information?
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.860]   How do you figure out things that are authoritative?
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:00.860]   They're like, well, I saw it in a video.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.620]   I'm like, well, you know, as well as I do that YouTube is full of unreliable things.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.780]   Like, yes.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:10.100]   So what I did is, and then they describe a methodology of which they feel they cross
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.780]   checked it, but are all the sources using a cross check it good?
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:14.780]   I don't know.
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.340]   So we have very interesting media and credibility conversations, um, because my children are
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.340]   raised.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.300]   yet he's theato where they basically
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.980]   staying at check his sources
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.880]   and only the first thing you see
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.740]   this is the uh... the waffen s_s_
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.100]   uh... totankov deathhead
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.100]   logo
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.600]   it's period it's very similar
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.900]   uh... well that's the yacht club one but still
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.120]   idno i don't know i showed the nazi one first
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.500]   yeah that's a Da Moi
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.300]   yeah that's the old i don't know that's one of the yeah
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.940]   and all of us just say this it's also effing stupid
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.640]   well and well that's the biggest
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.820]   spent forches on this crap
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.460]   yeah jesus yeah
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.220]   uh...
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:05.920]   the hashtag is burn b_a_y_c_ board a bok club
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.020]   uh... and the video which now has one point three million views
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:15.140]   it would be went up about two weeks ago by filion f_p_h_i_l_i_o_n_
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.960]   and i don't know i really don't know he said
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.660]   i'll tell you i think i may mention a bit of a previous episode
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:24.300]   uh... ryan broad rectus this newsletter called uh... garbage day that i highly
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.260]   recommend
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.900]   because for somebody my age in their fifties who pretends to know something
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.980]   i don't really understand what the kids are doing at all or i don't i don't
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.460]   fully understand except not engaged in tick tock
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:37.700]   and influence the culture all that and so to understand the phone what's
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.300]   happening
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.100]   ryan is like a concierge he's like a bridge
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.040]   between us
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.280]   older people and the younger people because he's part of the culture but he
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.320]   stands back
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.720]   and so i always recommend garbage day every day every day one of the
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.240]   only things i read every day
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.960]   because it helps me
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.680]   make some sense that it looks like absolute chaos like it's more than time
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.840]   or
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.240]   the gentle minions like why did minions do so well well of course
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.320]   pete teenagers were
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.440]   and why are they showing up in suits at the so yes yes so i feel like an old
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.640]   man like that off my internet but so i read this news that we have an
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.920]   obligation to know
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.920]   here maybe this is a better uh... side-by-side
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.880]   uh... of those
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.400]   uh... the
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.520]   this is the uh... panzer core uh... from the s s
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.720]   uh... next to it
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.600]   not eighteen teeth
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.120]   very very similar uh... i you know
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.040]   coincidence i guess it could be well are there not sees all around us
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:37.940]   yet
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.400]   yeah i i i i i i just want to the story of
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.160]   there there's some there georgia has the kind of the georgia stone henge it's
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.800]   it's it's it's all that
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800]   we're
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.560]   they got bombed
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.840]   because they're the the religious right things that they're satanic
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.920]   it's our art set of statements on it though is
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.800]   is kind of like you don't have to know what it reads like though it reads like
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.160]   a far-right wing persons idea of what a far left person would put out as
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.320]   the principles so it reads like a parody but it's kind of slightly
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.240]   terrible not like it should be bomb to blow up a graffiti desert as the past
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.760]   it was put up legitimately as i understand it but it's still
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.040]   the statements are like you know from some kind of this is what we're in the
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.240]   side of crap
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.640]   yeah

[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.200]   moment that's the important part
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.640]   what's a two-minute business
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.640]   on the
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.920]   that never mind

[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.600]   old star wars yeah i got a bad feeling about this wow maybe you'd like a person
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.200]   for to play in the movie of yourself right oh yeah absolutely not that not
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.600]   today's tears of four years before twenty years ago
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.840]   he's a little crusty now
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.560]   actually maybe that's why he'd be playing me
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.440]   yeah crash along with you
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.440]   scientific american asked the artificial intelligence g_p_t_ three
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:45.200]   to write an academic paper
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.360]   about itself and then
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.280]   trying to get it published
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.160]   i don't think they were trying to be
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.120]   smart asked about it and do it
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.400]   sneakily they were trying to say
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.200]   let's actually publish this and issues got raised
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.840]   what's the byline who's the other who's the author how do you know how do you
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.440]   uh... attribute things this is the same problem with that
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.520]   microsoft's co-pilot their github co-pilot who's the author of the code
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.720]   you're stealing
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.000]   uh... who is the author of it have an artificial intelligence
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.600]   generated because it because the algorithm is pulling
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.360]   at with co-pilot anyways pulling actual human written
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.600]   code snippets
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.440]   g_p_d_ three is trained on actual
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:32.880]   human right of copyright because because the samplers in hip-hop
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.240]   who used stuff from all around all all g_p_d_ three is is textual hip-hop
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:41.320]   it's a little over it's a little sampling
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.280]   and it's predicted
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.440]   uh... least in the hip-hop world those those guys
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.920]   and gals tend to go and
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.240]   get a license agreement from the people there sampling
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.120]   because they they've all been so many times this sort of stand at first is
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.560]   what you said through the pretty
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:57.920]   well
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.320]   he's a different story and it is different
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.840]   nineteen and it had all learned yep they sampled royal or business that what
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.720]   they did that's it the old pretty well in case the uh...
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.720]   that's amazing
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.280]   all what i was a supreme court
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.240]   uh... it went to the supreme court
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.000]   yeah it was a very key decision is actually uh... really important for
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.760]   remix culture but i think it
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.920]   paved the way
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.400]   is that saying for
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.640]   uh... for licensing open up all opportunities because there was a
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.360]   framework as opposed to being ambiguous so they're campbell
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.640]   a_k_a_ luke skywalker
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.760]   and versus a kaf rose
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.240]   publishing
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:40.080]   justice suitor in nineteen ninety four delivered the opinion of the court
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.440]   uh...
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.240]   both are our campbell christopher one one mark ross and david hobs
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.600]   collectively known as to live crew
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.400]   it sampled
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.280]   pretty woman
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.240]   uh...
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.240]   a kaf roses agent refused permission
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:01.720]   stating i am aware of the success enjoyed by the quote to live crew's crew
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:06.920]   crews but i must inform you we cannot permit the use of a parody
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.000]   of a pretty women
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.080]   uh... to life
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.360]   crew released records set take a compact is a pretty woman
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.000]   in a collection of songs called as clean as they want to be
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.480]   man
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:25.640]   do they were all over the place back then that's funny over the news that album
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.600]   that out there
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.360]   non-clean album and then there is the uh...
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.720]   the parental
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.000]   discretion stickers that will put on it they put it was pretty much them
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:37.760]   uh... that
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.880]   had all that stuff put into place
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.480]   so
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.760]   the adviser is a not this question supreme court found that it was fair use
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.800]   through parity
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.000]   and allowed that's right that's right because i was that right fair use you
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.720]   know this is something i'm sure jeff has volumes to say about this but
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.040]   one of the for the fundamental and why was it anything
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:58.960]   well
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.200]   what the potential spot the fundamental for was the fair use is this a doctrine
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.640]   as opposed to like something that you could just figure out so they've been
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.080]   talks about the copyright uh... the u_s_ uh... patent copyright office or a
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.680]   trimmer uh... also as u_s_
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.960]   copyright office rather setting up an expedited fair use uh...
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.760]   sort of trial court so you be able to go
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.720]   and kind of say here's what i want to do
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.280]   and it would be fair use and there's a lot of restrictions around it but
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.600]   without it you're open to massive copyright liabilities or you your case
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.600]   goes all the way to the supreme court
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.840]   as in that one the the great harvard lawyer larry lecen says uh... that fair
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.760]   use is the right to hire a lawyer
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.120]   that's right
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.120]   uh... if this will date me but you may susan vega had this issue with uh...
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:43.360]   fat boy slim very very early a lot was clear
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.040]   tom's diner remix and uh... i think that she actually in the end settled
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.280]   yeah so i was a little bit because she made a lot of money out of it yeah it's
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.760]   pretty great was great
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.720]   we had uh...
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.560]   susan vega come in and sing the original a cappella version of the screen savers
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.120]   because he was used
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.320]   it has a decade ago it was used by
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.040]   the frown offer corporation
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.280]   for improving the algorithm of mp3 compression
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.960]   with human voice
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.680]   so we had susan in we talked to her and i have a song i said
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.360]   five feet away from her she was singing tom's diner
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.440]   one of the best songs of all time although fat boys slim is remixes is the
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.120]   big hit
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.720]   it's clever as yeah i just he keeps he's probably thirty years later he's still
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.840]   doing his thing to she's still out touring she's still good absolutely
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.880]   still performing she's wonderful but we're again just now
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.440]   uh... scientific american had to ask
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.080]   the computer whether it was okay
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:41.440]   to cite the computer as the author and when the computer and then had to ask
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.600]   the computer said yes
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.200]   then they had to ask the computer whether
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.160]   uh... it had any conflicts of interest because you have to do that
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.920]   uh... it said no
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.840]   uh... and it's all i know there is obviously a joke here is that they're
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.680]   treating as a centi a being after the whole lambda
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.600]   it is but
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.360]   about i'm having i'm having such fun thinking about what you what all you can
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.120]   do with the stuff
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.160]   you actually uh... ask gpt three to write an op-ed
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.800]   i did about your favorite topic
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.800]   uh-huh more and i think
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.600]   dark mode
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.960]   not dark mode
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.160]   more
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.600]   although you might have had more success
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.040]   i'd like to have
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:27.040]   so ishil i read what uh... gpt three three road is it worth reading
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.200]   well i asked to write the three things i asked it right about moral panic
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.480]   then i asked to write a short story with a hero about moral panic
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.920]   and then i asked it to write
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.480]   a a blurb for my book about moral panic
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.920]   so it is all of the thread i would call any of these in ex
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:46.360]   example of sentience
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:51.640]   the internet is often blamed for the ills of society but is it really to blame
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   moral panic over the internet is nothing new
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.360]   in the early days of the internet people were concerned
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:02.240]   that children would be exposed to pornography and violence
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.800]   it never ends that quote by the way
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.000]   that sounds just like mister jarvus

[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.880]   when society began to crumble the internet was there to pick up the pieces
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.280]   it was a safe haven for those who were lost yes it was a place where people
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.120]   could connect with others who are going through the same thing that the internet
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.920]   was on life line for many people that was all the only thing that kept them
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.240]   going
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.720]   however
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.840]   there were some who saw the internet
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.160]   as a threat
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:53.200]   they believed it was destroying society was full of pornography and violence they
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.520]   tried to get the
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.440]   government
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:00.560]   to shut down the internet but they were unsuccessful there was one man oh lord
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.200]   one tall white-haired man
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.440]   who saw the internet as a force for good he was a hero and he fought for the
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:11.520]   rights of the people who use the internet he defended the internet against
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.440]   the claims of moral panic
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.880]   and he showed the world that was a valuable resource thanks to him
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.200]   the internet is still around today
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.280]   and is still helping people to connect

[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.840]   the next word that would work best and work best means it would satisfy us
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.520]   it's all it's doing and and and people are noticing was there using this
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.280]   that it gives back wrong answers all the time because it's not tied facts right
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.520]   it's tied to the flow of corpus
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.280]   of what we've talked about other than that
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.800]   take a little break them to come back and search through time

[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.880]   how imagine
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.200]   a bed that can get hotter or colder
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.680]   depending on the room temperature
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.920]   your sleep stage
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.160]   your preferences
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.920]   it's amazing
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.640]   temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep it turns out
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.920]   the eight sleep
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.040]   pod cover is designed

[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.400]   uh... got in the winter
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.920]   so my least six months ago and at that time i was having a heat up
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.960]   was getting it getting it warmer uh... although
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.400]   it's interesting and i think this is biological
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:21.160]   when you go to bed of course you put out the fire
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.520]   in your log cabin in the house is toasty again that it's called toasty warm
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.360]   but then as the night passes it cools off
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.880]   and it turns out that mirrors exactly
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.240]   your sleep cycles into a deep sleep
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.240]   and then into the remode
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.400]   and then
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.280]   the sleep pod starts to warm up again and bring you in fact i have it said to
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.280]   wake me up
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.920]   not not an alarm but to wake me up by
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.800]   by raising the temperature slowly gradually slightly on the bed
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.120]   so i go naturally wake up
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.600]   in the morning
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.880]   the pot pro cover can go all the way down to fifty five degrees fahrenheit
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.480]   all the way up to a hundred ten degrees fahrenheit or anywhere in between
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.880]   plus

[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.800]   i think it's amazing
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:22.240]   a clinical data shows that eight sleep users experience up to nineteen percent
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.920]   increase in recovery

[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.040]   and thirty four percent more deep sleep and honestly
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.080]   if i could just have one thing it'd be more deep sleep that cleansing sleep

[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.560]   swing sets there
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.280]   there was a little lunch place there it was larry sir gay a handful of other
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.280]   people to tell us about their new thing
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:22.920]   we all got little brio trains that spelled out google and and cut out wood

[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.880]   uh... it was it was just it had just started
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:33.600]   and i i remember uh... larry who was a creator of page rank
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.400]   and cut i think kind of the scientists in this
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.360]   saying something
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.320]   and sir gay explained to me what larry just said
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.600]   that's a lot of that
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.360]   and i said you know uh...
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.960]   for us to improve our algorithm most interesting thing is the and when you get
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.080]   to the end
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.240]   and i said
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.400]   and of what the end of the search yet
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.840]   when you get to the bottom
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.880]   and and larry
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.880]   i i i understand what he said and sir gay explained i still don't understand
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.440]   what he's talking about but anyway
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.080]   sir it tried to explain
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.800]   something about
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.000]   it's the i guess the gist of it is the outliers are what tell you how you're
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:10.920]   doing
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:15.840]   in search not them on the main big results not the top for the outliers
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.320]   okay
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.160]   that's all i remember and i and obviously i'd never learned a thing from that
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.320]   google books uh... two thousand four
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.480]   google local or travel impressed
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.760]   so press they put google books and given the i mean it's great i have no complaints
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.360]   about it but given the
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.800]   years and years of litigation and uh...
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.000]   they still offer those books they've scanned
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.400]   more than forty million alia looks yeah
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.680]   i think i'm not happy trust
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.400]   uh... we have to be able to go to work
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:48.520]   when i'm happy trust in the media we are is so lucky with a golden age
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:51.360]   i think about how people did you know how you have to go to library to get our
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.320]   library loans and photocopy things type stuff up that's where it's i mean
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:59.480]   not be like a nine or nal hasn't and now you have it
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.520]   one of the first two weeks your eggs if you asked
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.480]   in two thousand two what is the answer to life the universe and everything
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.800]   it would pop up a calculator with the answer forty two
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.360]   cool
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.640]   forty two from the great of course douglas adam's
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.120]   oh
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.160]   it's not the galaxy
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:18.680]   tab
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.520]   yeah i lost the tab your you know there's what i was doing what happened where

[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.800]   site maps which is important for a little bit of a disaster yeah
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.520]   oh boy can katrina
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.760]   google's response to that was kind of was a road map for future responses to
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.280]   disasters
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.080]   uh... would tell people find critical information eventually they would put
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   up pages
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.440]   uh...

[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:08.240]   where's the entry for when they uh... tried with a crystal in scenario is that in
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:10.680]   there so
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.200]   did they was it google or was it face book i forget who was trying to uh...
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:19.640]   to get the other to do disinformation about them
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:20.480]   well
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.840]   flood forecasting neural matching
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.000]   we're getting up into the present here
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.920]   if i could just drag it

[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.680]   around and around and around its access
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.320]   so there you go i think that's kind of fun
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.960]   uh... the history of google
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.320]   search
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.400]   twenty five years
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:05.840]   multi search will i guess multi-search go beyond the search box
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.520]   with multi-search
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.960]   we're always dreaming up new ways
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:13.240]   tell you uncover the information
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.680]   you're looking for this is something relatively new they launched in beta
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:18.080]   in april

[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.720]   everything at google killed oh yeah yeah parallel traffic yeah
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.360]   that makes it a little
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.120]   yet killed by google to be fun to have a little time like that's right
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.040]   yet to remember that it's yeah

[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.000]   and only true version of that and marvin
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.720]   is beautifully uh... brought to life
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.600]   there are a handful of people kicking around the math community who worked on
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.760]   the software company that made uh... whoa adults ship titanic i think and uh...
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.040]   some of the games the texan venture games and they have around the mac world
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.720]   like james thompson who
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.080]   dames thompson
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:20.280]   did he work to mix for his work this work folks
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:22.960]   it wasn't so it was a different company in the u_k_
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.040]   oh okay
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.520]   because it was a couple of the hiccup
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.480]   guide to the galaxy's text adventure
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.720]   no the david or Douglas would come into the office and everyone kind of knows
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:36.920]   he's very nice guy so so james thompson in honor his p kalk software which is
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:41.160]   i thought there's a couple t_v_ or yeah he's going on twenty five plus years
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:41.640]   with it
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:44.680]   uh... it has forty two is in the logo always in the logo
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.920]   as it should be
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:51.680]   it's a good permeates macintosh culture as a there is kind of
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.480]   c_c_o_ look at the answer to the
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.600]   it's question in the google school
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:56.560]   it is
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.640]   it is uh... is it we all have our you know earlier today
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.760]   actually this is very german
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.320]   what is tall days in june i think
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.640]   but earlier today we had a little problem in my studio
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:10.280]   there was a dripping
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:12.320]   cut from the happening ceiling
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.920]   i looked up there was a bulge
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.520]   on the tile where there was a massive well of water
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.280]   accumulating
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.520]   i screamed like a woman
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.560]   ice cream
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:30.720]   and the engineering staff came running but you know who really saved the day
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:32.520]   uh... mister jerry wagley
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.160]   who had his towel
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.560]   always knows where is that you know is where is how is in there is this e_d_t_v_
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:38.440]   towel
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.400]   mopping up
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.520]   the water in my office
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.520]   this came up
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:49.600]   it came up just the other day was a little uh... photobomb there is a
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:50.600]   we're trying to put some
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.540]   we're trying to put some planting our front lawn so that we can be a little
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.680]   scheme from the sidewalk just a little bit
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:56.560]   and my
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.920]   my fifteen-year-old says
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.080]   we don't do that you should go down and look at the site like a minute
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.860]   if i can't see them
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:05.240]   they can't see you and of course i think of the
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.600]   bug bladder beast of trawl
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.640]   all yes a creature so fundamentally
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:12.760]   idiotic that it believe that you put your towel over your head
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.280]   c_t_t_c_ it
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:17.120]   it can see you i i didn't accuse them of that but i said
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.480]   i said refraction site lines you've taken physics if you can't see me i can't
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.400]   see you
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.960]   brilliant
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.320]   i want to send and
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:27.840]   the be i have
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.960]   in my drop box and i'm going to share it with you
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.600]   the original uh... b_b_c_
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.520]   hitchhikers guided the galaxy i've read the books i've seen the movie
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:39.960]   but there is really this with this all began with the sattams
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:43.120]   was writing this as a b_b_c_ radio play
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.840]   writing it was a certain order writing it like that down in the minute
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:51.240]   yeah i love deadlines i love the sound of the wishing past my head
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.800]   that
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:59.720]   with the look is there i'm down to three hours nineteen minutes on termination
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:04.040]   shot while it's in me something else to read no no this is not to read this is
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:08.080]   this is something you can let watch over you like those what like those deadlines
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:11.040]   it's really uh... perhaps
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.920]   that
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.160]   the best thing ever recorded let me see if i were i have it in my uh...
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.640]   in my in my data directory
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.440]   i think so it's funny it
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.440]   i know it's special because you know it's specifically in drop box as we were
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.200]   oh yeah
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.440]   as a good it's in it's in my vault
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:31.520]   yeah i actually have a of fond
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:36.920]   pot space my heart for the uh... the version with um... most of and uh...
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.640]   uh... martin smith and uh... who's the other one that i saw and i'm like it's a
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.080]   little i watched this
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:45.560]   it's impenetrable i think if you didn't read the books because it's almost like
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.200]   a
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:50.400]   a quick flip through it it steals from some so i think if you don't know the books
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.240]   i don't think holds together as a movie but as as a right
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:57.840]   as a window into a bill nahi is thought about barf asked oh i love bill nahi so
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.960]   i would i would no wonder for that reason why
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.240]   i've watched some weird stuff but i remember thinking boy this is weird
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:05.200]   it's first
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:09.280]   it's the movie was uh... or in companies that's a movie or a tv show the movie
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.560]   the movie yeah the from like ten years terrible terrible i don't think i i
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.400]   did you loved it
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.080]   but maybe because you already loved
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:24.520]   what gets me is everybody that told me to watch that movie when i came back with
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.560]   my complaints to her like you should have read the book first i said we'll never
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:32.480]   recommend that you don't know i don't think it worked as a movie i think it
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:36.200]   worked as a love letter to readers that's what it really was you yeah yeah
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:40.320]   or i'll send you the original the uh... the audio play because it's actually to
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.520]   me it's one of the greatest
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:44.000]   and the other reason i was aware of it i didn't hear it on the bbc
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.360]   but uh... boston public radio w_g_b_h_
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.280]   played it
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.320]   all the way through every saturday
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.680]   and uh... i think i recorded it i think i have a copy of it because i don't
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.680]   think it's like down generally available for them but maybe it is if you look
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.520]   around
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.320]   i don't think you can buy it or anything
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.800]   uh...
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.600]   let's talk about the flat earth
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:14.040]   what shall we what now great article uh... on the next web t_n_w_
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:18.840]   is actually was in put this in service i bookmark because i i liked it so damn
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:19.640]   much
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:24.160]   it's actually an article published uh... it was in published in the conversation
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:28.800]   uh... and then t_n_w_ republished it so i saw it there i watched hundreds in
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.840]   the flat earth videos to learn how conspiracy theories
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.920]   spread and what it could mean for finding this information i'll give you the
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:36.800]   t_l_d_r_
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:37.280]   thank you
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:42.280]   do not much to learn
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.480]   basically uh...
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.600]   countering disinformation
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.880]   is difficult when people internalize it as a personal belief
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:53.480]   well yeah
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:57.040]   shocking fact checking to be ineffective in backfire
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.280]   because disinformation becomes a personal opinion or
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.160]   more importantly of value
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:05.720]   so you're taking their values
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.160]   uh...
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.840]   i was told facts don't care about your feelings though
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.080]   yeah well
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.880]   apparently feeling that i want to get you feel is on care about your
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.280]   yeah
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:20.240]   that's what that's good if you can identify the rationality behind their
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.720]   specific beliefs
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:27.240]   a counter argument can engage that logic if you can propose a homemade experiment
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:31.120]   but uh... overall beliefs like flatter theory q_n_n_
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:34.680]   and the great replacement theory grow because they appeal to a sense of group
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:38.280]   identity under attack it's precisely
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.240]   people are attacking you for your beliefs
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.480]   that they solidify that you would hear to them
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.160]   because you're on you're on this
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:49.000]   this in group that is being attacked even far-fetched misinformation and
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.400]   conspiracies can seem rational if they fit into existing grievances
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:57.960]   since debates on social media require only posting content
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:01.560]   participants create a feedback loop that solidifies disinformation as points of
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.200]   you
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.600]   that cannot
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.760]   be fact checked
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.000]   so i think the thing you put them in the bottom of well
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.120]   and uh... they can just reproduce the method uh... i'm sure we'll just take
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.800]   people put them in the bottom of well yeah and they can reproduce the method
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:18.000]   that uh... was used in your area here it's often easier somebody rather
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]   here talks to me said sounds right
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.640]   uh... i mean it's a flatter thing is hilarious because nobody is thought the
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:25.000]   earth issues a nobody
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.960]   the primary belief among people who engaged in uh...
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.360]   various kinds of philosophical and scientific work across millennia has
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.680]   been the year is round because easily proven so you can go to all these
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.200]   cultures at their height
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.000]   uh... and some that maintain their height for millennia and they're like a
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.880]   year's round doesn't do us a good but
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:48.120]   we think it might be fourteen thousand miles around that was wrong but you know
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:51.400]   he uh... erotos thing is heard from travelers
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.640]   about a well in egypt with an interesting property at noon
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.520]   on the summer solstice the sun illuminated the entire bottom of the well
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.000]   without casting any shadows indicating that and
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.880]   sun was directly overhead
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.880]   he measured the angle of a shadow cast by a stick at noon on the summer solstice
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.280]   in alexandria
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.600]   found which is some distance away from that well found it made an angle of
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.280]   seven point two degrees
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:19.440]   one fifty of the complete circle did the calculation came up
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:23.480]   with an estimate that the circumference of the round earth
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.600]   i should point out
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.680]   this is in the
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:31.680]   season five hundred b_c_ is circumference you say it was a rounder actually
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.960]   two seventy six b_c_
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:37.280]   uh... he estimate it to be about twenty four
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:41.400]   between twenty four thousand twenty nine thousand miles it is in fact exactly
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:43.520]   twenty four thousand nine hundred miles
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:45.880]   so he pretty much nailed it
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.120]   yeah
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:51.080]   by putting a sink in a well
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:55.160]   so we've got to do it just be a tension during math class there you go
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:59.760]   if you show kids a stick today they won't listen to don't get it
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:03.160]   find me a well i'll show you
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:06.400]   give me a would give me a lever big enough and i'll move the earth here
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.360]   that's right
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.360]   i'm coming here
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:13.360]   i'm fulcrumming here
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:15.200]   i'm coming here
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.440]   when you catch phrase
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:19.560]   that's good i think a bumper sticker would be handy
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:22.400]   i'm fulcrumming fulcrumming here
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:27.520]   uh... meta warns employees of serious times
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.400]   should we be concerned where is the serious music here
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.440]   we are in serious times here and the headwinds
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:36.000]   are fierce
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.040]   internal memo
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:43.040]   uh... warning of a leaner second half twenty twenty two
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.320]   from a chief product officer chris cocks
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:49.560]   i have done a score cocks wrote that we are in serious times here the headwinds
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:50.480]   are fierce
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:52.640]   we need to execute flawlessly
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:55.560]   in the environment of slower growth routine should not expect
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.120]   vast influxes of new engineers and budgets
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:59.160]   wait a minute
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:00.800]   this is exactly the memo
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:02.200]   lisa just wrote
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.600]   uh...
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:05.520]   uh...
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.040]   if you're stealing
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.040]   burs
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.120]   you
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.080]   uh...
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.480]   the biggest review challenge continues to come from privacy changes
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:21.160]   affecting meta's ad business and macroeconomic pressures
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:25.520]   by the way your stock options are girdlin underwater folks
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.880]   monetizing restricted stock units or they do options at meta i don't know
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.320]   what's the question
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:34.400]   i mean that was microsoft secret is they kept people during some bad times
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.080]   because they switched to uh...
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.200]   r_s_ use
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.600]   i got r_s_ use at time in
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.440]   at the worst possible time in the middle of a takeover fight with paramount
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.040]   at warner
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:51.840]   and so it was at the highest of his ever was or ever was going to be
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:55.280]   and i only recently got rid of the last of them
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:55.680]   uh...
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:57.160]   i'm a face book
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.760]   gives you r_s_ use
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:01.280]   they like r_s_ use
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.480]   easier to make money that was easier to to place people to you can say here's a
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.080]   million bucks worth these have become a work at our lousy capo star our company
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.080]   yeah
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:12.880]   and what we're realizing
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:16.240]   face book r_s_ use this is from the product manual
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.080]   product uh... not prok man
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.000]   this is from the uh... employee handbook
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.680]   face book r_s_ use are a valuable benefit for face book employees as long as you
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:28.600]   understand the tax implications of the investment and plan accordingly with your
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:34.760]   tax advisor it can be a benefit greater than traditional stock options offer
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.000]   thank you
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.640]   i'll tell you microsoft you know is a dominant force and amazon in the uh...
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.360]   Seattle area as of the i doctor with my uh... one of my old my kid older kid
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.240]   the other day
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:47.360]   and uh... we're talking about benefits like oh do you have microsoft insurance
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:48.720]   like no i got that
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:49.560]   all
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:53.080]   it's like it's such a cool i have a long insurance here
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.840]   oh get out of here
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:58.840]   if we have individual insurance but it's not bad for pediatric optical but
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.720]   it's you know i have friend who has husband worked for
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:05.200]   microsoft she's like i got my braces for free you know it's a it's incredible
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:06.600]   what they do
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:09.720]   the restricted talking it's in good benefits
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:10.960]   uh...
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:17.120]   among other things uh... face book says we have to come on a ties reels
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.920]   and as quickly as possible is chris cocks again
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.720]   and we talked about this uh... yes i'm fine with that
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:23.720]   reels
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.680]   instagram is just basically turned into uh... tick tock right tick tock
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.640]   tick tock clone if you post a video it's a real
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:32.960]   automatically
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.920]   on its time and seem to do to scowl bit of that
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.280]   well you
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:42.360]   well the thing is uh... i'm fortunate where i'm not just uh... photographer
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:44.440]   that's that she stills also shoot
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:48.080]   video stuff so i'm fine with it but the folks that don't
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.040]   do the video stuff it
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:55.120]   it sucks for the photography community because now their work is being just
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:57.120]   suppressed and pushed down
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.840]   because they're not posting video content
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:02.320]   and i've done the a_b_ tested before
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:04.120]   whether it's on tick tock or
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.200]   instagram particularly instagram
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:10.720]   i see what people are viewing in my analytics and can see where the comments
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.800]   are in
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:16.000]   people will comment on the name is that's posted three four days ago as if it was
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.840]   just posted right now
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:20.920]   but the video content they see that pretty quickly
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.760]   uh...
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.120]   and then so the algo is pushing the video
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.320]   and is a mother things in place to but
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:31.920]   i won't get in all that but it it's
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.000]   i'm fine with this if they want to start monetizing reels
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.440]   sure i'm fine with that i believe i'm eligible for
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:40.880]   for it anyway
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:44.360]   the monetizing would be nice
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.360]   uh... it ain't tick tock yet
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.240]   but i know it's nowhere near the problem is i have tick tock i i want
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.320]   instagram to be instagram i miss
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:56.600]   the old stills of instagram that was a great way to share photos same here
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:00.960]   and the whole algorithmic feed versus the following
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.600]   feed i think that's what they call it
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.200]   that's that's
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.080]   that's fallacy because i click on that to make sure it's only showing me the
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.400]   people i follow and it still will throw in suggests a realist of things that i
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.080]   don't care anything about yeah it drives me nuts
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.800]   so i'm still missing out on a lot of the people that i want to see
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:24.400]   unless i actively search for
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:27.800]   the search is so bad instagram i can never find a role
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.160]   i mean it's
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:31.760]   yet talk about certain things to prove that one
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:34.920]   yeah i have they don't know either them feel like it's important to let people
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.800]   search they want to push you to where it provides them the best revenue
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.600]   is that the strategy of their will figure out what you if you want to find
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:41.960]   a friend
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.040]   you can't
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:46.720]   art arguably that it why would they let you search and what you want because
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.400]   that doesn't produce them the best outcome
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:51.000]   you're the product
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.160]   you know and
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:56.920]   you find more friends you're happier well i don't know from finding people it's
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:00.320]   always like uh... it's keywords are not even keywords in instagram is focused
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:04.280]   on keywords i mean i know you know i know you probably strategies for this
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:08.120]   i have so many friends who post instagram there's like forty keywords in their
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:11.800]   yep description because that's the only way isn't it to get people find you
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:16.520]   sure enough in terms of tags and and and and and and and and and and they put
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:21.960]   hashtags for random products in there too i guess i mean it's crazy what's going
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:26.040]   on but you you were saying mr. LaPort you you
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.640]   it's not it's definitely not a tick tock and i agree with that because
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.640]   that is good there's a good job
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.240]   fairly good job of of suggesting content to you
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:42.000]   um... granite you follow salt underscore hank who has over gazillion followers
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.040]   right now i barely get to see his content you know i actively follow him
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:50.960]   but they try to push up yeah but they do try to push up other things to me that
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:55.080]   would interest me instagram on the other hand they're constantly showing me a
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:59.240]   bunch of teenagers doing it and stuff that i can nothing about or people
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:02.720]   fighting and i'm like i don't want to see any of this stuff
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.320]   do you do you get the one there's the it's a very cool process but i've seen
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.800]   it a lot and you know jeff you'll appreciate this as somebody interested
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.920]   in pre-technology it's the thing where they print ceramics with the use the
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:12.800]   state goes
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:17.000]   group in some incand it goes broop and then it puts a oh i love that it goes
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.800]   but i love that all the time that's beautiful that's in that
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:24.200]   all over the incredible thing the pattern
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:28.560]   is like this flexible gooey like almost um... rubbery looking thing
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:32.040]   and it's got the entire interior pattern of like a dish
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:35.720]   like a plate or a bowl or something so you know like those when you go to a
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:38.200]   chinese restaurant that there's beautifully like fish
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.200]   blue flic fish decorated patterns around a bowl
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.600]   this is what makes it is a thing goes
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:48.000]   the pattern is on the rubber surface it goes whoop onto a pad of ink comes up
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.160]   a bowl goes in it goes
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:51.960]   rule and it fills the entire space perfectly
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:54.160]   and deposits the ink i'm sorry these fits
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:56.040]   sounds too much
[01:59:56.040 --> 02:00:01.440]   i'm no i'm just doing something captured a gif of this
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.440]   but instagram wants to push that out me all the time here's all these bowls are
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:09.480]   made this is actually an argument i dare you to make bloop a show title
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:12.560]   this is an argument for why tiktok is great
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:17.600]   because you said instagram do you mean tiktok or do you see this on instagram
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.480]   me on instagram i don't do the ticket to be a big tiktok uh... meme so must have
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:24.240]   spread over instagram
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:27.440]   but somebody was making this case i think maybe was on twitter on sunday you
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.640]   were here uh... client but
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.280]   that is the tiktok is really
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.440]   opening uh... our eyes to all sorts of things we would never seem for
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:40.800]   including industrial processes i think that's partly because a lot of the
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:45.040]   reasons original tiktok is where chinese showing how they were manufacturing
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.680]   the world's goods but it's it's actually quite fascinating i know my favorites
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.360]   is the underscore captain underscore mark on tiktok
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.920]   ooh he's a maresk container ship captain there you go
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:02.080]   and i'm fascinated by it right but videos of these of these of these
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:05.360]   containers going down ten levels and up
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:10.080]   and and little factoids about how he does his work it's it's it's weird
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:12.400]   it's but i love it
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.760]   well i'm following them right now although as you point out a following them
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:19.600]   doesn't necessarily get you any more of his stuff than
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.440]   but but but they i do get a lot of his because i obviously like it
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.560]   well what do you do that i also do with the hank and i don't get it
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.560]   yeah the real trick is
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.640]   to go every time you see something you want to see more of in the for you
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:34.480]   page which is the random page
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:38.080]   right you just did you will go into it and you look at a few videos from
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.640]   your set and i've noticed you can really
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.200]   uh if you want bikini rich content go in there and look at the bikinis
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.440]   and you will get more so whatever it is you signal i've done that with hank
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:53.040]   and i don't get a hank i get a lot well i don't get hanging a lot of cooking is
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:57.440]   what i get i get a lot of cooking but i i i i i'm specifically looking for
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:00.480]   for hank yeah because i'm curious you have to search
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:03.440]   yeah you just have to search unfortunately
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:07.120]   um which is too bad i know exactly what you're talking about though with the
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:09.680]   bloop bloop thing and i saw that originally
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.720]   on tiktok and it's my guess that it's appearing now
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:16.720]   on your instagram because of tiktok envy frankly
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:21.920]   on instagram yeah i mean yeah i love industrial processes show me more
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.360]   and yeah i agree watching all that stuff is made is fascinating
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.200]   all right we i've been just testing bonito he has for the last hour and a half
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:33.440]   had his finger hovered over the over the changelog button

[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.400]   do you have a pick of the week for us mr. flysman i do
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:22.640]   and it's very appropriate i think given the audience it's uh it's uh
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:28.160]   it's a book by a graphic design production person who works in movies
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.240]   which is a very specialized thing i saw some images from it and got a copy
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:37.440]   it's called fake love letters forced uh forge telegrams and prison escape
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:40.320]   maps designing graphic props for filmmaking
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:45.200]   and it's just got wonderful details in it and i mean i love this stuff i eat it
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.400]   up but it's just um it's a lovingly loving little book
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:52.080]   it's not a big book but it's just kind of about the process of making
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:57.200]   films look like they're lived in you know and looking and and even the degree of
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:00.960]   research they go where they are like oh that didn't exist in 1922 we can't put
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:03.200]   that in but um this is one of my favorite things it's
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:06.400]   like that she did some research and found the sign on the left it's a
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:10.960]   legitimate sign that says steamed eels and mashed potatoes oh god
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:15.280]   always yummy let's common dish this is from uh
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:19.120]   1900 common dish of the time eels were very popular eat in england
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:22.880]   and then her version for a film where they're trying to recreate that
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:26.080]   that feeling um but she said you know this is the thing is
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:30.320]   the the eels part in mashed potatoes not surprising the always
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:33.840]   ready parts the thing she said i couldn't guess that without
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:36.640]   doing the repair the embers and wait let hold on there compare the embers
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:40.480]   ends yeah oh here's a bunch of the sheets
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.240]   she will let's do hold up the modern version of the modern ampersand is so
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:49.040]   different well that's what i'm saying yeah no no look now look at hers
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:52.880]   no it's just the same okay it's a little bit cleaner right it's uh
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:56.800]   i think this was for uh i love amber sands in uh
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:01.440]   penny dreadful they were but it's just it's just fun to see how um
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:04.240]   it's a great mix of i'll tell you this other thing it's very tactile i
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:07.440]   can't do this on a podcast or videocast but there's actually a
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.640]   special kind of varnish so the cover is smooth and the series says the
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:14.320]   matchbook has a little texture on it oh i know so it's not just
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.200]   shiny which most varnishes it's actually got a little bit of
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.600]   rough feel to it so anyway i just found this a delightful thing to read
[02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:24.720]   because it's about you know creating new things and just the
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:27.360]   the complexities of movie prop making without
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:30.640]   going super inside baseball like they had to make you know if you want to put
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.120]   one telegram blood stain telegram into a movie as appears in uh i think it's
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.320]   the grand Budapest hotel you have to make like uh
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:43.120]   forty seven of them that look nearly identical because what happens when they
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:45.040]   have to shoot that scene again and again you can't
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:48.240]   not have these props available here we go
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:53.120]   that's the spread look at that so they're all slightly different but close enough
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:55.760]   because so they have to design it yeah and then
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.440]   and make these multiples so anyway it's just a it's a fun read it's a short
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:02.720]   book and it's just beautiful and beautifully designed and
[02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:06.880]   that made me happy any Atkins fake love letters forged telegrams and prison
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:11.440]   escape mats maps designing graphic props for filmmaking
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:14.960]   available in paperback from Amazon there's an analogous
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:21.120]   uh craft called playback that maybe is more timely which is those computer
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:24.560]   screens you see in movies and tv shows there is a person i've talked to them
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:27.360]   because they use stuff from our show sometimes
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.040]   that does that that makes those screens and they make that's great it's a that's
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:34.160]   a that would be a great book i'd love to wear a video or something i'd love to
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:37.840]   see more about that it also reminds me of when we went to
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.600]   see Hamilton in New York you know everyone's while on Broadway they do
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:45.760]   these benefits for Broadway cares where they they're auctioning off
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:50.720]   things and i kick myself because i didn't stick around and buy this but they
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:54.560]   were selling there's a moment in Hamilton where
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:00.560]   uh uh i think is it his wife burns his love letters
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.400]   yes yeah yeah there are they throw the love letters in and they burn them
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:09.840]   they were selling those love letters from the set
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.880]   oh dude same thing somebody had to make them every
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:15.040]   every show somebody had to make your love letters
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:19.040]   thousands of those they were selling them and i you know along with autograph
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:22.160]   posters a bunch of other things and i i gave the money for Broadway cares i
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:24.640]   always do but i wish i had stuck around there's quite a
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:27.760]   press in the lobby i wish i'd stuck around to buy those because that would
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:31.120]   have been in hindsight that would have been something to

[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:44.640]   yeah i've not been in arby's for 30 years maybe longer oh bless your heart
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.960]   am i missing am i missing out i i go a couple times yeah i just like
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.880]   plain old roast beef sandwich but is it really roast beef it's so pink i feel
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:57.760]   like it might be made out of it's a real rubber kangaroo
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:03.600]   it feels like it's formed it's not like roast beef so so i used to work upon
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:08.640]   roast steak house yeah and all of our beef came from low grade
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:14.720]   australian beef oh and if you if you took a raw
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:20.640]   uh defrosted steak and you bet it back you saw needle marks every
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:25.040]   quarter of a tenderized tenderized right right
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:28.640]   so yes it may be beef leo but who knows where it comes from
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:32.720]   low quality australian beef it tastes fine
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:35.440]   it tastes all right i'll take your word for it because you were not wrong about
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:38.320]   the popeyes chicken meat a popeyes chicken
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.160]   i i i was right now i didn't know when my son lived in

[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:54.800]   pizza and roast beef it makes no sense pizza and roast beef roger irish i

[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:18.080]   it there also had some duncan now it is time for ant pruit
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:22.800]   and his pick of the week all right mind will be quick first one i just want to
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:26.080]   do a bit of a public service announcement i know a lot of folks have been wanting
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.400]   to get into being more healthy getting out exercising even
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:34.560]   buying a bike if you can get your hands on one particularly e-bikes
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:38.720]   well walmart has come to the rescue to give us an e-bike
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:41.760]   and i want to tell you don't buy that bike oh thank you
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:46.240]   whoa it's fifteen hundred bucks you're saving me some money
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:50.640]   do not buy that bike it's a e-bike mountain bike and
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:54.400]   i've had uh mountain bikes in the past so i used to ride
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:58.400]   quite a bit but now doctors orders tell me not to ride oh that's sad
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:02.400]   oh i love to ride well because it because it's crashing so and i don't want to
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:06.800]   destroy my replaced hip yeah that's a good point oh and i've had inexpensive
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:11.360]   bikes before i've had bikes from walmart and other inexpensive bikes they do not
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:15.280]   last so do not spend fifteen hundred dollars on this e-bike
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:18.800]   as much as they're trying to sell it get something else get you a
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.600]   non-e-bike for a lot less you did a review uh on an e-bike for us
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:26.800]   and i'm determined with this i did van move the van move these are like
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:31.360]   considered kind of the top line of touch they're quite nice yeah
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:35.840]   yeah those things quite expensive but you like the van move you get what you
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:38.560]   pay for that's the thing you get what you pay for
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:41.680]   yeah that's it nevan there are some real breakthroughs in
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:45.920]   e-bike i'm a huge e-bike fan i just i love electric bikes
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:50.000]   um but uh one other left is what i demo yeah the steps are left
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.680]   oh you you add them on how much how much they're like
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:58.160]   it's like 3200 i think that's not bad no actually it's not bad
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:01.280]   i mean uh we have a specialized for our kid it was
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:05.520]   seven thousand dollars this is three thousand near the s5
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:08.800]   yeah that is actually not bad and look how elegant it is
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:11.680]   you know it's big ugly battery on the thing
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.360]   i mean looking at i believe mr. Nielsen coined the detestla
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:18.800]   of bikes well don't solve so it's pretty
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:22.560]   no it was just really pretty beautiful lines you didn't see any of the cable
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:25.840]   in and that it yeah there's there's a
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:28.080]   a review out there on our website somewhere
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:33.280]   yeah i'm looking at rad bikes because i have i have three red power bikes
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:35.920]   that's great there you have i i think they're eight headquartered in seattle so i
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:39.680]   can go and test them out here i love ours i seem to have some good entry
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:42.560]   level models for a non-mountain bike version i'm very curious
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:47.360]   we have uh we have uh lisa has the fat tire
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:51.760]   one i have the city step through uh they're excellent they're
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:56.320]   they're lower costs so you're gonna some of the components won't be the
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:00.080]   best like the brake pads you have to replace the brake pads every once in a
[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:04.240]   while things like that but uh they're i really like our red power
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:07.680]   really great bikes yeah i could wait and the
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:12.000]   electric does reviews of electric bikes which i i trust and i think they're quite
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000]   good they're an electric car magazine as well and they have some
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.760]   uh good recommendations but i love my rad power i'm very very happy so how
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:24.240]   much does that run blue uh they're more like 1500 bucks they're not bad
[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:28.240]   yeah i can go uh test drive here in seattle and i could rent it for a day i
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:30.640]   think do you want to off-road or you want a city
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:34.640]   city bike i'm just a city person i've got i got knees and other issues so i can't
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:37.360]   do the hills i'm too i'm too old for the hills with my
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:41.280]   current set of health uh and recommendations so seattle
[02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:44.480]   known for hills as you'll see next week i believe i will
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:49.360]   this is what i have the rad city mountain bike steps through rough these are great
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:52.960]   get a step through it's not a girls bike it's just an
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:58.640]   easy to get on bike uh as old guys yeah and i really i really i haven't seen
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:02.480]   these other ones and then i got a basket for mine so i can go to the grocery
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:04.480]   store get a big old basket on that thing it's
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:08.320]   grove tono tono in the basket away from him
[02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:10.800]   da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:16.560]   but lisa has the uh the big fat tire off-road the rad rover and she loves
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:20.000]   that bike that's a great looking bike but again we've had to replace the
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.080]   brake pads uh after a year of use and and stuff like that there's just little
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:27.200]   maintenance things you have maintenance but they work great so so how does it
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:31.200]   work you can you can just run the power and not
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:35.760]   pedal at all on a big hill yeah yeah as pedal assists mostly
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:39.360]   well so there's two ways you can do an e-bike you can do pedal assist which
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:44.480]   means you have to pedal or won't go anywhere the specializes like that
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:47.760]   most of the bikes i get including all the rad powers have throttles
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:51.280]   so you can just push the throttle and go forward
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:54.000]   a steep hill you're gonna have to pedal you're gonna have to help it it doesn't
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.920]   have so much yeah that's what i'm right it can get you
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:59.600]   that's what it's worth but we had the city full of e-bikes here you know Seattle is
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.480]   one of the places where like i know five or seven companies deployed all those
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:05.760]   bikes at once and then they moved into e-bikes so i was able to test some of
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:09.120]   those and i thought wow this is a whole different thing than i don't know 15
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.440]   years ago and i saw people buying e-bikes and before
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:14.720]   lifting iron batteries were reliable and all that and i
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:18.320]   got to cut again to this i want to get out more and less driving
[02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:21.760]   if you are gonna if you have your kids are a little older now
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:25.760]   five little kids they have uh rad power bikes for kids
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:28.480]   that i mean that you put the kids on the back
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:31.840]   they have cargo bikes this rad ragged wagon you could
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:36.800]   you could pull cargo behind you uh this is for a kid to sit on the back
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:40.160]   uh i'm in front of the Netherlands who she had four children
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:43.440]   and you know the Netherlands is very flat oh they love their bike friendly
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:47.040]   to the the bok feet you know the cargo bike and she would take i've saw pictures
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:50.320]   of her where there are four small children driving them all around the big
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:53.200]   cargo thing yeah and i was like how fast can you go and she's like well you know
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:56.400]   like five miles an hour but that's all we need everything's close together it's
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:59.600]   all flying i see you i see families on their red
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:03.520]   powers all over town oh that's really cute they're really yeah it's really
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:08.160]   cute i love it i'm a big fan i just wish it were safe
[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:12.320]   because it really isn't safe to bicycle anywhere around here yeah i've got i
[02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:16.960]   live on country roads uh to lane roads out here and yellow you know yellow line
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:19.440]   roads and
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:23.520]   uh hard to use scooters hard-hitting oh yeah
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:28.080]   scooters they wanted a bike which you like what you had because they saw on
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:31.040]   at your house but they ended up getting scooters and they love those
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:35.040]   those are great perfect for portable too i know right yeah and they can
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:38.400]   really just michael used to wear and lock them up michael used to take the
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:42.560]   smart train uh the light rail to close to school and then he'd bring a scooter
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:45.040]   and he'd get on the scooter and go the extra mile to school
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:47.760]   he did that and all through high school it was really great
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:51.760]   did you want to plug these uh this battery quick charger too
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:56.160]   yeah yeah this is a funny story because i bought
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:01.040]   i was talking to mr. Nielsen earlier i needed to get a new v mount battery to put
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:04.080]   on my video camera that i'm talking to right now
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:08.480]   because i'm starting to do some more video work and the reason i got away from
[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:10.880]   v mount batteries because they were too big and bulky so
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:15.600]   i was using what we call what's called these npf batteries
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:20.320]   so they're smaller lighter um just don't have a ton of power
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:24.160]   but when you go to charge them up this battery right here it takes about
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:28.320]   12 hours to give a price of real battery 12
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:32.400]   daggum hours and i have a have one that's smaller than that and it still takes
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.960]   it about eight hours to charge uh well this here is from zg
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:42.800]   sini it's an npf battery charger that's a quick charger it uses usb c
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.360]   pd um so if you get something like what we talked about earlier with no
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.360]   bad sponsor and you know having a gan charger plug it up to that
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:57.040]   it will cut that time in half if not more i charge this npf
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:01.760]   um i think this one was about two and a half hours of charge up full
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:05.280]   wow and there's only 30 bucks for that so i was like yeah
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:08.800]   i get those and it came with these nice pretty
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:13.360]   cables so because you know i love orange so v mount means the battery is mounted
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:17.440]   kind of on top of the camera not inside the camera
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:20.240]   so this is it yeah this is a v mount battery right here
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:24.960]   it's called a v mount because it locks into a plate this shaped like a v
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:28.080]   so what do you do with the battery you don't use the internal battery at all
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:32.720]   on the camera correct because cinema cinema batteries on the internal
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:34.960]   side are so weak yeah they don't last very long
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:39.200]   yeah no so you put that on top and how do you tell the camera
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:44.000]   that's getting used from that battery you can use a d-tap connect in
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.840]   connection or it depends on your your camera you can use so they're designed
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:50.800]   or they're designed to do this they understand that you're
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:56.000]   doing it somewhere else cool all right very good

[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:51.760]   Kodak we had this place up in main called the Kodak Center for creative
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:55.440]   imaging and we had the some of the most advanced equipment under one roof
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:30:00.160]   and so photographer Greg gree heisler fantastic award winning photographer
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:03.360]   uh had come come up and taught some classes and done some stuff and he said
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:06.800]   hey can i come up and do the secret project and we said sure
[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:10.640]   my boss said sure and uh he came up and we uh
[02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:14.000]   it's one of my good friends who's one of the people i managed there
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:17.040]   she worked with him for a couple weeks straight and i he kept asking for more
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:19.680]   hard drive so i'd come in and help and consult on
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:23.680]   we're using electro set color studio to produce this this was a
[02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:28.880]   photoshop and electro set color studio we were you we're scanning film we
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:34.320]   had to keep pulling up 500 megabyte drives and changing them together
[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:37.840]   it was an incredible effort we exceeded the capacity of
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:41.520]   technology at the time to produce it but it was running late and so instead of
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:44.480]   calling Greg who was the high-paid wonderful photographer really
[02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:48.640]   lovely guy the art director called me got my number from someplace
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:52.320]   and yelled at me and i said look i'm i'm just i'm just plugging hard drives
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:55.840]   in i'm just plugging hard drives not important
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:58.880]   he said the art director said what's a hard drive is it because you had all this
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:02.240]   compositing to do with all these other images oh my god there's so much
[02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:06.000]   compositing it was uh yeah we were scanning all these slides from
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.840]   frames all those images in the cover you see there so the time in a year
[02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:14.800]   they were all individual frames taken from cnn and Greg had shot
[02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:17.760]   Ted Turner the next year Greg got in trouble because he shot
[02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:21.600]   the two faces of George Bush that's George hw bush
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:26.480]   and he did it in camera so he had a large format two and a half inch camera i think
[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:30.640]   it is right two inch short the film camera and he shot
[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:34.320]   bush is two profiles simultaneously in camera
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:37.600]   and got temporarily banned from the white house and the white house press
[02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:41.200]   core had to go and stand up for him because they said editorial opinions
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.600]   or not something you banned people for in this country
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:49.280]   strangely yeah that's kind of wild yeah back in the days we used to hang
[02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:54.960]   around with photographers yeah like a pretty museum hey
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:58.960]   hey there have you been in the pretty museum and have real mass
[02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:02.640]   top of my list i haven't been there you haven't been still yet oh
[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:05.680]   folks folks folks it's been a pandemic Jeff you haven't heard about it but
[02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:10.240]   there's been a pandemic yeah all right all right so so why did the two faces
[02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:14.160]   cover get him in trouble well he did it for real
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:18.160]   yeah he did it there he did it so in camera he literally
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:21.120]   took he composed this is how brilliant if it tired he brilliant
