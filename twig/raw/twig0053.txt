[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.400]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google, covering
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.240]   the cloud, the Googleverse, and anything else
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.520]   we damn well want to talk about.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.240]   Joining us right now, Mr. Kevin Purdy, who's filling in
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.600]   for Gina Trapani.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   I guess you could say that.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.920]   Gina's on vacation.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.640]   Kevin is at lifehacker.com.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.280]   And is the Android expert.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.440]   In fact, your book is it out yet, or is it coming out soon?
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.800]   No, boy, never out.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.880]   It is coming soon.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.760]   I would say the wiki will be out in about 30 days-ish.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.480]   And I will have something to talk about later on the show,
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   though.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.360]   Good.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.240]   Yeah, a little special offer for those of you who listen.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.520]   It will be just like Gina's complete guide to Google Wave.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.480]   It'll be the complete guide to Google Android, basically.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.960]   Yes.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.640]   Same publisher, same type of model,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.600]   and hopefully the same kind of community interaction, too.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   I'm excited about it.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.320]   I'm a big Android.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.680]   As people who listen to the show know, I'm a big Android fan.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.640]   I've gone to the Droid X, and I just love it.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.960]   What are you using right now, Nexus 1?
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.600]   The Nexus, yes.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.160]   Mostly because to write the book, I
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   want to make sure I had Android 2.2 as soon as it came out.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.280]   So the Nexus.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.520]   Which is a very nice phone, too.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.600]   Oh, love the Nexus 1.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.240]   And you have the pure Google experience.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.560]   Some news about the Nexus 1 we'll get to in just a little bit.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.120]   Also, here from his vacation in the Poconos, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.720]   You cannot be in the Poconos.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.320]   Don't share a pain-shaped hub for me.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.640]   We are in the Poconos.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.520]   I want to give a plug.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.440]   I'm at Skytop Lodge in the Poconos,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   which is an island of civility in the otherwise trailer
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.040]   park bit of Pennsylvania here.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.960]   4,000 acres, beautiful space.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.440]   We've been coming here for 16 years.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.880]   Kids absolutely love it.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.120]   Bakes and pools and animals and all kinds of great stuff.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.960]   So Skytop Lodge, Twitter is Skytop Lodge.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.640]   And this is kind of a special last trip with Jake, I guess,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.840]   because he's off to college in the fall.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.760]   Exactly.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.560]   I don't want to make you cry.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.160]   Last full family together.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.960]   Yeah, you too, Leo, huh?
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.320]   Me too.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.240]   We're flying to Manhattan next week
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.800]   and driving up the Hudson River Valley
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.280]   to drop off Abbey in New York State as well.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.000]   So--
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.920]   That's early.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.280]   They start three weeks early for the freshmen there.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.480]   They have a special course in literature and writing,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.800]   which I think is a really good idea.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.000]   Glad to get Jay Rosen back on the show as well.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.920]   Jay, it's nice to have you.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.640]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.160]   Thanks for asking me on.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.080]   Jay is Professor of Journalism at NYU and his blog,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.120]   pressthink.org?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.800]   Yes, it is.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.360]   Not org is a great place to go to find out
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.960]   about the new journalism.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.920]   And he's a--
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.160]   he's like Jeff, crafting new journalists as we speak.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.040]   He's modeling the clay.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.600]   Frankenstein lessons.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.640]   Jeff, what is that room you were in there?
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.440]   It looks like a conference room or something
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.920]   at a holiday.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.440]   Yeah, they're giving you a conference room here.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.080]   No, no, no, no, it's much nicer than that.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.720]   It's a conference room with a direct connection.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.880]   So the same departments across the hall.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   Good.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.720]   I should have mountains behind me and you're running by and lakes
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.680]   and things, but I don't.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.880]   We'll put that in with green screen later.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.400]   You look like you're at a Marriott at the here.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.480]   I wasn't going to say anything, Jay, but--
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.560]   It's true.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.480]   You should have probably in a room with a window, yes.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.000]   You'd see the Sylvan surroundings.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.240]   I'm just jealous, that's all.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.200]   So one of the reasons I wanted to get Jay on this week
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.840]   is really not having much to do with Google,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   but it's certainly part of our purview to cover the internet.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.080]   And because of Jeff, we talk a lot about journalism
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.880]   and how it's being impacted by the internet.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.760]   And we have talked about WikiLeaks before on the show.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.560]   WikiLeaks is very big in the news right now
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.880]   and a little bit controversial in the news right now.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.120]   Jeff, do you want to summarize what's going on?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.040]   I mean, Jay, I'm sorry.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.440]   Sure. Well, Sunday afternoon, the New York Times,
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.760]   the Guardian in the UK, and Der Spiegel in Germany
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.160]   went live with their respective reports
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:38.360]   on a trove of documents that WikiLeaks had received
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.600]   that are intelligence reports about the Afghanistan War.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.400]   And it emerged very quickly that these three news organizations
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.080]   had been provided with access to the documents
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.680]   about a month earlier.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   They had all worked together and separately on their coverage
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.080]   and the stories they wrote about them.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.920]   And then shortly after the stories went live on the internet,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.760]   WikiLeaks released full text documents themselves on their site.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.160]   75,000.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.440]   Yes. And also announced that they had about 15,000 more
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.200]   that they haven't released yet, that they are editing
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.960]   for reasons of safety, meaning they don't want to do harm
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.520]   to possible intelligence sources and other people who
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.680]   might come into danger as a result of what they're doing.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.040]   So you had, first of all, this story of here's
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.600]   what the documents say about the war in Afghanistan.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.080]   You had the collaboration among the three news organizations.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.440]   And then you had this massive leak
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.480]   that WikiLeaks had received a while ago, resulting
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.880]   in publication of tens of thousands of intelligence
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.360]   reports marked not top secret, but secret, which
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.720]   is the second highest classification
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.000]   in the United States intelligence services.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.640]   And since then, there has been reaction on several fronts.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.680]   There's been, first of all, what the documents say
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.040]   about the war and how difficult it is to win.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.080]   There has been this discovery by many people
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.760]   who didn't know much about it of WikiLeaks,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.600]   as what I call a world's first stateless news organization
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   in which we can get into more later.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.840]   And then, of course, there's the story
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.080]   of new media and old media collaborating,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.680]   or at least cooperating, in the release of the story, which
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.640]   is also fascinating to people like Jeff and myself.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.520]   And then there's the usual controversy
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.080]   over whether the leak harms national security
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.600]   and the done creations from the White House
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.800]   in the name of national security, which we've pretty much
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.600]   come to expect whenever something like this happens.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.000]   So that's what's been going on.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.240]   And the buzz really hasn't stopped since Sunday afternoon.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.040]   Is this the Pentagon Papers for the 21st century?
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.160]   Well, it's kind of annoying because people
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.880]   ask that and judge this event very commonly
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.720]   in the coin of the Pentagon Papers.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.520]   And I don't think it's that.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   And I don't think it will have the same power
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.160]   for a variety of different reasons.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.600]   The most important difference is that the Pentagon Papers
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.720]   were already a synthesized narrative or story
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.960]   of the United States involvement in Vietnam.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.880]   They were not raw data, as these documents are,
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.920]   but a kind of secret history of the war
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.360]   that had been written by the government and by the military.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:19.280]   And they don't have the same power for a number
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.040]   of different reasons.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.280]   So they're not the Pentagon Papers.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.520]   But what happens is that because they're not
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.040]   the Pentagon Papers, that becomes an excuse
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.600]   for dismissing them.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.640]   Another thing that happened that I didn't mention, Leo,
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.560]   is that those journalists and news organizations that
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.800]   weren't in on this arrangement tended to say
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.040]   there's nothing new here.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.640]   We knew this already.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.880]   I don't know what all the fuss is about.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.080]   This isn't the Pentagon Papers or as Thomas Ricks, former
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.120]   and military reporter from the Washington Post said,
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.400]   I've learned more interesting things over dinner
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.480]   with a source.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.960]   So you think that's a little bit of sour?
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.000]   Twitter asks, why did you reveal that?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.160]   Yeah, it's sour great.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.680]   That's what you're saying, Jay.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.320]   Well, there's certainly an element of that.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.360]   The White House also said there's nothing new here.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.000]   In the same breath that they said,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.600]   this is a huge violation of national security.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.000]   Right, exactly.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.600]   As you pointed out.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.400]   Which was pointed out in my post and Julian Assange,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.280]   who is the founder and key personality in WikiLeaks,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.680]   had the same thing in several media appearances that he made.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.240]   So this show is not about--
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.440]   we're not going to cover the story in the sense of,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.640]   here's what the WikiLeaks papers reveal,
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   national security issues.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.120]   We do have a little bit of a connection to it.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.920]   Adrian Lamo, the hacker who turned in specialist manning
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.480]   for some of the leaks, is an old friend of mine and of the show.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.400]   Oh, yeah?
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.040]   Yeah, kind of a surprise because he considers himself,
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.640]   I think, a White hacker did serve House arrest
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.480]   because he broke into the New York Times databases.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.880]   But he says he did it to reveal the security problems
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.720]   for the Times.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   And as a hacker, and he says a journalist,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.960]   he spent times in the chat rooms talking to different hackers.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.480]   And it says that specialist manning
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.720]   confessed to him and he felt like because of the security
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.960]   implications, he had to go to the Pentagon
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.720]   and turn the guy in.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.880]   I know the hacking community is a little bit torn asunder
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.440]   by all of that.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.000]   But even that isn't really our beat.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.760]   I think our beat is really how this changes journalism.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.120]   Jeff, do you have something you want to add to this
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.000]   before we get into the weeds?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.680]   Because there's a few things here.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.200]   One is the idea of transparency.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.440]   And the only sure fix to leaks is transparency.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.880]   And I think that we're going to see
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.560]   whether through practical means or whether through
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.640]   some version like this, more and more and more
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.560]   need to be transparent.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.520]   That's what Assange says.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.360]   WikiLeaks is all about is transparency.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.560]   That's his point.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.680]   And Daniel Ellsberg did say that he was waiting 40 years
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.600]   for this to happen.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.800]   And if you look at a very tactical level,
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.400]   the difference is he had to stand on a Xerox machine
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.840]   for hours and hours.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.160]   Now there's more data stored in a more accessible way
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.280]   that more people can get to that can be distributed more easily.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.320]   And that's going to have an impact.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   That's the cloud.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.840]   There's other clouds out there.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.680]   And what is the cloud?
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.760]   What does the world know?
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.640]   And what does the government know?
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.480]   And what's secret?
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.280]   And what's not?
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.880]   And that's why, by the way, I feel
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.800]   that this is an important for us thing for us
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.680]   to discuss on this show.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.040]   That's the particular area that I think is important for us.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.880]   Yes, I think so, exactly.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.280]   Yeah, I think also.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.880]   That's exactly the J focus talk.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.320]   Now, I should explain for people listening
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.520]   that Jeff has a bit of a lag.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.560]   And so there's going to be this little conflict where
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.040]   Jeff doesn't hear us talking.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.920]   And he's talking.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.800]   He's not being rude.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.360]   And nor are we being rude to him.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.480]   There's just a little lag involved.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.680]   So I'm going to let you go ahead, Jeff.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.200]   And then we'll--
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.880]   I'll get Kevin and Jay back into the discussion.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.160]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.640]   I'll be more sensitive to that, too.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.080]   It's wacky.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.960]   One thing that Jay concentrated on in his post
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.360]   that I think was a important point
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.040]   is that WikiLeaks chose to involve themselves
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.720]   with media organizations here.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.320]   They could have just released it on their own.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.800]   They chose two for various reasons.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.280]   But I think the important thing about that
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.680]   is that journalists added value.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.400]   They added value in terms of the ability to promote this.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.840]   Because it was exclusive, they paid attention to it.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.400]   They brought more mature judgment about what was safe and unsafe.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.080]   They brought perspective.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.040]   I think there's a lot of ways that we look at this
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.800]   and say that it's very easy now for news to be spread
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.880]   at a marginal cost of zero from whoever has it, whoever
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   wants it.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.320]   The journalists have to ask where they
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.800]   add value in that transaction.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.840]   And the WikiLeaks story to me is a fascinating example
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.960]   of how someone came in.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.760]   And we can think saw value to be added
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.320]   and be that the news organizations really did add value.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.200]   Yeah, I thought that was the most interesting part.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.800]   They released it to these three old school newspapers
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.840]   first to give them a chance to turn it
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.880]   into the Pentagon Papers, in a sense,
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.640]   to analyze it and to distill it.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.720]   But that didn't mean that a month later,
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.000]   they didn't release all the documents as well.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   They did both.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Right.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Right.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.280]   And what Jeff said is true.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.160]   It's a very good illustration of how traditional news
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.440]   organizations still add value.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:39.560]   And I think it would have had much less effect if they didn't do that.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.360]   However, there's another aspect to it also, Jeff, which is that
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   WikiLeaks discovered that if it simply puts documents that have great stories in them
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.200]   online, what will happen is that journalists will ignore them.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.520]   And the reason that they'll ignore them is that they can't be guaranteed that if they
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:12.720]   do the work and extract the story and figure out what it is and publish it, that somebody
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.600]   else won't beat them to it.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.120]   And so this frustration that Julian Assange had that great stories buried in documents
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:29.480]   already online were going ignored or being ignored by journalists is part of what was
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:38.640]   behind his decision to give the Times, the Guardian, and Der Spiegel an exclusive, which
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:46.080]   is a peculiarity, a quirk, if you will, of press culture because we tend to think that
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   journalists will do anything for a scoop.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.600]   They'll do anything for a great story.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.280]   That's the thing that really motivates them.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.280]   That's their bread and butter.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:02.120]   But it's not entirely true because there are a lot of stories still within documents that
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:10.720]   WikiLeaks has made public that are just sitting there without being reported on because they
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:21.560]   don't fit the peculiar competitive conditions that prevail within professional journalism.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.360]   So how does this change?
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   Does this intermediate consumers of information?
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   It sounds like not.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.600]   It sounds like it in some ways elevates traditional media.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   Yeah, I think it does.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.800]   I think that's the point that Jay brought out that's really important and that WikiLeaks
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.600]   saw, but it doesn't happen.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   What it said, thanks to Jay, I'm working my book.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.040]   I've been reading James Kerry, who was a brilliant professor at Columbia.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:58.560]   And as Jay explains in a preface to some of his essays, that Kerry saw that there were
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.800]   two ways to look at journalism, and one was as a communicator of information, a transmitter
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   of information.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   And that's the way journalists often see themselves, but that's not where the real value is.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.880]   But the question is that in Kerry's view, Jay will correct me.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.800]   I'm sure if I'm wrong, Professor, because I'll get it wrong.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.960]   He knows it far better than I do, but there's a conversation going on in society and that
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.320]   journalism is there to reflect it.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:25.480]   And I would say these days to enable it and not just to inform it.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.640]   The starting point is not the journalists, the starting point is the conversation, but
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.960]   the journalists think they're the starting point.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.920]   And so I think that what this does, they could have gone to a better paper than the Guardian,
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.520]   full disclosure, I write for them, but I think the Guardian is brilliant.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.680]   I asked Alan Rusperger in email, the editor of the Guardian, whether the Guardian should
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.160]   have started WikiLeaks, were they jealous of this?
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.280]   When the Guardian saw Huffington Post, they said, "Crap, we should have done that."
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.760]   So they started to comment, "Is free?"
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.760]   Their version.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   And Alan said, "No, they shouldn't have started WikiLeaks because they do different
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.360]   things.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.320]   And there are things that the Guardian does that WikiLeaks wouldn't and vice versa.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.200]   And the Guardian and the Times and Der Spiegel are far better targets for government and
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.480]   companies than WikiLeaks."
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.200]   So what you see automatically is what you said, Leo.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.120]   You see a new layer of a new kind of collaboration that occurs and that they're dancing around
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.760]   each other and trying to figure out what this is.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.320]   Well, Leo, we want to get Kevin in here, but on your question about disintermediation,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.880]   it is that in one sense.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.520]   We have to realize that there are different kinds of leakers and leakers have different
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.840]   motives.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:44.800]   And if the aim of the leaker is to influence the discussion going on among elites, which
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:51.080]   is very often the motivation behind why people leak documents, the whole history of leaking,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:59.800]   which would be a fascinating tale, is maybe 50% or more a result of contests for power
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.040]   inside institutions of government.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.680]   Yeah, most of the White House leaks are from people who want to assert a certain point of
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.040]   view within the White House conversation itself.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   Right.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.760]   So what you have, the dynamic, which is centuries old, what you have is internal contests for
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:23.400]   power, whether it's within Parliament, Congress, White House, or even a corporation.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:33.000]   And the loser decides to go public by leaking key information and changing the battlefield
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.360]   as it were.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:43.200]   So if a leaker's motive is that is to get information out to affect a conversation going
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   on among elites, then WikiLeaks is disintermediation because all they care about is that other
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:57.960]   people who are tuned enough to this issue can read and find out what's going on.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.640]   And it's really the other kind of leaking where you're trying to affect public opinion
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:12.360]   and public conversation that still requires in some ways the resources of journalism.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.760]   But we should also recognize here that the balance of power is very different.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:24.400]   Bill Keller, editor of the New York Times in reflecting on these events, made it clear
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.520]   that, well, WikiLeaks was going to publish this whether we decided to join or not.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:36.800]   In that sense, WikiLeaks was in the driver's seat as opposed to the newspaper.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.400]   And they had to decide whether to play ball or not.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.120]   And you know that Assange has smart enough to go to the Washington Post or the Los Angeles
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.440]   Times or Time Magazine if he had to.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:57.480]   And so in that sense, even though the traditional media is still essential, they aren't in the
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.320]   powerful position anymore.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.600]   One more thing is that the White House, which has absolutely no context with WikiLeaks whatsoever,
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:13.280]   had to use the New York Times as a go-between to contact WikiLeaks and urge them to at least
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.400]   redact important information.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.480]   So now you have the New York Times, which ordinarily is the one going to the White House
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   and saying we have these documents and we're going to publish them because we have a source.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.640]   Instead, the traditional newspaper, the New York Times is in the position of being the
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:37.120]   negotiator or go-between between WikiLeaks and the White House, which is something completely
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.680]   new and novel in press relations with government.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.960]   Is this a one-time-only situation or is this going to be the new way things are done?
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   Is this a beginning of a trend?
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.720]   Put yourself in the position of somebody who is a whistleblower and has documents that
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.760]   really should be public.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.200]   Who would you rather deal with?
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:05.160]   A news organization that could be subpoenaed or WikiLeaks, which has put so much effort
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.200]   into being completely secure.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   And stateless.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   Yeah, and stateless.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.480]   And just think about the incentives and the risks for the leaker.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.600]   If you think about it from the leaker's point of view, you know that this is not the last
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.200]   time this is going to happen.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.120]   Adding on to that too, one thing I learned from the Sunday week.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.120]   Go ahead.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.640]   Learning from the Sunday week of leaks dump is that I don't know if it's a feature they
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.080]   have now or if they plan to put it into the future.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:36.960]   But people who have information, insiders of companies or government can, I believe they'll
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.720]   now be able to go to the leaker's, release it to them and then tell the leaker's, "I
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:48.080]   want you to pass this to Dr. Spiegel, New York Times, the Austin American statement if
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.800]   you have a local story there."
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.960]   And like I said, I don't know if that's something they're doing now or if that's a plan for
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.040]   the future, but I thought that was a really interesting change in how leaks happen.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.640]   Like Jay was just saying, would you rather have, would you have, like, your unpaid attorney
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.400]   and getting information out or would you rather just take your lock with whoever your
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   local paper is?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.440]   Do you, Danny, have any concern that there might be a backlash?
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.800]   I mean, I think there's a large portion of the American public who is outraged by this
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.360]   and believes the White House and now I hear that 100, what was it, 100 names have been
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:25.600]   revealed of informants in Afghanistan and believes that this leak was actually dangerous
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.280]   and that WikiLeaks is irresponsible.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.680]   And I'm sure there was the same backlash over the Pentagon Papers, by the way.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.880]   But do you think there might be a backlash against this and in fact a kind of return
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:43.120]   to a trust in, ironically, in the New York Times and traditional media?
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   Yes.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:54.520]   I mean, I think Julian Assange, the prime mover in WikiLeaks, is in a very delicate situation
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.680]   with the legitimacy of his own organization.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:07.840]   And in this particular story, if he doesn't redact the right names, if he does put people
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:19.200]   at risk, if he fails in a pledge he's sometimes made to do no harm, which I think is an important
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.520]   ethic for what the leaks to have.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:28.440]   And the legitimacy of his organization could really be in peril.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:38.400]   However, what's different here is that even if WikiLeaks is regarded as a dubious organization,
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.840]   even if people attack it and don't trust it, if it's documents we're talking about and
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:52.200]   they are authentic, it could still have a lot of power, even if people don't treat it as
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.760]   a legitimate news organization.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:00.560]   And that's what's so compelling and so disruptive about it.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.880]   Julian may not care if he's considered a rogue as long as he continues to be able to do what
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.880]   he does.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.760]   He doesn't care about legitimacy within the frame of the nation state.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.320]   He does not care about that.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   Right.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   Explicitly.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:21.480]   Yeah, I think that it is part of me a polyanomot here.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.680]   But if you're sitting in any organization and let's forget, not forget this is not just
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.160]   going to be governments.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.920]   It's also companies.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.120]   At some point, as I said earlier on, it's a glib line, but the only sure cure for leaks
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.520]   is transparency.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.920]   At some point, you're going to realize that you're better off releasing more information.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.080]   That the more you hold secret, the more risk you have of leaks and anything that looks
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.160]   like a leak looks like an expose.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:54.320]   Now, that's going to be a very hard lesson to get across to controlling institutions.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.840]   But I think if we're looking for a long term impact here on the culture, and I'm right
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   about this obviously, so it's on the top of my brain, but I think that this default of
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.520]   publicness versus a default of privacy and secrecy is what we're grappling with here.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.000]   And we get to a point where there is no mediator.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.400]   We are all media and we can all communicate with the world.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.440]   Even if you don't go to the New York Times, you can publish something.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.160]   You can put a document up and you can say, "Here, here it is."
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.200]   And there are other means to be anonymous.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.160]   And anonymity is always going to have its place, whether we like it or not, in crappy
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.640]   little comments.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.880]   And so in the end, no secret is safe.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.000]   Now some secrets should be, but here's another angle of this.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.560]   There are efforts to get obviously every single bit of communication done in the White House
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   to be recorded.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.680]   And there are those who complain in the Bush White House and are complaining right now
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.280]   that certain emails are being done on private platforms.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:55.080]   And that sounds like a flag to salute that I would too, that we want to ultimate transparency.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:00.680]   But there's a risk here, which is that if everything you say in writing could come out,
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.880]   you're going to stop saying some things in writing.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.160]   And that's a danger too.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   That's a risk too.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.680]   So we're trying to find a new balance to this idea of publicness and privacy in this.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.640]   And I think it's going to be a very long time before we see this shake out.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   Over and out.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.040]   It's just a fascinating story.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.120]   And I think with big impact.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.960]   And it's what we talk about on the show last week with respect to individuals here with
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.880]   respect to institutions.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:34.840]   Are there different issues for institutions, Jeff, versus for individuals?
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.080]   It's a choice any individual can make.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.280]   Who makes the choice for the institution?
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.760]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.840]   I think that the individual starts with does start with the default of privacy.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.520]   My thoughts are my own.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:53.560]   And I think that the organization has to shift to be profoundly radically public if it wants
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:59.840]   to have trust that anything it hides, anything that will not make a parent and available
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.880]   and public will be seen as a reason for suspicion.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   That's not going to be true in our private lives so much.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.440]   So it's actually a higher.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.440]   It's a higher standard for institutions.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.080]   It's a higher standard for institutions.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   It is.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.080]   I think it is in the long run.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.960]   They don't see it yet, but I think it's where it'll go.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:21.440]   Well, and because of the fact that institutions can really impact us all, we all, when it
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.640]   comes to the institution of government, for instance, there's a much higher standard for
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.800]   government to be transparent than there is for an individual.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.880]   We demanded of government.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.440]   We ought to demand it of government.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.240]   And I presume that that's what's going on.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.280]   This is something it's funny that the fourth estate has always been charged with doing.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:42.640]   Ricky Leaks really becomes a very powerful tool now for that kind of transparency.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.240]   I think part of the challenge.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.840]   And it's not just Ricky Leaks, Ricky Leaks.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   Go ahead.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.280]   We'll let J. Talk and then I'll give you a chance, Jen.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:59.480]   Well, part of the challenge here is not just that institutions have to adjust to new rules.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:10.160]   It's that the whole culture of professionalism in American life and in Western societies
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:20.560]   is deeply based on the control of information and the control of image.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:32.200]   And to try and reconstruct what a professional is when information is deconrolled is really
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.440]   a challenge.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:40.520]   And so it's deeper than just institutional life.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:48.840]   And what I think what happened is that the long age of mass media, which in some ways
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:59.480]   went from 1830 to 2000, gave professionals, people inside institutions the illusion that
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.320]   they could control information indefinitely.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   Like that was sort of the nature of the world.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   Right?
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.320]   It's our charge.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   It's our mission.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   Exactly.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   It's our right.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.120]   It's our destiny.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:23.520]   And it's sort of hard for them to appreciate that almost everything they know how to do
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   is based on that.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:33.640]   So what I've been trying to puzzle through is the shift in terms of authority and also
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:41.760]   in the nature of trust from a world where it's possible to control your image and to control
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.720]   the release of information.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.040]   To one where you can't do that anymore.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.000]   And you simply have to be open.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.400]   As Jeff says, you have to say where you're coming from.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.760]   You have to say here's the data.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:04.080]   You have to assume that people are going to find out your secrets, right?
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.480]   And still try to generate trust under those conditions.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.400]   But governments will argue, and I think people are arguing now, we need some secrecy in order
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.320]   to operate effectively.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.720]   Let's say we want to kill Ben Lodden.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.520]   Don't we need to be able to operate in secret in some situations?
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.840]   I think that is true.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   I think that is a good point.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:36.360]   And in the personal space, we need some sphere of intimacy, of privacy in order to have public
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.080]   selves in the first place.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:47.720]   But even though that's true, you may still face a disruption, right?
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.680]   That technology is bringing about anyway.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:32:00.200]   And that's why it's such a challenge to institutional dominance and professional authority.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:07.360]   And it's far from clear how the institutions of modern life deal with this.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.680]   So it's a challenge.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   This is difficult.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.200]   It's a challenge to know what to do.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.760]   It's also a challenge to know how to think about it.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.280]   Even to what language we should use for it.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.160]   It's really, I mean, this technology is so universally disruptive.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.760]   We see it in business, in content creation, and now we see it in government.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.320]   And it's the same answer each time.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.480]   Yes, it's disruptive.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.440]   Yes, we don't know exactly how to talk about it, to think about it, to deal with it.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.640]   But one thing we can agree, it's happening.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   Right.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   Jeff, go ahead.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.800]   Oh, well, no, I just, here's a silly example from this week where I think that this becomes
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.200]   a story, as we discussed last week, about technology and change and fear.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:59.720]   There was a Wall Street Journal story this week about Walmart putting RFID tags on pants.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.520]   And I love your response to that.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.520]   Yes.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520]   We've got.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520]   Oh, man.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.760]   I got the survivalist who came to me who said, you don't want people, the fear was, the fear,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.240]   there was this woman in the story who thinks that honest to God, and then the Wall Street
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:21.640]   Journal quoted her as if she were a reputable source that RFID tags are an evil plot, an
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.920]   anti-God plot.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:31.960]   And so what the fear was that they put forward is someone would come and scan your garbage.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.520]   And so what, they find out I'm 33, not about 32.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.720]   You know, then what, what is it?
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   What does that do?
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.480]   We don't look at the implications, but technology yields change and change yields freight and
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   freight yields protection.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.560]   And that's a very small example of what J. just said, whether you're a big institution,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.000]   or whether you're a survivalist, or whoever you are, there's two responses to this world
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.240]   coming up to embrace the change or to try to fear it.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.800]   I just read a book about the war between the Google referred to it.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:08.440]   This document back to the FTC, about the war between radio and newspapers back when radio
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   came to threaten them.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   And they used sacred language or saying this was a sacred cause that newspapers had.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.840]   And if you disrupted it's bad.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.840]   And now even RFID tags are a matter of somehow sacredness and the secrets the government
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840]   needs.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.840]   Yes, we need secrets.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.920]   But first you have to have the trust to know that those who are holding secrets are holding
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   them for a reason.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.920]   Interesting.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.920]   Very well said, Jeff.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.880]   All right, we're going to take a break because we do have a limited amount of time to do this.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.680]   This conversation is a great conversation.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.480]   We are going to do a government 2.0.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   Android.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.960]   Yeah, we're going to get to Android for Kevin's left out in the cold there.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.040]   But we're going to get to in just a bit.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:52.240]   I do want to mention that we are doing a government 2.0 special August 16th, 11 a.m.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:57.840]   with Tim O'Reilly, Carl Malamud, and many members of government to talk about transparency
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:03.440]   issues within government, how technology is being used to promote transparency in government.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.880]   And I think it is a very important conversation that's kind of an adjunct to this conversation,
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.160]   which is really about how the new role of journalism and of the citizen journalists
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.080]   and the stateless journalists, all of which very interesting.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.880]   Jeff Jarvis is here as usual.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.760]   Gina Trapani cannot be here.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.680]   She's got a little take a little time off sometimes, of course.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.400]   But fortunately we got Kevin Purdy here.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:31.160]   She's on her way to supernova.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.320]   I'll just let you complete this.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   Sorry.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   No, no.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   The latency is getting longer.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   And I apologize, Jeff.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   Yeah, that's where she's going to supernova.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   So it's not exactly.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.760]   Gina is on her way to supernova at Philadelphia.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.760]   Excellent.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.280]   And we will have her back next week.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   Kevin Purdy is here.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.560]   You know, I have to do hand signals, smoke signals.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.560]   We'll figure out a way.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   Kevin Purdy is here.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.240]   He's from lifehacker.com and also the Android expert, the author of a new book, which is forthcoming
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.360]   called The Complete Guide to Google Android, just as Gina's done The Complete Guide to
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   Google Wave.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:03.120]   Jay Rosen, an expert, and a great commentator on journalism is also with us and professor
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.720]   at NYU of journalism.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.000]   He's at pressthink.org.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.400]   We will be back in a moment.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.480]   I'll give them all a chance to grab a bite to eat or to think a little bit as I talk
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.120]   a little bit about our friends at carbonite.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   Carbonite.com.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.200]   Carbonite is a backup that happens automatically without you thinking about it.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.040]   Not to a local hard drive.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.800]   Carbonite has some advantages over the local hard drive.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.320]   I don't think it's a bad idea to back up to the local hard drive as many backups as
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.320]   you can make.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.640]   The better, the happier I will be.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.680]   But if you don't have an off-site backup, you're missing an important detail in backup.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:44.440]   What happens if the worst happens, fire or flood and all your data is lost because it
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.840]   was sitting right next to the original?
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.480]   I should just go to carbonite.com and use the offer code Twig.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.880]   Let's do that.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.720]   Carbonite.com/Twig won't work.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.120]   Carbonite.com and then the offer code Twig will work.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.680]   If you use that, you will get two weeks free to try it out.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   Now here's what's going to happen.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.160]   You're going to put it on your system.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.720]   Carbonite will start backing up your personal data, your emails, your financial records,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.160]   pictures, music, the things you hold most important automatically to the cloud using
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   128-bit SSL.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.320]   Here's the beauty of it, something you can't do with an external drive.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.680]   You can get it back anytime.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.120]   On any computer, you just log on to your Carbonite account and there's the data.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.440]   They even have a free iPhone and BlackBerry app for you.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.760]   Computer disasters happen.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.000]   Data does get lost.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.840]   Computers get misplaced.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:36.400]   Your laptop, I'm sorry to say, hundreds of thousands of laptops are lost each year.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   Back it up, please.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.560]   Do me a favor using carbonite.com.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:45.000]   Offer code Twig and if you like Carbonite and decide to buy it, you can get it two months
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.200]   additional free by using Twig as the offer code when you buy.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.040]   Let me put this in the lower third so you can see how to spell Twig.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:01.400]   If you don't know how to spell Twig, now you know Carbonite.com offer code Twig.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   We use it.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.800]   We recommend it and I encourage you to do the same.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:11.840]   Back to our conversation, Jay Rosen, Jeff Jarvis in the Poconos and Leo Laportk Kevin-Purdy
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.160]   is it here also from a lifehacker.com.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.760]   And now we can talk a little bit about Android.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.160]   I hear there's a root, a one button root for the Droid X Kevin, am I crazy?
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.360]   Should I do it right now?
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   Right now?
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   I don't know.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.200]   But there is a one button root.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.800]   I think a week ago it was a whole process with the terminal and all that.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.640]   Yeah, it's just a root.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.120]   It's not a complete firmware, a white brain thing.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.240]   Well, that's what I was concerned about because we'd heard about the E-fuse.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.720]   This will not trigger the E-fuse on my Droid, right?
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   I don't believe so.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:52.320]   I believe it's just a root that lets you in at the level so that you can remove what
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.760]   everyone's complaining about the Droid X is.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.560]   The junkware, the crapware.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.240]   The whatware or crapware?
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   Whatever you want to call it.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   You know, that stuff doesn't bother me.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.280]   You can't uninstall a lot of the Motorola apps.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.920]   Same thing on an HTC with the Samsung or the Samsung which has a lot of crapware on it.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   But that's just a make-con timing.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:14.840]   I was amazed that the sense phones don't let you at least go back to Google stock.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.560]   That's a major complaint of mine.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560]   Well, I have that too.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.480]   For instance, it's not using the Google SMS on the Droid X.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   So there are a few things.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.120]   I wish I could use the Google stock applications.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   You're right.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.280]   Well, the Droid X I think has enough memory where it's not a big issue.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.880]   8GB of app memory.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   So there's plenty of room in here.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.880]   There you go.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.480]   But I mean, some people really don't like the feel of scrolling through their app tray
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.520]   and seeing things they can't remove.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.120]   So especially Android users.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.920]   I mean, I don't want to typecast.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.360]   But people who like to feel like they've got an open phone and a phone they control,
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.480]   a phone they can set up a portable hotspot with.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.040]   They don't like seeing, even though it seems like a really cool game, need for speed on
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.240]   their phone and they can't pull it off or whatnot.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.560]   So this eFuse story I think is a little overblown.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.000]   I don't know an Droid X.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.640]   So your mileage may vary.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:15.000]   But I believe that there is now currently a route that just gets in and gives you the
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.560]   access and doesn't change firmware or do anything else that would trigger what you
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.800]   call a boot back to the rescue.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.720]   Whatever you call it, I'm sorry.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.720]   According.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.400]   Yeah, they go to rescue mode and then you have to put a new firmware on it.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   They say the bootloader.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.400]   Right.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.400]   The bootloader.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.640]   So Apple decided that they were going to, that they were maybe a little threatened.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.640]   I don't know by the Droid X.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.640]   So they put out a video.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.360]   Which has since disappeared, I believe, showing the Droid X antenna.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   Yes.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.640]   And the Blackberry and the, I believe the HSC incredible too.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.720]   Showing that if you hold it, I believe the Google phones, it's the bottom of the phone.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   Like this would be a kind of death grip on most HTC.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.440]   Have you been able to get it to happen?
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   Oh, I'm on T-Mobile.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:04.320]   So I don't know what would be amazing service drop down to Evo.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.480]   I like Snowball actually.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   In Buffalo, it's fine.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.560]   I hear it's not so good, you know, New York or LA or whatever.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.640]   But I can't get it to happen on Verizon.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   Period.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.560]   No, I've never been able to replicate it.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   But I wasn't, I wasn't looking for it.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.080]   Like a lot of iPhone owners would be iPhone owners are much more aware of their service.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.080]   It seems.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   Right.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   Right.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   How about the Poconos, Jeff?
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   Is it working up there?
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.760]   My AT&T is actually working very well here.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.840]   You know, the AT&T, I mean, the Apple response with those videos seems to me rather childish.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.440]   But Joey started it.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.440]   I know you are.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   But what do you do?
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.440]   It doesn't really fix the problem.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   Right.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.960]   I like how someone pointed out that now attenuation has become a common word that like they've
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.400]   spread from like, you know, wireless engineers for the general public like, oh, does your
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   phone have attenuation?
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.720]   Well, I know I can see that you're detuning your antenna when you hold the phone like
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   that.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   That's just not appropriate.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.240]   Good news for Nexus One owners.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.840]   We thought that the Nexus One was dead.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.080]   It looks now like the HTC folks are just going to take the AMOLED screen out of it because
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:15.880]   they're in short supply and use super LCD in it and the incredible and still offer those
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.640]   phones for sale somewhere.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   Google's not going to sell them.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   I don't know where you are.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.640]   Mobile stores are supposed to get Nexus One.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   I think it's not going to.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   Say again.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.440]   T-Mobile just said if we look up that they're not going to sell it.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.800]   Oh, so that's sad because I think this is actually the really great.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.440]   Google phone experience with 2.2.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.000]   It's even with the super LCD screen, which is actually still a pretty good screen.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.040]   Some people were saying that like the Android stock experience, the Nexus One, what it really
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.840]   does, I believe it was on during firewall too, is that what it does is it shows you what
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.640]   a phone is like without carrier or manufacturer intervention.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   And unique.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.600]   It shows you what your phone could be like if they didn't want to have you using AOL,
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.520]   or whatever else they jam on your phone.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.720]   Not the incredible the desire.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   Thank you for the correction, Mastermind.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.560]   I meant the desire.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   Ah.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.560]   Yes.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.480]   Changing Google voice.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.600]   Direct access numbers for speedier dialing, which eliminates unfortunately the free calling
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.040]   trick people have been able to use.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.480]   So if you're on Android or BlackBerry, there's an update that allows direct access number.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:33.040]   In other words, it's a unique outgoing call number to everybody you dial.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.680]   Which is really great for people who don't have a great data connection, maybe at home
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.520]   or wherever they are because previously the phone would a Google voice app would reach
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.560]   out to the server, contact it, let it know that you're trying to call us on the number,
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.040]   retrieve the number roughly and send it to your phone.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   It's fun.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.400]   Yeah, it was five or six seconds.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.040]   It's embarrassing to pull out your phone and be like, I'm going to call and I would
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   repeat it.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   It calls you back.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   So weird.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   It basically calls you back.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.560]   But now I believe it stores the unique numbers that Google voice generates for everyone in
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.920]   your contacts in your phone.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.120]   So it's pretty instant now.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.880]   It's just like calling on a regular connection.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.560]   Unfortunately, it'll cost you minutes now.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.680]   The old trick that you're referring to is the one where you are the plans where you have
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   your five friends that you can call forever.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.320]   You just assign your Google voice number as one of those friends and then, yeah, unlimited
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   calls.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.600]   I think carriers were kind of pushing away from those, have been pushing away from those
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.840]   circle of friends plans anyways.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:38.400]   I didn't use it because who wanted to sit there while you make a call and wait for Google
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.400]   voice to call you back.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.080]   It just was a pain in the butt.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.120]   It's pretty fast now on the Nexus one even on T-Mobile.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:50.640]   Yahoo Japan has chosen Google for its search engine, which is kind of bizarre.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.960]   Yahoo in the US uses Microsoft.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   The pause.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   They slapped both Microsoft and Yahoo US.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.680]   They slapped everybody all around.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:12.960]   Yahoo Japan is a different owner, at least majority owner, I guess.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.760]   We'll just cut the pauses out.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   I feel so stupid.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.280]   Jay, if you have anything to add to this, please do.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.520]   But don't feel like you have to stick around either if you're not at all interested in anything
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.760]   we're talking about here.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.560]   You wouldn't believe how backward my phone is.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560]   What are you?
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   What are you?
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   What are you?
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   I actually have.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.640]   I'm not joking up.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:52.320]   I have an AARP phone that has absolutely no internet access at all.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:57.160]   The only reason I have it is in case my daughter has a problem at school or something like
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.160]   that.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.920]   I'm not even mobile.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   Wow.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   That's very interesting.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   Did you get on?
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   Sorry.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   Could resist.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   Right.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:13.560]   It's my curmudgeon self coming out.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:20.720]   I want to ask Kevin about the two things.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.400]   One is that Lionel Menchaka at Dell said that they've gotten more pre-release interest
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.040]   in their five-inch Android device.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.840]   Who's name I'm suddenly forgetting?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   Street.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   I'm before.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.840]   Street.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   Right.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   Street.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.440]   And then there's this weird thing about the Algin, the $150 Android tablet that is now
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.840]   in the Kmart circular and appears to be real.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.840]   How could it be?
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   $50.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.360]   Well, not only, well, it's in the circular, but it's apparently not in the stores because
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.160]   everybody who's tweeted me has said, I don't see any.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   I'm looking for them.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   They're sold out.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.120]   Have you, has anybody seen one?
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.400]   No, I haven't.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.560]   I mean, what does it end gadget said that they didn't have?
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.880]   They called one and they said, no, we don't, you know, we don't have it in stock and couldn't
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.880]   give any information.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:10.040]   But Android 2.1 and two gigs of storage and I don't remember how much memory, but it was,
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.920]   I can't even do the math of how that's $150.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.520]   It's got to be some horrible in there.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.520]   I mean, it can't be.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.040]   It's got to be an atom processor or something.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.440]   I mean, there's, there's shots of it.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:25.040]   I mean, that doesn't prove anything these days, but it seems interesting.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:30.120]   I, I just got to wonder about how Kmart is going to be the avatar of Android marketing
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.280]   for a tablet.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.360]   How Kmart or, you know, any other similar non electronics store is going to be the one
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:41.040]   to push an Android tablet and get it and get customers to know it and want it, I guess.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.840]   Well, but Dell on the other hand, absolutely good.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.160]   Well, that is, that is it.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.160]   Sorry.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:54.200]   Yeah, I think, I think, but I think somebody like Walmart couldn't be the one to make Android
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.800]   go ballistic over.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.600]   Yeah, that's possible.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:05.240]   I mean, they, they, for a while, Walmart was selling $150 Linux based computer that
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:11.600]   was based on GLS, which was actually just a Google obsessed Linux operating system.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.160]   And I think it, they sold some, but I believe they eventually kind of canceled the, the
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:20.000]   project, but I, I would be really interested to see, you know, kind of mass market stores
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.760]   pushing an Android tablet and just, and totally just, you know, putting it in the market as
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.440]   the, the cheaper non iPad, I guess.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.880]   I haven't played with any of those.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.160]   So I can tell you how they work.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:35.440]   The Google, the Dell streak is a five inch tablet.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.560]   They're, I think they're under $500 Kevin.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:38.560]   Is that right?
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.200]   Yeah, roughly something like that.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.680]   And so a lot of pre-orders.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.640]   A direct editor to the iPad.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   A lot of interest in that.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.000]   I'll, I'll order one and get one in a house as soon as I can.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.200]   I would love to.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   I would love to.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.640]   Is it AT&T only?
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.120]   I think so.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.120]   Yes.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   It's kind of too bad.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.280]   How does AT&T get this?
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.760]   I have no idea.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.520]   Can I take my AT?
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:07.920]   Can I take my iPhone SIM out and put it in the, the Dell device?
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   I don't know.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   You couldn't do that with, you could only do that with scissors for the iPad.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   I don't know.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.760]   Because it's a micro SIM.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   It was a micro SIM.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   And the iPad.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.280]   But I would presume the streak is a micro SIM.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.120]   It's only, I mean, why everybody's moving to micro SIM.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.080]   It is a streak is unlocked.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.680]   Although I guess they sell two flavors locked and unlocked, right?
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.520]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   From what I've read.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:37.000]   I'd have to think AT&T is doing something with the SIM in a 3G iPad to keep you from doing
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   exactly that.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.440]   They must, I can't imagine that they're not checking something.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.560]   But why is it there?
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.560]   It's not.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.120]   I don't see whether it's against how it's against AT&T's interest to have you use the
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.480]   same account on multiple devices if you could only use one at a time.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.120]   I'll tell you why.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:01.440]   It's against AT&T's interest to piss off Apple in any possible way.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:08.200]   Because the Apple is so anxious to get rid of AT&T that if I were AT&T, I'd be groveling.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   I'd be on the floor.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.440]   I'd be crawling to Steve saying, can I shine your shoes?
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.280]   Can I get you anything, Mr. Jobs?
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.440]   Is everything okay?
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.440]   So they're not going to do it.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:21.560]   I mean, they're going to be very careful, I think, to protect Apple's business interests.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.640]   According to that Wired story, they could do all that.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   And it still wouldn't matter.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.080]   I mean, it was a Wired story from two weeks ago detailing the relationship between Google
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.080]   and...
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.080]   Wasn't that something?
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080]   Excuse me, through an Apple AT&T.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.080]   Wasn't that something?
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   That was amazing.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.720]   To see behind the curtain there and to see what was going on, and Steve Jobs saying,
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.720]   "I'm going to call up.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.800]   I'm going to call AT&T on Yale, Adam.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   These guys are..."
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   I mean, it was just...
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.640]   It was amazing to see this.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.840]   And talking about a shift in balance of power, there is a big shift from the cell companies,
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:53.280]   which really have dominated this market and dominated the handset manufacturers.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:57.920]   And here comes Apple and just becomes totally the boss of that relationship.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:03.360]   AT&T, the former ruler of all telecommunication in the United States now has to...
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.360]   Grosveling to this...
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.720]   Grosveling to this hippies.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.120]   These hippies in Apple.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:17.240]   You, Jeff Bookmarked, an interesting story, a quote from Eric Schmidt.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.720]   Google, of course, supposedly creating a Facebook social network.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   Everybody has confirmed it.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.040]   Kevin Rose gave it the name Google Me.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.480]   Adam D'Angelo said, "Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.760]   He's the guy at Quora said."
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:36.480]   Now the journal, even the journal says that the Google is trying to do something.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:42.360]   They acquired Playdom, or a social gaming network.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   Advanced...
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.120]   And invested $100 million in Zinga.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.240]   We're going to have to tell Eric Schmidt, though, because Eric said, "The world doesn't need,
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.480]   quote, a copy of the same thing."
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   He says, "Facebook is good for Google because Facebook users use more Google products than
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:04.440]   other users."
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.640]   He said, "We haven't announced it.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.920]   You can't expect a partnership with Zinga."
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:16.000]   But he says, he sounds like he says, "We're not doing a Facebook clone."
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   This information from Eric Schmidt.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   Yeah, I don't think that they...
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.560]   If Eric's wrong, then count the days to his departure.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.280]   I can't imagine that he is.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.200]   It would not make any sense to try to be Facebook against Facebook.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.280]   Google's too smart for that.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.480]   They're going to look for that unique thing.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.080]   I think that there's some criminal analogy to be read in the fact that Rick Cloud won't
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.920]   come on our show yet, because he's working on profiles.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.360]   And I think there's big stuff coming up with profiles and big different opportunities with
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.600]   Google, and we'll see where that goes.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.920]   But I don't think it's going to be a clone.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.920]   I think he's right.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.160]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.280]   So it's really parsing his sentence.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:59.360]   Yes, we're going to do a Facebook thing, but it's not going to be a clone.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.760]   It'll be green.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   Right.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760]   I mean, that...
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:07.320]   Well, I mean, even look at the fact that Amazon this week, it indeed...
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.760]   Why don't fully understand or in a move I don't fully understand, they're going to use your
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.120]   Facebook friends in terms of purchases.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.760]   And so Facebook becomes a given.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   And the question for...
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.560]   It's just like Zinga is a given.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.480]   In games now, Google was a given in the world.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   Could they become the next altivist and be destroyed?
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   Yes, anybody could.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:32.160]   But I think if you look at a world of givens and say, "All right, what the smart thing to
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.440]   do is figure out how do you deal with this thing that we can't get rid of, that it's
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   just there?"
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.360]   And so Facebook is the thing you can't get rid of.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.360]   It's there.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.200]   And Google will find clever ways, I think, to work with them.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:50.000]   And the thing to read into what Schmidt said was that they sell different advertising opportunities
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.960]   and Facebook is good for Google, as Google believes that everybody who uses the Internet
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.200]   is good for Google.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:02.160]   I for a moment I say, "A world of givens is in monkeys."
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:09.200]   And you know, from my point of view, there is something about Facebook that reminds me
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   of a world of givens.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.800]   Here's an interesting security and privacy story.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:24.920]   According to Thing, 100 million Facebook user pages were scraped by a fellow from Skull
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.160]   Security and placed on BitTorrent.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.920]   None of this is illegal.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   Rod?
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:36.360]   There's the entire directory of everybody who has not changed their settings or have intentionally
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:41.000]   made their themselves public, but they probably did not presume that they would be combined
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.640]   into a 2.8 gigabit file that becomes a, I'm sorry, Jeff, a Stalker's favorite toy.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:52.320]   Yeah, I mean, not just names and URLs, but some of this stuff has phone numbers depending
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:56.680]   on whether people were paying attention when they looked at the privacy settings or maybe
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.000]   there are people like Jeff who just like to, you know, put their pants out in public, but
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.760]   it does raise it on or off.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:11.400]   It does raise a very interesting point, 100 million out of the 500 million Facebook users
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.080]   apparently don't care if there's stuff's public and now it's available for anybody who
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:18.840]   wants to download from a BitTorrent site.
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.680]   But at some level, you want to make control of this all true, but at some level, you know
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.200]   what, let me bring something to you.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.480]   Do you know the phone book used to put out this whole thing with all your addresses and
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.680]   phone numbers in it?
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.160]   That's true.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:36.000]   On the other hand, you couldn't really download it as a 2.8 gigabyte BitTorrent file, but
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   it was better.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   It was paper.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   We love paper.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Paper's right there.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   It's on your shelf.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.680]   It's hard to do jokes with this, with this flag.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:50.080]   Timing is everything.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.160]   What about this proof of concept?
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.640]   You know, actually, I really like the new Google Maps.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.560]   So Google Maps got a big update this week, at least on Android.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.000]   I don't know if it also got updated on iPhone.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   I think it did not.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.080]   It was just an Android thing.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:09.440]   So they added, I haven't even counted them all, but I think four new icons in my environment.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.160]   No, there are four now total.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.760]   When you first Android, it was just Maps.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:19.880]   And I guess just user interface decisions, it's now broken off into, there's the Maps,
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.840]   and then there's the latitude has its own separate icon.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.200]   Navigation has its own separate icon.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:31.480]   And the one they just added was Places, which is what's near me right now.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.880]   Instead of having to go to the map, have it figure out where you are, this one can do
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.720]   restaurants, coffee, bars, hotels, attractions, ATMs.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.720]   So it's a--
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.720]   It's Yelp-ish.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.480]   And in fact, it includes Yelp reviews in here.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:48.040]   Yeah, and the same kind of aggregation that Google does with Maps, it shows you all the
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:52.840]   reviews that they could scrape, and then even color-coded to show you that this place
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.200]   is generally getting four stars, five stars, and that type of thing.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.760]   I actually like it, but this isn't anything different that you could already get in Maps,
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.160]   it's just it's got its own call out.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.160]   Is that the--
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.120]   Yeah, just now you don't have to go search for a place or click on a street near you
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.200]   and find this.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:13.680]   Now you can just directly have your GPS unit tell you what's nearby.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.480]   But in another story in the Fred feed, what people are wondering was, well, Google's
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.720]   doing this, Google's taking one application and letting it split out into four different
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.720]   icons.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.800]   I wonder if other applications can do it.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.960]   And so someone came up with a proof of concept app.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:34.080]   I think it was just called app launcher spam or something.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:38.680]   And he managed to put 20 different icons on his phone.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.440]   If you install this application, whose only purpose is to do this, it would just--
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.720]   Spam, it's your app drawer.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.440]   Now, uninstalling it removes it, but it is definitely a proof of concept, isn't it?
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:56.800]   Yeah, I mean, and it relates to the general issue with the Android market and the other
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:02.960]   big market issue this week was the Google removing, I believe, 3,000 applications, but
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:10.840]   1,000, 3,000 from one particular-- from three particular developers and 6,000 spam apps,
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   Wow.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:18.360]   From three different developers who are mostly doing the kind of wallpaper, ringtone, stuff
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.120]   that you hate to see in there when you're just looking for something real, full of copyright
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.720]   violations, full of junk.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.280]   And Google removed them unilaterally.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:33.520]   And one of the developers contracted the Android guys blog.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.560]   And the quote on the headline was, "We will flood the Android market."
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.720]   And he revealed in Broken English that he owned three or four other development names
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:46.160]   and that he has more than 1,000 apps still on the market.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.280]   So it's a great problem to have to have an open market and deal with guys who want to
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:59.880]   do nothing but put out usher ringtones and Twilight wallpapers at all into infinity.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.800]   I'm glad that Google is doing something about it.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.920]   They also extended the refund time frame.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.400]   This is something the Apple Store does not have.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.520]   And I think is a really good feature.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:14.080]   You have 24 hours-- if you buy an app-- and by the way, most of the apps on the Android
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.240]   store are free.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.320]   But if you buy an app on the Android store, you had 24 hours to uninstall it.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.840]   And automatically, you'd get a refund.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.680]   Now you have 48 hours.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:27.560]   And in most cases, if you buy from the marketplace anyway, you get a refund automatically.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.840]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.240]   Which means that you can try any paid application for two days.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Jeff, go ahead.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.040]   Yeah, Kevin, I'm a flak of a school teacher.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.200]   Can I talk now?
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:45.920]   I talked about on the show occasionally saying that I think one problem for Android is that
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.600]   it is hard to find the good apps.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.320]   And it's going to be like the whole Google verse that there's spam everywhere.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.360]   And there's junk in there.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:58.080]   What do you think about the quality of the Android marketplace and what do you think
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.960]   Google is doing, can do, and should do about quality?
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.200]   Well, let's see.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:09.160]   The savvy folks who-- the Android power users, the Android geeks, usually we're going to
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.800]   go to a place like AppBrain, which you guys have talked about on the show.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800]   Love it.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.800]   Love it.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   Love it.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   Love it.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   Love it.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   Love it.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   Love it.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.800]   Love it.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.800]   Love it.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800]   AppBrain.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.560]   Some of the other third-party search engines whose name's this gave me right now, but that
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.600]   have decent ranking listing.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:36.200]   And most of the apps that are recommended on those sites are by real Android users that,
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.840]   you know, like good stuff.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.400]   And I can imagine that I wake up every morning and read RSS feeds for LifeHacker.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.480]   So I'm reading like 10 Android blogs every morning.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.120]   That's-- yeah, you can find great apps that way because they're doing all the curating.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.840]   I think it's a pretty big problem for Google.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:00.680]   And I like to see them taking steps like this, like wiping out the obvious, you know, install
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.680]   bait, I guess is a word now.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.200]   But I also wonder, you know, when they're going to have their Apple moment and overstep,
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.520]   when they're going to, you know, do the-- when they're going to start removing things that
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.880]   shouldn't be removed.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.160]   And it hasn't happened yet because the market is still very flush.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.560]   If you have a favorite, is AppBrain your favorite?
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.640]   There's Andro Lib is another one.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.280]   There's a number of different choices.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.640]   AppBrain, because of that fast web install feature they have.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   Love it.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.080]   If you don't have Froyo yet, this is the best way.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.360]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.200]   So when everyone gets up to Froyo, including those Verizon users who rumored to get it
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.680]   in mid-August, AppBrain has a fast web installer that is awesome.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.560]   And you install the AppBrain application and fast web.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.160]   And whenever you're on the AppBrain website, you can just click and all of a sudden you
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.520]   look on your phone and it's downloading.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.760]   And it's-- that's the future.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.760]   There's also-- Android now has an automatic update in 2.2.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.920]   Has an automatic update feature.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.960]   You could check a box that says, "Look, I love this app.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   I love it."
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.960]   And if you're not, you can just click on it.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.960]   And if you're not, you can just click on it.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   And if you're not, you can just click on it.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   And if you're not, you can just click on it.
