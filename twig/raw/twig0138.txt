[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.900]   This show that covers Google, the Googleverse and the cloud.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.400]   And yes, my son has written us a new theme song.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.900]   So I'm going to play it for you guys a little bit later on. You can decide if you like it.
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.400]   But let's first welcome our regulars to my left, Gina Trapani of Smarterware.org,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   the founding editor of Life Hacker, creator of ThinkUp app.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   The amazing application that keeps track of your tweets.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   Hello.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.900]   Hello Gina. Good to have you.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.900]   Jeff Jarvis is also here from the City University of New York where he's a professor of journalism,
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.400]   the author of Public Parts and what would Google do and he blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   Hey.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   And he said, "What did you say?"
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.900]   "You weren't sure if you were going to go to Google I/O because you're not a programmer.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.900]   You would feel like a little old lady."
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.900]   And a rave.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.900]   And a rave.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900]   I need your advice.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.900]   We'll talk.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.900]   Are you going to be standing there with my thumb somewhere? It shouldn't be?
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   We'll talk Hermione. We'll just hang in there. We'll get to you.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.900]   All right.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.900]   Birthday.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.900]   Also joining us from the altimeter group, a guy I've known for years and we've been trying to get on for a long time.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900]   We just haven't been able to coordinate Jeremiah.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900]   Oh, Yang is here from, he's an analyst at the altimeter group.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.900]   It also blogs a lot about media, social media, media in general.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   Just everything going on in the world today.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.900]   It's great to have you, Jeremiah.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.900]   Thanks for having me, Leo.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   Gina, Jeff, hi.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.900]   I think we agreed to have you on this show last year on the plane back from Southwest.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900]   Yeah, I'm finally getting on.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   But we needed somebody who actually went to Southwest because the three of us decided, "Why did we decide, Gina?
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.900]   It was just too much of a party and not enough content."
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.900]   Is that what we did?
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.900]   For me, too big. Too big. Too much.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.900]   The reason why I don't go to CACS.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.900]   It just felt like a little too much this year.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.900]   My first year after six years is not going.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900]   And you had FOMO.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.900]   Was your FOMO survivable?
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.900]   I had some FOMO. I mean, I have a personal policy, no FOMO.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900]   But I had a little FOMO, all of it that I did.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.900]   Fear of missing out? Are you missing out on this chocolate pie?
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   I am definitely having FOMO about the pie.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900]   That is cruel.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.900]   That is a banana cream.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900]   Oh, that looks amazing.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   You know, it is Pie Day 3.14.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.900]   And it is going to be 159 during this show.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.900]   Oh, at 159, let's all jump up and down and do the pie dance.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   We'll do the pie dance.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.900]   Good.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.900]   And you can torture us with more pie.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.900]   We got pies everywhere because it turns out there is a pie place around the corner called the All-American Pie Company.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.900]   And we bought pies like all kinds of pies.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.900]   They even make savory pies. We didn't get any of those.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.900]   And Jeremiah...
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.900]   It is not happy about it.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.900]   Yeah, Jeremiah knew because he brought me an apple pie.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900]   Where is that from?
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900]   That is from across the street.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.900]   That wonderful...
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.900]   Oh, the grocery store.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900]   Petaluma, which is great.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.900]   It is a lot of market.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.900]   We are really blessed with very fattening food all around us at all times.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   So, Jeff, Gina, and I forgo for when to a South pie.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900]   You know, in the past, Big News has broken there.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.900]   Twitter was basically launched at South Pie.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900]   Four Square, same thing.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900]   It's been a while since anything. Big was launched.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.900]   Was there any news at South Pie?
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   Well, I mean, there was no big breakouts, Leo, at this time.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   And there really hasn't been for a number of years.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.900]   No.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.900]   But what was interesting is because there were so many people, over 25,000 people, 27% more than last year.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.900]   Gina started going when I was, what, 700?
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   It was small.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   But I don't know that it was that small.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900]   But it was small and it was all in the convention center.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.900]   And you'd walk by your friends in the hallway, you know, and have great conversations.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.900]   No, no more.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900]   I mean, let's just start from the registration.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   Some people were in line for an hour to get their badge.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   Now, Leo, this is a digital conference.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.900]   And people are waiting line.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.900]   What do you need a pair of badge for?
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.900]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.900]   So, there's significantly a missed opportunity.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.900]   And then it started pouring rain, horrible Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.900]   So, people barely went about the streets.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.900]   So, people were clumped together.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.900]   A lot of the fun of Seth by is hanging out on the street.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.900]   That's what Austin is.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.900]   Absolutely.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   It's just going down to six three and just every party on the street.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.900]   That's right.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900]   Having fun and just the serendipity of it.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.900]   So, what we saw was people were using smaller apps to find more intimate conversations with folks.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.900]   So, I saw a pickup of Group Me.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.900]   And that launched that South by last year, but it was picking up more.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.900]   I liked Group Me.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.900]   We actually, that's what we decided on using internally for our messaging when we're at CES, for instance.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.900]   We also saw a pickup of highlight and Glancey.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.900]   Have you seen those?
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.900]   That's what everybody thought would be the two battling apps.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.900]   I have highlight on my iPhone and what it does, it lets you know if friends of friends are nearby.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.900]   Proximity.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.900]   Couldn't have been very useful at South by since everybody was all jammed together anyway.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.900]   Yeah, there's a little bit too much noise in there.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.900]   It's like everybody's there.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.900]   Oh, everybody's here.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.900]   Everybody's here.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.900]   Glancey, we used it to Le Webb, I think.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.900]   And it's a way to plan what was a plan your conference kind of?
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.900]   No, no, no.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.900]   It's more of a proximity.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.900]   It's also proximity as well.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.900]   And then we saw a lot of 4-square check-ins because a lot of people were claiming the buzz badges.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.900]   Right.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.900]   4-square is smart.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.900]   They use it to promote.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.900]   Absolutely.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.900]   What's sad is Goala turned off its server that day.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900]   And that was another one that launched at South by their from Austin.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.900]   It must have been a sad day, kind of.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.900]   Nobody noticed it.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.900]   Nobody noticed it.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   There's too much going on.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   Go Hula?
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.900]   There was, you know, there's just so many social networks.
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.900]   And therein lies the problem.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.900]   I mean, there's more than that.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.900]   There's Echo, Banjo, Sonar.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.900]   They're all proximity social networks.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.900]   So there's just a rash of them right now.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.900]   And did Oink die?
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.900]   Because I just got an email from Oink saying, "Here's all your data."
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.900]   And I'm seeing in the chat room.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.900]   No, I decided to shut it down.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.900]   Wow.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.900]   Milk just decided to focus on other things and said, "Thank you.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.900]   You can download your data.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.900]   We're going to have another announcement soon."
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.900]   So I think they're subscribing to the whole.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.900]   Try something out.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.900]   Fail fast.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.900]   They said they would do that.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.900]   And, you know, it's easy to say.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.900]   And most people just hang on.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.900]   Oink is only a few months old.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.900]   And it was really fun.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.900]   I was very active.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.900]   I liked the Oink sound.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   But like all of these, there's so many of them.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.900]   I got bored with it.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.900]   And I stopped using it after a few weeks.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   And I guess Kevin Rose saw the writing on the wall.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.900]   And they, and they, I was wondering why I got that.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.900]   What does Nink do?
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.900]   Is milk doing?
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.900]   We don't know.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.900]   But that was one of the things Kevin said is try many things and fail fast.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.900]   That's really, and then they, what I admire is they have sent me a link.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.900]   I didn't even request it saying, "Hey, Oink user, your Oink data.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.900]   You can download it from the link below for the next 48 hours."
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.900]   And do what with it?
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.900]   I don't know.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.900]   But I guess I should get it.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.900]   You know, I think more, I think this, you're right.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.900]   Do what with it.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.260]   Every company that goes out, Goala didn't offer me that.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.500]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.700]   If you wanted it, it's your data.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.700]   So, um, pre-
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.140]   Yeah, feature zero.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.140]   That's the, yeah.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.140]   Feature zero.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.900]   Yeah, what I get, the data that I put in out.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.900]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   I worry about path.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.900]   I put so much on path.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.500]   Paths always said, if you want the data, you can get it.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.100]   You can email them or?
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.900]   Yeah, but you have to email them, which is a little weird.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.900]   Okay.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.100]   There's a, there's another interesting thing that people are waiting in line to spend
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.180]   170 bucks on.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.580]   And this one is a new thing.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.020]   It's called the Nike fuel band.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.020]   Have you heard of that?
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.020]   I see them everywhere.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.020]   And I bought an up.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.020]   I've got one.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.020]   I bought a Jumbo and up.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.020]   It's a lot bigger than the up.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.020]   It's a, but it does have a LED.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.260]   So what does that mean?
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.980]   Jeff, those, uh, light bars there.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.980]   Those light bars?
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.820]   Well, what it means is that I haven't met my goal yet today.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.860]   My fuel is 1385.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.860]   My goal is 2000.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.860]   Is that steps?
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.660]   No, that's fuel.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.460]   That's a kind of new currency that you see.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.460]   You can compare things.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.340]   There's a calories, not very many.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.500]   I've been sitting in my desk all day steps, very few.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   And what time it is.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.500]   You need to do the high dance.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.940]   Oh, so it's a watch.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.180]   And it was that too.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.180]   Yes.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.660]   And then you, so here's the USB.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.660]   I like that.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.980]   That's integral, which it was not on the up band.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:12.980]   Right.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.420]   And it thinks, uh, with, through Bluetooth to your phone.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.420]   I like that too.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.420]   That's how the fit networks.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.420]   You don't have to.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.420]   Very good.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.020]   I, I will say that I've had to reset it most every other time that I sync, but, but not
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.500]   kind of what it still works.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.340]   And then on your iPad, iPhone, let me see if I get that out.
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.220]   It'll show you what you've done day to day, whether you've hit your goals, all this neat
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.220]   stuff.
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.820]   And you know, it is forcing me, even though today I'm stuck at the office all day, it
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.180]   has forced me to, to just because it exists to walk more and the run more.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.180]   Are you wearing one, Jeremiah?
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.620]   No, I didn't have one, but there's no way.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.700]   Oh, but wait, I like your Wi-Fi cuff link.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.700]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.700]   You like that?
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.700]   I'm not sure if you're going to get one on the cuff links.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.700]   Nice.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.860]   We don't have a zoom, so there's no camera operators.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.900]   He's worked in television a little too.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.780]   Can you, can you, can you get a shot of that?
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.780]   No.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.820]   As a matter of fact, no.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.380]   So was everybody wearing fuel bands?
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380]   It does.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.380]   No, no, no, 170 bucks a pop.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.220]   Not, but everyone's going to get one.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.220]   They're expensive.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.380]   Some VIPs were, you know, touting them around.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.780]   So, you know, you said, well, look, Jeff Jarvis, Jeff Jarvis, for sure.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.700]   I went to a Nike event and thus got it.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.700]   Oh, cool.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.300]   Yeah, because I don't think you can get sold out.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.300]   You can't get it right now.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   We're sold out pretty quickly.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   I mean, I tried to buy it.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.100]   Oh, well, it's not coming out.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.100]   So should I get one?
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.100]   Do you think it's a good thing?
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.100]   I think it's pretty neat.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.100]   I mean, it doesn't have the sleep thing that the UP has.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.180]   The UP is going to have a new version coming out.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.100]   But yeah, I like it.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.980]   It's not for my ideal.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.700]   I don't bike, but it's, so it'd be, this is one thing about Nike Plus.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.300]   It's really run focused, right?
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.300]   That's right.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.940]   So the downside of the fuel is, and I was talking to the folks, is it's measuring the
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.940]   movement of your arm.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.940]   Right.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.260]   So you can add it and put it on your ankle.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.260]   I suppose you could.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.260]   If you bike.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.500]   But it's not gathering heart rate or sweat or GPS.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.260]   It's pretty limited data capture, quite honestly.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.260]   It is.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.100]   But you could buy a watch for that price that would do much more.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.100]   Yes.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   But it's cool.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.100]   But it's very cool looking.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.700]   And it has also showed, you know, event in New York, they also showed, I don't want
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:22.140]   to talk about this before, basketball shoes with five sensors in them.
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.540]   And I think we've started with this before.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.820]   It does all kinds of data for you playing.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.900]   They showed, you know, a pickup game there.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.420]   And even though with that, which is so the advance, you can see where this is going.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.380]   It's more, and this is one of your trends out of South by Jeremy's more, more things
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.820]   that, that are, you're my, I'm sorry.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.460]   The internet, internet of things.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.460]   Things, right.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.220]   And things connected to you.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.300]   So it even will show you how high you jump.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   Wow.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.540]   And you can make a YouTube video, you can make it, make an iPhone video, right?
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.780]   Have somebody pointed at you as you play a basketball.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.940]   Oh, and we'll put your stats on the video.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.500]   The stats on the video.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.500]   That's kind of cool.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   Right.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.820]   So you have proof that I jumped, you know, 18 inches or whatever that it is.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.500]   And that has a high cool factor.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:14.340]   And they're also, they got a various celebrity jocks to do routines on this.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.900]   So Rafa has one for a tennis workout that's not, you know, it's not tennis workout.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.820]   It's an exercise routine.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.940]   And you compete against goals on that.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.740]   If you have those shoes and stuff, right?
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.020]   So, so you can see where this is going is it's before the Nike Plus was just the thing
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.660]   in your shoe for running.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.260]   Now it's got this, which we'll sink through Bluetooth.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.940]   And then it's going to have more, I think connected things on your clothing or your shoes
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.980]   at least and neat things can come, but it's going to start with basketball.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.580]   Samsung had a, the sponsor, the blogger lounge.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.620]   And they were showing off some of their TVs that, I mean, this is tying into the Internet
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.620]   of Things.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.620]   Almost all the TVs are Wi-Fi enabled as you might imagine.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.220]   But now they're starting to put facial recognition, gesture recognition and voice commands.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.500]   In fact, even the remote for the Samsung has a mic on board.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.260]   So you can talk to it and you say hello TV and then it starts to activate.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.180]   So, and then Chevy was showing off their, the Wi-Fi networking 4G that they're starting
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.020]   to put into the vaults.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.980]   So we're starting to see all these technologies come together at the Internet of Things.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.980]   Of Things.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.580]   Stop me and ask you for your, for your Ford.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.060]   I saw a story that there was an upgrade.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.060]   Or an upgrade.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.780]   They shipped to 300,000 My Ford Touch owners because, you know, when my Ford Touch came
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.740]   out, it was kind of an upgrade on the Ford sink, which I have in my Mustang.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.260]   And it got just panned.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.460]   Consumer reports that this is terrible.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.180]   It was a user interface, not a functionality, but just user interface was confusing and
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.260]   difficult.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.620]   And to their credit, Ford stepped back and said, yeah, we blew it.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.900]   And they have their, they're shipping USB keys with, I haven't tried it because I don't
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.900]   have my Ford Touch.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.620]   I have to go out and find one with an upgrade to the software.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.580]   You put it in your USB port in your car and the car upgrades itself.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.580]   Jesus.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:10.620]   Well, and you saw Samsung is one of the companies that are considering hardware module upgrades.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:16.140]   So Samsung wants to realize is that you aren't going to buy a new big screen TV every year,
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:21.420]   but people come, become used to the idea of upgrading their phones every year or two,
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.060]   upgrading their software and operating systems all the time.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.820]   So they're starting to put things like the DSP chips that do upscaling at other hardware
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.260]   components in an upgradable module in the TV so that next, you can buy next to your
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.820]   Samsung module and plug it in.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.860]   And Ford has talked about this when I talked to Alan and Lalliam asked him about it at
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.860]   CES.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.580]   Yeah, we're going to do that for cars too.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.220]   So not merely software upgrades, but physical hardware upgrades that you drive to the dealer,
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.220]   they plug it in.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.420]   Now you got the 2013.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.740]   So it is interesting is where personal computer technology or personal electronics have influenced
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.580]   durable goods significantly.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.100]   That's why you're seeing apps and TVs and all that.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.060]   So one of the, I work at a research firm, Altimeter, and one of the research themes we're going
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.840]   to be looking at this year is on around this thing of Internet of Things and Big Data.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.300]   And the research question we're asking, and I'd love to hear everybody's opinion, is
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.900]   in who's smarter, a college graduate or tomorrow's refrigerator?
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:23.660]   And I think we can actually make the arguments that tomorrow's refrigerator is smarter than
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.820]   a college graduate.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.820]   Why?
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.180]   Well, it can save self maintain itself, self clean itself.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.540]   It can order in food and feed itself and know what's for dinner next week.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.220]   And I don't know if college graduates can do that.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.940]   Certainly college freshmen, I would say.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.240]   Maybe if you graduate from college, you'll learn how to clean yourself, but yeah, I agree
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.240]   with that.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.920]   My, my daughters will be a sophomore next.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.000]   I completely know cleaning is not number one, two, three or four.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Wow.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I don't know.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.600]   You know, we've talked for years about this smart refrigerators.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.680]   In fact, I can remember CES is an even convex is where companies Samsung this year showed
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.000]   refrigerators with screens.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.640]   Remember all this has been going on for years.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.400]   The Audrey remember that was the kitchen computer.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.140]   And it's always flopped.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.460]   It's always flopped.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.540]   You know, I'm back to my.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:17.140]   I, this is, we, this was off the year, but I showed people before the show started.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.140]   This is how I do a grocery list.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.380]   It's called a piece of paper.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.220]   We're going to have, we're going to have me ask.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.180]   Yeah, but it's been the chat room already knows.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.180]   Chat room already knows.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.900]   This is, you put a piece of, you put a adding role in here and you write down your grocery
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.900]   list.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.900]   This works so much better.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.360]   I have to say, because it's so tedious and time consuming to enter a list into a device
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.740]   that you know that gene.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.020]   That's why you did to do that text.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.020]   It's text based.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.460]   There's even a little holder right here for your stylus.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.460]   I mean, stylus.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.460]   Yeah, right.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.460]   Style is.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.460]   Sorry.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.460]   Sorry.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.740]   Where's the stylus?
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.180]   Where did the batteries go in?
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.980]   So sometimes I think we can overdo it, can't we?
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.180]   Well, if people are going to buy it, somebody's going to make it.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.180]   Right.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.060]   Actually, this was hard to find.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.060]   Only the Germans.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.180]   So this I bought.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.400]   Oh, get ready for this.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   I bought a grocery list computer.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:13.600]   A couple of years ago, it came out, you talked to it and it was such a pain in the butt.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.360]   Milk, milk, not 2% milk.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.040]   And your list was just confusing as heck.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040]   So I gave up on that.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   And I'm.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.440]   It was a computer dedicated to your grocery list.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   Yes.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.440]   What was that called?
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.640]   Wait, is it a computer on your refrigerator?
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.240]   I'm sure they stopped making it.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.480]   Which grade level do you think that one was?
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.020]   Well, it was an interesting idea.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.720]   Smart shopper was called.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   Smart shopper.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   And they still sell it.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.580]   So you can, if you all want to run out and get one, grocery list organizer with embedded
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.580]   thermal printer.
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.380]   Now you're laughing at me for spending $38 or whatever it was on this.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.360]   This was $150.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.660]   And I bought it.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.640]   I think I bought one for my mom too.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   And you talked to it.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   Oh, thank you, dear.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.200]   I'm sure I'll use this.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   It drove you.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   It drove you.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.320]   Crazy.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.760]   You press the button and you say milk.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.600]   And then it's, I mean, there's some intelligence.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.160]   It could perhaps sort it into aisles of the grocery store.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   So there's a voice to text.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   Is that what it is?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160]   Okay.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.160]   But not very good.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.160]   I mean, that's the problem.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.160]   All of this promises.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.480]   That's why I need GPS for the grocery store because it doesn't make it the grocery store
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.640]   layout makes no sense to me for the rare times that I ever shop.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.640]   They still sell this.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.680]   Well, you know, Jeff, the groceries, I work as some of these retailers.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.400]   The grocery stores are designed for you to traverse the whole store on average.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   Right.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.080]   They don't want you to go right to what you want.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   Anyone on a Vegas hotel.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.720]   I'm just going to say, I beg your hotel to get to the cab line without going through
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   the casino.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   Right.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.200]   Exit through the gift shop, I believe is the term.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   Anyway.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.280]   So you guys want to know another crazy.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.280]   This is good.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.200]   You know all the secrets of these companies.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.160]   I work with big corporations all the time.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.680]   And so strategizing things like that.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.080]   Yeah, I do research and then our company helps them.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.600]   You know, Charlene Lee, Brian Solis, we all work together.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   I know, Brian.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   He's great.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   You should have them on the show too.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.520]   You had trouble getting home from South by understanding it all comes down to this.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.840]   We're going to take a break and we're going to find out why Jeremiah O'Yang is now on
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   the no fly list.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.920]   Jeremiah is with the altimeter group, Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trappani also here.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.920]   More to come.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.120]   In fact, there's some actual Google news.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   But we wanted to get that.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.600]   We wanted to make sure that nobody had FOMO for South by.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   No FOMO.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.360]   You feel better now, don't you?
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   It was rainy.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.400]   You couldn't talk to anybody because they were all huddled.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.840]   Except we hung out with Jeremiah, you know, our points of all the marketing people and
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.800]   company people there, which is what we've seen.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   And you know what?
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   That's okay.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.840]   That's why the, you know, a lot of executives there.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.240]   He's being about South by was I never gave away business cards there.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.120]   And I think it's more of a business card place now.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.920]   Yeah, it is used to be.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.480]   I hosted an executive cocktail session.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.120]   There's a lot of corporations, a lot of branding.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   But this is a site.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.120]   Leo DiCaprio was there.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   And I'm going to go to the restaurant.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.640]   The celebs are here now at South by interactive.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.280]   Another reason I don't want to be there.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.040]   So we saw Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.880]   We saw Toby McGuire.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   Really?
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   I said, like to me.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.920]   Jimmy Fallon was in the W and he held the elevator open for my wife and I was a gentleman,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   apparently.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.440]   So they're all investing in like companies like Mobley and what have you.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.080]   So they're looking at Ashton and Gautre of all things.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.160]   I'm sorry, I'm eating pie.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.080]   I thought it was a break.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.440]   Ashton Kutcher is a thought leader in Hollywood.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.040]   Who would have thunk it?
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   Who would have thunk it?
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.840]   Well, they all go for interactive and stick around for movies and music as well, right?
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.320]   Jimmy was in for just 24 hours apparently.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   Wow.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.320]   And then you know, Jay Z.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   That's a slightly.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   Was there.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.960]   So George Clinton, the Funkadelic.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   Parliament Funkadelic.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.240]   You even know who that is.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.960]   I'm so impressed.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   I'm so impressed.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.880]   See, we're not the only oldsters here.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.880]   Jay Z, really?
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   Jay Z was there yesterday.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.240]   I mean, it was in an Austin state of mind.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.680]   So the biggest change for this though, Leo, is that the celebrities are not really Kevin
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.280]   Rose and Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   Right.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   Right.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.800]   Now the celebrities are actually celebrities and Leo.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   They're actual celebrities.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   No, you're still a celebrity.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.480]   Instead of the Urzet celebrities.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.520]   Well, yeah, no, Ignatian didn't do its big event.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   That's right.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.840]   Because they're, you know, defunct and.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   Leo LePort, fucking.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.080]   I don't, I think Kevin did not go to South by as a matter of fact.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.560]   He did not go.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:37.280]   No, in fact, I remember him tweeting from the sample Fartiloung saying, am I missing anything?
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.160]   So I think he did not even go.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.480]   It times are changing.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.160]   And I don't know if it's good.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.560]   I think it's bad.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   Let's talk.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   Let's go ahead.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.520]   Leo, you want to make your own South by using video.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.760]   Right.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   We're distributed now.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.200]   We have the technology.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.560]   We could do it anywhere.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   Yes.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   And now it was.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.720]   Did you see Zuckerberg?
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   Was he there?
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   I did not see him.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.160]   No, I know who was there though.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.800]   Sean Fanning was there.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   I'm sure.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.280]   Sean Parker was there.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   Sean Parker was there.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   That's my man.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   Sean Parker, not Sean.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.280]   Yeah, Sean Parker was there.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.840]   In fact, Sean Parker had a party.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.000]   I was who was it with with another with like a real celebrity at South.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.680]   Sean Parker was interviewed by Al Gore and I watched the Twitter feed and it was like
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.520]   all these controversial interviews at South by Southwest over the years of Mark.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.920]   Yeah, it was Al Gore.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   That's what it was.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.120]   The problem was everybody said, why does he ask a question?
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.680]   It's exactly the problem with every one of these interview sessions.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.960]   The interviewer never asked questions because he's Sean Parker.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   He's not a professional trained journalist.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.120]   No, it was Al Gore who was supposed to interview Sean.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   Wow.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   That talk about the world.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.440]   So the former vice president of the United States, the guy who was almost elected but president
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.160]   of the United States but missed by a hundred votes was interviewing Sean Parker.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   Yes.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   Okay.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.160]   Go to your.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160]   Okay.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   Wow.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:10.720]   I feel like I'm in the bizarro world at this point.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.760]   We're going to talk a little bit about go to my PC.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.120]   This is from the great folks at Citrix who do go.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.160]   Hey, I know Michael Guarnieri was there.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.320]   They had a great party last year.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.280]   They were saying, why aren't you coming to South by?
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.880]   They said, if you cover it, we will advertise and I said, I don't want to.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.440]   I don't want to have a good time.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   Enjoy.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   Enjoy.

[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   Bring elephants pie.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.280]   Those elephants are quite something down there.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.640]   They have a very nice playground.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   They do.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.640]   They do.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   The fire park is amazing.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.640]   It's like the wild.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.440]   And then you drive through it and especially design car that repels monkey poop.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.480]   It's a poop of phobic.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.480]   Poop of phobic car.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   Thank you.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.280]   Five minutes to pod.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   Okay.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.720]   Thank you, Jeff, for keeping track.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.000]   We're looking for 159, right?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.640]   Then it'll be 3141519.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   No, wait a minute.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   159.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:51.480]   She'll be waiting to 1539 or should we go 159?
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.280]   Oh, forget.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.880]   Moving along to another story.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.360]   No, you were going to tell us why this put you on the no fly.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.320]   It's not on the no fly.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   I'm not on the no fly.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   It was late.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.120]   It was like midnight and you know how six streets pretty crazy, right?
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.160]   We were loving college students come down.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.160]   We love it.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.360]   Yeah, because they want to.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.760]   That's one of the things that happens at South by is suddenly there's all these college kids
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   there too.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.760]   Right.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   And they're a little rowdy.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.160]   Yes, very rowdy.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.600]   So I was walking by myself to grab some pizza from I forget what the name of that.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.600]   A Ropalo.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   Ropalo.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.480]   I was by myself and whenever I travel, I travel a lot.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.880]   Always bring this with me.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.720]   This is a little LED.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   It's incredibly bright.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   This is 300 lumens.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.320]   I love that flashlight.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.720]   So this can blind somebody in the dark and there's another feature which is the strobe
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   on it.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   Oh, sorry guys.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.960]   But essentially, I lean.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   You have epilepsy?
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.760]   I think I lean just to seizure.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.640]   I always carry this with me just because you know, I never know where I'm going to be
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.000]   and I'm a little nerd, right?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.600]   So no, I think it's great to have that.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   And you can't take this on.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.560]   You can't take a knife or anything on the airplane.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   Anyways, so I was walking towards 6th Street and then I saw this sort of this bustling
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.280]   happening and then I saw a guy, one guy put in another guy, they're kind of drunk in
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.520]   a headlock and then the other guys, two other guys came up.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   What?
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.800]   I'm just having boots.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   Got milk.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.720]   I'm paying attention.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.560]   And this guys, they were punching him in the face.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.240]   It's hard for me to tell a story.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.720]   Welcome to Twitch, Jeremiah.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.480]   Okay, I'll focus on this.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.160]   And then they were fighting and it started to get really brutal.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.160]   That's not good.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.200]   It was three on one and then the girlfriend tried to intervene.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.600]   This guy was getting pummeled on the ground, kicked in the face.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.080]   Oh, Jeremiah.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.160]   And so I shined the flashlight on the guys and this is the most amazing thing because
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.000]   it's a really bright flashlight and it's like as bright as a cop's flashlight.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.360]   And then the guy, he instinctively, he went like this, what?
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.400]   And he put his hands up and he stopped.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   Awesome.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.360]   And the guy who was getting assailed turned around and threw a couple punches.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.920]   Someone that landed, some didn't.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.000]   So this light in a way turned the tide of battle.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.520]   And then the cops came rushing in.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.520]   Good.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.520]   And then they were just going to spray and start the re-guys.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.480]   And then I just kind of made a next hit really carefully.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.240]   So the moral of the story is the pen light is higher.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   Higher than the sword.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   It's a sword.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.240]   It's a sword.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.280]   Although if you'd had a sword, you could have chopped his head right off.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.120]   No, I'm not a violent person.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.280]   This is, which one is this?
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   This is the Phoenix.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.280]   This is the Phoenix PD-31.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   PD-31.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.960]   I bought this, I bought one for Charlene Ben-Parr who says hi, by the way.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.680]   Brian Solas, I bought some for my friends as well.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   So you're the Johnny Appleseed of flashlights.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   Lumens.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   Of lumens.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.360]   It's very, very, it's, they're a lot of fun to have.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.920]   Yeah, no, it's good to have a good flashlight.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.720]   This company makes a lot of them.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720]   With lumens.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.640]   Yeah, I come betting lumens.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.200]   You guys carry flashlights on you?
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.200]   I do.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   Good.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   Little one though, not like that.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   Yeah, I have a little one on my keys.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   We have that one too, that 900 will go down.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.480]   Well, you all get to be out here.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   Why do you say that?
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   I don't carry a flashlights.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   I'm planning on building my keys.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.240]   You need one for your key chain.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.360]   You know, it's funny, but the reason I carry a flashlight is because I'm waiting for the
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360]   zombie apocalypse.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.520]   And I know the first thing the zombies do is they cut the power.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.880]   All right.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.760]   And we all live in places.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.920]   We forget, but because we're civilized, quote, we live in places that if there is no power,
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.640]   we'll be pitch black, right?
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   There's no light.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.280]   Now here we, that's why I cleverly designed the studio with portholes to the outside world.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.280]   Nice.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.280]   Nice.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.560]   I don't need a flashlight.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.560]   You've got that's right.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.920]   He's got an iPhone light.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   Actually, it's pretty funny.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.120]   I had a contractor looking, we have some moisture in the crawl space and the contractor was
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.120]   in there.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.880]   And I said, well, you need a flashlight because usually contractors just pull out these big
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.000]   flashlights and says, no, I got my phone.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.160]   And he's a phone.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.320]   The Chilean miners actually got around through the iPhone light.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   Really?
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.800]   iPod light when they were stuck down there.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   Wow.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   Just like Jeff.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   Jeff, no mining.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   Wow.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   So you have the.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   I don't know if I have the same effect.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   No, wait.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.360]   I now 30, 30 yards away.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.160]   Actually, it might have because you like, I'm a dude, I'm going to put this on YouTube.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.560]   Might have stopped him as well.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.560]   Yeah, I thought it.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.560]   That's true.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.760]   You might have come and get taken your phone to know you're not.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.320]   Sir, what a great video though.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.000]   Geez, you'd be viral by now.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   What?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I could have made some money off of that guy.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.400]   You're a social media expert.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   What are you thinking?
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   It's pie time.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   It's pie time.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   Happy pie day.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.680]   Hey, hey, have some pie.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   What would you like?
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   Boston cream.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.880]   The one you didn't stick your finger in.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.960]   Yeah, that's by the way, this is very good.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.560]   This is peanut butter.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.160]   It has bananas.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   It's just mmm.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   Mmm.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   Mmm.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   Pie.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   Let's take a picture.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.920]   Pie for all.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:54.400]   The worst excuse.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.600]   Man, killing me.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.480]   You didn't come repaired, huh?
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   I didn't.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.640]   Why did we not FedEx pie?
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.280]   Oh, I know why, because the last time we FedExed you cookies, we couldn't find you.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.720]   I live in the computer.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   I live in the cloud.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.080]   They said there's no no.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.560]   There's no Gina Trappani in San Diego.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.840]   All right.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.840]   That's the peak.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:25.960]   For people who want to know, Fe and Ixlight.com, it's the PD-31-304 lumens.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   It's powered.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   It's LEDs.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.400]   It's these Cree LEDs that are so bright.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.240]   They have a CR123 battery.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.600]   Have you seen those?
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   No.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   It's just a regular lithium.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.760]   Oh, look at that.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.280]   That's a hell of a battery.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   They're high output.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.280]   These aren't little.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.680]   These are lithium, but they're a...
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.680]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.920]   You carry more than one?
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.440]   Those are batteries.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.640]   So look, so the question is how long does it last?
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.640]   Pretty long.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   Yeah, because it's LED.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   It doesn't use much.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.040]   It's 100 hours runtime on these batteries.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Dual CR123s.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   All right.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.200]   There you go.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.400]   See, we could zoom in.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   Nice.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.800]   Little did I know.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.560]   Moving along, there is news.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.320]   Google I/O!
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.720]   I bet you we should check.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.600]   Registration starts at 7 a.m. March 27th.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.640]   I bet you by 10 a.m. March 27th, it'll be sold out.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.640]   That's what happened last year.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.560]   It took less than an hour, in fact, to sell up.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.160]   This will be interesting, though, because apparently...
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.520]   Somebody told me they've doubled the price.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   To what?
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.920]   Oh, did I not say what it was?
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.920]   I didn't say Google I/O?
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.520]   I should have mentioned that.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520]   Oh, you did?
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.280]   It's the Developers Conference Google Developers Conference.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.120]   That's the one that Jeff Jarvis feels like.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:49.160]   He'll be a little old lady to rave.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.280]   So Gina, you and I both got our invites.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.560]   We got our press invites.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.760]   Now, the reason Jeff that you want to go, you go to this, Jeremiah?
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.040]   I've been to a few.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.640]   It's fun.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.480]   Last year they had a life-size human labyrinth game that you could write.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.680]   Was there humans in the labyrinth?
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.640]   No, you were just the labyrinth with your hand-roids phone.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.240]   You scared the labyrinth with an Android device, right?
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.320]   It was a giant news, yeah.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.160]   They've made in the past, they've made some interesting announcements, none of which have
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.240]   actually turned into products, and that's always fun.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:26.080]   Well, I'm thinking of the thing where you put your CD-- remember last year they put your
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.520]   CD on this special thing, and then the computer would know and have all the songs you would
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   even have to rip it.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   Oh, God, I forgot that one.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.520]   Like that.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   It's fantasy world.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.520]   It's fantasy world for geeks.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.760]   Did you see that the requirement to register is you have to use Google+ profile and Google
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   Wallet?
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.520]   Are you surprised?
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:50.200]   So it makes me wonder, will they eventually announce a developer platform for Google+?
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.400]   Yeah, you know, they need an API.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.400]   Gina, you know this.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   They have a read-only API.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.440]   They need a very limited API, yeah.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.520]   But there was an invitation to join the platform preview, which is basically just
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.320]   subscribe to a Google group, but it wouldn't surprise me if there were announcements about
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   that at Google.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.680]   That's what we-- what else would we like to see besides free stuff?
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   What else?
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   Glasses?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   We want the glasses.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:20.160]   Last year they gave out Toshiba Android tablets, 10-inch tablets, and--
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.160]   Samsung.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   Samsung.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   And then they also gave out a Samsung Chromebook.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.160]   Chromebook.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.200]   And as if that weren't enough, a 4G Verizon 4G MyFi.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   Oh, that's right.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   The MyFi, yes.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.920]   It's easy to forget when they give you so much stuff.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.160]   It was a lot of loot.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.000]   It's typically a lot of loot, which is kind of what the rush to register, I think, is
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   about.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   People want the newest stuff, and often the loot kind of almost equals the price of admission.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.720]   Although I don't know if that'll be the case this year.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.960]   See, I feel guilty, Jeff.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.160]   Should I not accept the loot?
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.680]   Is that a compromise of my editorial integrity?
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.640]   If they gave me pie, I'd have no trouble.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.840]   You know, Leo, it's all the same to you.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   It's all gadgets.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.960]   I mean, I did accept this thing, because I couldn't buy it.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.000]   I did just plug it and talk about it.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.080]   I should have made clear that that was the case if it wasn't.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   I think it was a terrible--
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.440]   You said you got it for free from--
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.440]   [SINGING]
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.040]   We're in touch.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   I don't--
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.800]   I don't think it's payola at that level.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.560]   I really don't, because it's devices you write about as long as you're--
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.160]   and you're going to be honest about it.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.400]   No, I don't think it's a problem.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.880]   I think disclosure is key.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.800]   Yeah, but I hear that all the time from--
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.600]   I started with Mike Harrington, but I hear that all the time for people as long as it's
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.720]   OK, do anything you want.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.040]   There's no ethical violations as long as you tell people.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   And I still think there's ethical violations in the world.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.080]   So we have a policy.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.040]   I get lots of free stuff, but we have a policy that we will use it, test it, then I will
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   give it away.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   You don't keep it.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.560]   Nope.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.840]   I've given away thousands of dollars of electronics.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.160]   But if I like it enough, I'm going to do the right thing.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.160]   I'm going to buy it.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.360]   Yeah, I think that's a good policy.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.640]   Yeah, that's what I do.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.240]   And I owned two Nexus ones as a result.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.600]   And I gave one to the school.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.200]   And I like it, and I bought it.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.920]   And yeah.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.160]   I bought my Galaxy Note.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.080]   God, I bought that.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.640]   It was like $7.5.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.440]   Wow.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.520]   But I love it.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.000]   It's funny, because you would say, well, wouldn't you love a free phone more?
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   No.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.320]   No, no.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.000]   You love your phone if you love it.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Right.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Anyway, anyway.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.800]   Yesterday, I have to admit, yesterday I did a session with a big consulting company and
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.000]   a bunch of major media executives.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.960]   And then I snuck in somehow.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.200]   And they were talking to a certain major technology company.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.960]   And I didn't get anything for it.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.840]   You'd see a connection, the big guy asks you, you say, OK.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.440]   So I did two and a half hours with this group.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.760]   And I thought, OK, at the end, this company also makes phones.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.440]   And I thought, maybe I'll get a phone.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.560]   Maybe I'll get something.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.160]   No, please.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.680]   Nothing.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.200]   Nothing.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.880]   You know, a little fake you give.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.080]   No.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.000]   Sharks.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.760]   So this is the funnest part.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.000]   And Gina, we didn't have to do this because we got a press invite.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   But if you're an actual developer, you have to actually build your invitation.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.720]   Wow.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.840]   You have to make your own.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.480]   So it's almost like an IQ test.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.760]   I write a passage.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   I couldn't get this to run.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.560]   Oh, no.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.120]   Up, ground.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.720]   Sorry, Gina.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.200]   We've rescinded your invitation.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.320]   Maybe because I'm not on Chrome.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.600]   Should I do this on Chrome?
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.040]   Oh, there-- whoa.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.960]   Hey.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.160]   Hey, it didn't put output.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.400]   Brush up on your geometry.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.760]   Dust off your protractor.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.800]   An architect a machine only you could have dreamt of.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.920]   Join developers tracking our latest Google experiment for a chance
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.280]   to have your machine featured at Google I/O.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.440]   And now, the parts.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.280]   Press the space bar, play, to launch a particle.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.200]   So you're going to-- you're building it.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   Whoa.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.200]   Oh, no.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.040]   Try grabbing a redirector from the toolbox
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.480]   to move the particle across to the output.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.960]   It's like the game app, perhaps.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.200]   This is cool.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.080]   That's a pretty cool invitation, right?
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:53.840]   It is.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.960]   So do you have a limited amount of time to do this?
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.080]   Or you do this now and fit it in?
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.720]   Well, I don't know.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.520]   And then you press play.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   And let's-- oh.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.960]   Where did the lemmings come out from?
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.920]   Whoa.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.840]   Oh, man.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.400]   I didn't do it right.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.720]   You're out.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.680]   No, you get another chance, don't you?
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.360]   Please.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.720]   Please, no, Google, no.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.880]   Sorry.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.360]   You could change the color.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.560]   I think you're probably supposed to turn it--
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.720]   wouldn't it be cool if--
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.200]   I think it's got to say Google, right?
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.080]   If you do it-- I mean, there's no right answer.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.760]   It is like apparatus, which is a really fun game.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.920]   But--
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.640]   Oh, we've lost-- Leo now.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:32.720]   Yeah, it's over.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.760]   I can't get rid of this--
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.720]   Thanks for a great show, everybody.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.000]   --thing that I made.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.280]   I was surprised.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:38.840]   Isn't that cool?
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.200]   Oh, it's a little bit time.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:40.800]   Isn't that cool?
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:41.920]   Should we check the movie?
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.800]   No, no, no.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.640]   This is better.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.160]   I have giraffes.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:47.640]   So anyway--
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.760]   You don't have to solve it.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.440]   Or do you?
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.640]   Maybe you do to get your invite.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.160]   Well, they kind of hinted at this, right?
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.000]   That you should brush up on your coding skills?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.520]   Look at this.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.480]   It's got source code.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.400]   You can modify the source code.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:00.900]   Oh, man.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.680]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.280]   This is somebody's 20% time.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:05.960]   Look at this.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.480]   And they've got--
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.320]   Oh, is that their timer?
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   That's us.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:09.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.320]   That's us violating the copyright of the Jeopardy show.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.720]   Mark Goodson built Toddman production.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.480]   Anyway, you got an elevator.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.040]   You got a track.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.640]   You got a wall.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.960]   You know there are going to be some wild ones of these on here.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.040]   I think this is great.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.680]   Are you going to do it, Gina, even though you already
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.720]   have your invite?
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.640]   Oh, heck yeah.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.640]   That's definitely going to be a fine thing.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.920]   That was pretty dang cool.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.280]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.880]   But I really want glasses.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.200]   OK, so let's talk about the free stuff.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:42.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.960]   Glasses.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.000]   These are the Google goggles that
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.360]   have augmented reality that as you look around,
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.520]   you'll see peanut butter banana pie.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.040]   Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.000]   Apple pie.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.080]   Doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.920]   Well, it's all the calories.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.400]   No, I hope not.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.640]   Actually, supposedly it is going to put stuff over people's
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.680]   heads, right?
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.440]   Like what?
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.680]   I don't know.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.320]   No, but they said they will not turn on the face recognition.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.960]   Well, I'm serious, guys.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.920]   Should I go?
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.520]   Yes.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.880]   I'm not a developer.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.280]   Well, Gina, I don't--
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.120]   You're a press.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.320]   I don't think you need to be--
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:20.840]   OK.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.320]   All right.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.960]   So you're doing it for this week in Google?
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.240]   No, no.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.560]   He's not saying that.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.880]   He just feels like he'll be a fifth wheel,
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.320]   because he doesn't speak Python.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.360]   But it's not like that.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.760]   There's a ton of technical sessions
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.600]   that happen in the afternoons.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.480]   But the announcements in the morning
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.160]   are applicable to everyone.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.520]   And there's going to be just tons of toys and exhibits
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.120]   and neat things to see.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.920]   And keen.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.960]   Like that maze thing that they say.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.040]   I can go to the Ikea Ballroom.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.200]   Where is it at this year?
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.800]   I think it's always at Moscone, isn't it?
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.400]   Yeah, I think it's at Moscone.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.640]   Yeah, so it's the June 27th to the 29th.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.400]   So they increased it to three days from two days.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.920]   I think it's a Wednesday to a Friday, which works for us,
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.000]   because the show is on Wednesday.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.360]   So we'll do the show probably after the Wednesday--
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.960]   We'll fly out, Jeff.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.280]   And then we'll do a show.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.320]   We'll go to the keynote.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.680]   They usually stream the keynote.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.440]   Yeah, they stream all their stuff.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.120]   So it will have to think about production.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.480]   But I guess we could figure out a way to do--
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.840]   what we'd like to do is commentary during keynotes.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.400]   But it's hard to do that when you're in the room.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.720]   And if you're not in the room, you don't get the goggles.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.440]   So screw the commentary.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.360]   And then--
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.480]   No, Jeff, you'll do the commentary.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.480]   No.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.960]   See, now he wants to be the little old lady at the rave.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.640]   Now he wants to go.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.680]   So we'll figure out a way to--
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.200]   we'll stream the thing without commentary
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.760]   and then do a show after or something like that.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   We'll figure out a way to do it.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.120]   But if you're out there, be fun.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.440]   We could do it from the Sam of Art T lounge.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440]   That's right above there.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.280]   You're feeling somewhere right there.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.760]   Kevin Rose will show up.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.880]   That'll be great.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.960]   And maybe even Ashton Kutcher.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.280]   You never know.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.760]   The truth is now that South By and events like that
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.320]   and CES are really dominated by real celebrities
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.360]   and CNN had the CNN grill and the bald guy interviewing
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.000]   like all the people we can never get on Twitter, he's got,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.080]   like Reed Hastings.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.680]   And so that's become mainstream.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.240]   So now it's the developer conferences
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.160]   that are really where the interest-- where the rubber
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.520]   meets the road with interesting things.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.800]   And that's interesting too because you,
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.920]   apart from the little old lady me,
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.960]   you have to have some cred to get in.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.080]   Yes.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.360]   That's true too.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.200]   Ashton Kutcher can do that.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.520]   Which makes it better.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.400]   Ashton might not get an invite.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.680]   And Vic, please don't invite him because it's
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.080]   a spoiler for us.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.400]   Google is going to do its own way.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.360]   They've said this all along.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.720]   Eric Schmidt said it a year ago.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.800]   Its own branded tablet.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.200]   According to digit times, it will be made by Asus
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.120]   and could be coming by May just in time for Google I/O.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:56.920]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.480]   Giveaways.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   Yeah, this could be a giveaway.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.400]   I'm a little sad that this seems more like a Kindle
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.600]   competitor than a--
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.840]   It's pretty low end.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.440]   Yeah, I mean, 7-inch.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.320]   It looks like an e-reader more than a phalan tablet.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.760]   What's the price point?
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.200]   $199 to--
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.320]   $249.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:13.840]   $249.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:19.600]   Tegra 3, which is a quad core processor, $1280 by $800.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.000]   That's pretty high resolution.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.080]   And a $250 price point would be pretty competitive.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.640]   Asus showed off something similar called the MIMO at CES.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.160]   Do you think they want to use it as a media platform,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.600]   e-reader?
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.160]   What do you think?
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.320]   I think partly this is because the Kindle drives Google
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.040]   crazy because it is Android.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.680]   But at no point does Amazon ever say that or say Google.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.840]   And so this could be the Google Play tablet, right?
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.080]   Oh, play.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.600]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.080]   That's why Amazon.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:49.760]   Right.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   That's why Amazon is the target.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.720]   I get it now.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.240]   It'll be the--
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.040]   It'll be the long run.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   All right, here's the question.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.960]   Even though Apple is by far the most viable company,
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.560]   the world and all that, when it comes to Google's supposedly
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:08.520]   bad entertainment strategy, we have a story about that today,
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.840]   who should Google be going after?
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.960]   Amazon or Apple?
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.880]   Well, I think--
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.320]   call me a pie-eyed optimist.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.840]   I didn't get any of my eye yet.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.840]   But I think that Google should not go after anybody,
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.520]   but instead just try to make the best damn stuff it can.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.760]   And I think that where these companies go wrong
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.840]   is when they start looking over their shoulder
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.960]   and saying, oh, Facebook, Facebook, we've
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.880]   got to have a strategy.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.080]   We've got to do something.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:32.960]   We need to face--
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.440]   that's where you make a big mistake.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.520]   I don't think Apple ever-- this is where Steve Jobs was quite
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:37.760]   brilliant.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.920]   He was aware of the competition, but he did not design his
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.800]   products as a response to anything.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.560]   He wanted to lead the pack.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.640]   And I think if Larry is going to go wrong at Google,
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.680]   it's going to be because he says, what's Facebook doing?
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.200]   Yeah, what's--
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.080]   So this leads us, does it not to the farewell letter
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.040]   from the employee today?
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:54.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.120]   It does.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.720]   Is that what he accused them of?
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.520]   Yeah, kind of losing there.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.960]   It was a great day for farewell letters, because there
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.120]   was farewell Google, farewell Goldman Sachs,
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.920]   and farewell the empire.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.440]   I love the Darth Vader farewell to the empire.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.040]   And he bowed to one around the Yahoo and the patents, too.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.440]   So there's three today.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.400]   That was a great piece.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.600]   That was a great, great piece.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.320]   That was a great piece.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.040]   So where did we start?
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.400]   So start with the Google farewell life.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.200]   Which was posted on a Microsoft blog, an MSDN blog.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.280]   Because he got a job at MSDN, right?
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.440]   Because he works at Microsoft now, right?
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.920]   So quite a few people kind of brought that up
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.640]   when I posted.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.880]   But go ahead, Jeff.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.040]   No, I think it was somebody saying that in his view,
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.080]   Google became an advertising company.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.800]   Well, it came off a little bit naive to me.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   And Google has always been an advertising company.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.240]   We've complained on the show about Google's lack of focus.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.680]   And, gee, the good old days when we could just
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.400]   do kind of research for research and we had 20% time,
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.080]   it sounded like a farewell to Bell Labs.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.280]   And I understand every emotion that was in there, absolutely.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.640]   But as a Google shareholder, I'm not sure I wasn't happy
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.440]   to read this letter.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   This is James Whittaker, who is, according to his bio,
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.680]   a technology executive focused on making the web a better
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.320]   place for users and developers.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.640]   A former Googler, former professor, former startup,
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.080]   founder.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.760]   And the quote is the-- the pull quote.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.720]   The Google I was passionate about
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.600]   was a technology company that empowered
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.240]   its employees to innovate.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.880]   The Google I left was an advertising company
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.000]   with a single corporate mandated focus.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.520]   Is he talking about that word social?
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.800]   Yeah, he's talking about advertising via social.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.720]   Yeah, and Google+ gets thrown on and he doesn't like it.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.160]   It's a search company by God.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.680]   I've seen this kind of attitude from newspaper people
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.880]   when the digital people came in.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.840]   This is the great irony.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.640]   Oh, it's not like it used to be a change to the place.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.720]   Well, life has changed, man.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.600]   And again, I'm not saying he's wrong about some of the direction.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.760]   I'm not saying that I don't empathize with a lot of the emotions
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.520]   of saying that Google was an incredible place to be.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.880]   But reality checks.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.240]   Nothing can stay that way.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.720]   I mean, of course, it's kind of a given
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.600]   that a company isn't going to stay as it was in the early days,
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.800]   and especially if that company is successful.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.080]   Well, didn't the executives mandate
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.800]   that the solution to Facebook be shoved down
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.760]   everybody's throats?
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   They did.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.280]   They said you will get a financial reward.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.920]   Your bonus depends on your success in social.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.440]   And if not, flogging's at six.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.120]   Until attitude's improved.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.680]   So with that mindset, you have to do this.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.080]   And your 20% time, your 10% time, not as important,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   perhaps, making this focus.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.480]   Well, somebody spent their 20% on that silly machine.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:49.320]   But other than that, you know, it's
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.440]   whenever somebody writes a farewell letter to their company,
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.560]   you know, it's always kind of a mixed mat bag.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.880]   You know, somebody made this decision to leave.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.320]   So they're bitter or whatever.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.680]   You know, of course, they're not happy.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.720]   That's why they left.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.040]   Right.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.880]   Yeah, I mean, if, you know what I read this,
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.360]   I felt kind of sad about it.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.840]   We talked a few episodes ago about whether or not
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.320]   Google is worthy of our--
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.360]   is as worthy of our love and trust as it used to be.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:13.960]   That's the question.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.880]   We've deviated this question a lot here.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.800]   I mean, this guy left Google and went to Microsoft.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.680]   He started a new blog.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.640]   There's the only post on his blog.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.000]   It seems a little bit kind of like slamming, you know,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.560]   his former employer, which makes me kind of question things.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.040]   Right.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.840]   Not that he was slamming them.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.840]   But, you know, this is--
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.920]   No, but it does--
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.640]   you know, the whole point of an email like this is,
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.880]   well, let me tell you what's really going on.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.440]   And it colors that because you don't know if it is what's
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.400]   really going on or just his perception because he's leaving.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:41.400]   Right.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   Right.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.480]   I mean, sometimes, you know, sometimes you're
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.520]   at a job for a long time and the company hasn't gone bad.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.280]   You've just kind of reached your point of, you know--
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.120]   You're bitter.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.600]   Yeah, you've gone through your cycle.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.080]   Right.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.080]   But he said, you know, the old Google made a fortune on ads
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.480]   because they had good content.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.080]   It was like TV used to be.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.360]   Make the best show and you make get the most ad revenue.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.880]   TV was never like that.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.800]   But I don't know.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.360]   I could tell you right now.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.400]   Can you say the new Google sees more focused
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.080]   on the commercials themselves?
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.480]   Instead of making good shows, focus on the commercials.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.360]   I missed the days of Gilligan's Island, I got to tell you.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.920]   Yeah, so you don't want to be a small startup, right?
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.680]   Microsoft?
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.880]   By the way--
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.360]   I expect James Wicker to write a--
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.400]   Microsoft is not the company it used to be in about a year.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.520]   Because I can tell him.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.560]   Of all companies to go to.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.640]   You know, Gina, I think you're way
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.120]   on to something there, as always.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.320]   The peanut-- the favorite peanut butter
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.800]   memo about Yahoo.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.440]   Spreading itself too thin.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:36.720]   Right.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.480]   And all that was by someone who was in the inside
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.880]   and stayed on the inside because he cared about the company
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.360]   and wanted to write the company.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.640]   And was right.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.240]   And was right.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.280]   And all of that, right?
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.880]   And so I think that's a key difference.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.960]   That's somebody who cares about the company who's saying,
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.560]   I'm going to be just with tough love here.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.720]   And I can get in trouble for it.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.160]   But by God, I believe in this.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.520]   And I have a lot more respect for that than somebody who says,
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   I'm gone and everybody should leave with me.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.040]   And I've been there.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.920]   I've left jobs and wished that everybody
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.520]   would leave with me just to prove how right I am.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.840]   But companies go on.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.520]   Life goes on.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.000]   Yeah, I'll just write a little bit like the diary of sort
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.240]   of a naive startup employee.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:13.760]   Yes.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.200]   My first job, my first startup job, my first dot com job.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.040]   I was 23.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.920]   And it was the first boom.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.960]   And I drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.480]   And we were revolutionizing the web.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.200]   And we were making a social network for teenagers,
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.120]   which didn't make it.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.440]   This was pre-Facebook.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.840]   And when the first round of layoffs happened,
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.240]   it just hit everybody.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.920]   Because it's like, we're part of this family.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.120]   And we're part of this movement.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.120]   We're doing something bigger than--
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.560]   This isn't a company.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.080]   Right.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:36.720]   This isn't a company.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.160]   You're treating it like a company.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.480]   We're just a family full of hipsters changing the world here.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.280]   What do you mean it's a profit deal?
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.680]   Right, exactly.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.400]   I mean, right.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.920]   So it kind of felt like that to me.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.120]   That's what I had my-- now I was 23.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.520]   Right.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.360]   This person has been in business for much longer.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.920]   So he had read a little bit like that,
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.400]   that rude awakening of like, oh, this is for profit.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:50:59.900]   All right.
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.720]   Well, let's look at this one.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.680]   This is Greg Sandoval writing for a CNET.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.040]   Google's entertainment strategy is in disarray.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.760]   Google Music no longer exists as a standalone service.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.440]   Google TV was an embarrassment.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.120]   YouTube may lose music videos next year.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.200]   He's talking about Vivo pulling out.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.400]   Sources say not everybody at YouTube and Android
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.160]   is pulling in the same direction.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.120]   I have to admit this play thing through the--
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.120]   I mean, play books, play apps.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.080]   I don't understand.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.560]   It really deprecated the app store.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.200]   It confused the hell out of me.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.920]   I don't like that new Google play.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.560]   And I think the strategy does look-- it doesn't look elegant.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:43.600]   It really looks like a me too.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:48.720]   Like, oh, quick, do something.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.960]   It doesn't look strategized.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   It doesn't look thought out at all.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.440]   So you feel like play is Google trying to catch up
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.520]   with Amazon and Google+ is Google trying to catch up with Facebook.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.640]   And you just feel like they're just kind of imitating.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.400]   It's imitative.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.600]   And so that is the criticism I would say.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.000]   Yeah, Google's an advertising company.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.080]   They always have been.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.760]   But they've also been famous for being the smartest guys
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.800]   in the game.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.520]   More PhDs than anybody else.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.280]   Innovators, brilliant, clever, Gmail,
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.920]   maps, even wave, you could argue.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.440]   But Gmail and maps, those were products that were around.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.480]   I mean, MapQuest had the market.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.640]   You know, Docker mail and Hotmail were web-based email.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.400]   We all thought that just the idea of web-based email was amazing.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.560]   Then Gmail launches and it's just like, oh,
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.040]   you know, this idea of unlimited storage.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.000]   They did it better.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.160]   They did it much better.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.000]   It's such a self.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.240]   Right?
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:35.760]   That's right.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.240]   All was there.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.440]   All the VISTA was there.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.120]   That's a good point.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.520]   So OK, maybe not innovators, but still smart, right?
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.360]   They did it better.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.000]   And that's what Apple did, by the way.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.720]   They weren't the first of anything.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.480]   They just made it better.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:46.880]   Right.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.160]   Right.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.560]   And so the key thing that they're not doing right now
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.720]   is maybe not making it better.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.560]   All right.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.280]   So copying Facebook isn't wrong.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.240]   Just making it better than Facebook.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:56.680]   Right.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.640]   I talked to somebody this week about Gutenberg.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.280]   Sorry.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.000]   Drake, everybody Drake.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.520]   Moment.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.280]   And the guy.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.920]   Can I eat pie instead?
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.640]   The guy who invested in the turnovers business
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.240]   named me, Oh, Johann Foust.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.600]   And his great line was, you have to ask yourself,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.040]   you want to be first or Foust?
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:17.840]   We're second to credit.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:22.800]   I guess it's an extremely obscure joke, but I like it.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.480]   First, you have to say, you know, by the way,
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.400]   the guy who took over was Foust.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.320]   Yeah, you know it's all sorry.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.480]   Now, here's the joke.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.960]   I Uber geeked.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.400]   No, it's good.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:33.760]   It's good.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.400]   I want everybody to tweet that joke.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.040]   And act as if you don't get it.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.480]   You did know that Foust was the guy who took over
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   the business, right?
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:46.880]   The Google is doing some smart things with Play.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.200]   The 25 cent movies, 25 cent books.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.480]   It certainly draws people in.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.320]   I think this is like Amazon's giving away free app a day.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.680]   But Amazon is countering and doing the same thing
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.040]   with the same exact media.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:03.400]   It's kind of hard to beat Amazon at the merchandising game.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.040]   Well, Google just needs people to set up their Google Wallet
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:06.400]   account.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.920]   They just need for people to take that dot and make it easy
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.080]   to pay.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.000]   That's a good point.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.240]   Everyone's got that set up with Amazon already.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.600]   And Google's right to be threatened.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.160]   I mean, in Vivo leaving YouTube, Vivo was the music label
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.120]   set up a kind of a separate entity within YouTube
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.840]   for Lady Gaga's videos and all the other videos
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.360]   and drives millions of views every week.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.160]   They're going to maybe going to Facebook.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.000]   So Google is right to be threatened by some of these
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:34.480]   platforms.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.760]   I mean, Facebook and Amazon threaten Google, don't they?
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.960]   Right, where they--
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.000]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.880]   Where the wallet hits.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.240]   Greg says Google might need a content czar.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.360]   Is that the solution?
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.040]   Isn't that what Terry Semmel was supposed to be at Yahoo?
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.960]   No, it's the exact wrong thing.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   Right.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.000]   It's supposed to be a studio.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.880]   I sat in this conference room yesterday
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.080]   with these markers from entertainment and consultancy
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.440]   and technology.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.320]   And I sat there and I thought about you, Leo,
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.120]   because I often do.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.560]   It's a little creepy, though.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.200]   OK.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.920]   OK.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:15.440]   I've known to say nice things about Leo.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.800]   And I'm really off the street.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.680]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.920]   I love it.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.040]   In fact, the main reason I want you to come out to Google I/O
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.520]   is so I can get that beer out.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.240]   So we can hug?
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   Yeah, we don't want to hug a man hug.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.360]   Yeah, man hug.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.280]   Ro hug.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.080]   Anyway, so I sat there and I thought,
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.480]   here are all the people who want to stand in between.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.240]   And today do stand in between the creator
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.080]   and their public, their market.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.120]   Their audience.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.200]   And they all think they're adding this great value.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.400]   But they're not.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:44.920]   Right.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.080]   And they're all thinking about networks and distributors
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.920]   and the technology and the this and that.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.600]   I just wanted-- I didn't because I'm a wimp
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.320]   and I was hoping I was going to get a free phone.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.440]   I wanted to scream, stop.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.920]   You're not adding value.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.280]   Middlemen don't add value.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.400]   Middlemen think they add value.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.360]   Exactly.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.920]   And if you're needed, if your channels are needed--
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.000]   and I'm saying channels aren't needed.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.720]   Well, no, OK, some of the present channels will die.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.480]   But there's still always-- you need channels.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.800]   No, you don't.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.680]   Leo, look at Leo.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.520]   And it just frustrated the hell out of me.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.160]   Because they didn't do anything about it.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.320]   I ate their free fruit.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.800]   And what?
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.560]   And now, after the fruit has been digested,
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:28.800]   you're going after them remotely.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.560]   So I'm going to do one more story.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.320]   This is a feel good story.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.960]   And then we'll get a commercial and we'll talk some more.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.120]   I'm having a great time.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.000]   I hope you weren't too.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.880]   Please, I hope you're eating some pie.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.400]   Sugar it up, Leo is sugar it up.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.800]   I am sugar it up, baby.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.440]   Jeff Jarvis is here from buzzmachine.com.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.600]   Jeremiah O'Yang from Altimeter Group.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.800]   Gina Trapani from smarterware.org.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:57.000]   The FBI stumped by a pimps Android lock.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.920]   Sir, so warrant on Google.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.520]   This is the greatest one.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.720]   In 2005, San Diego's Dante deers.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.240]   Do you know him?
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.000]   I don't.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.880]   Sentenced to state prison for founding and running
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:13.560]   a group called Pimp and Hose Daily, or PhD.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.880]   We wouldn't follow that.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.400]   It's so racist.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.960]   I just wanted to say it.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.560]   The name wasn't Braggadot's show.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.840]   It was mere description.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.560]   Before Deers pled guilty in the middle of 2005,
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.680]   one minor female testified how Deers had recruited her out
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.400]   of a homeless shelter.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.440]   He told me he was going to help take care of me
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.760]   and be there for me.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.600]   He told me what to do and how to do it.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   And said we would make money that way.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.800]   I was tired of living on the streets.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.680]   Anyway, it's a long, tearful saga.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.000]   He beat her up, blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.920]   Of course.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   She was only 15.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.440]   Sad.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:48.920]   Oh, man.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.440]   Sad.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   Yeah, he went to prison.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.280]   He got out in 2009, violated parole, three separate occasions,
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.400]   went back to jail for a year and a half.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.560]   This is not a nice guy.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:01.640]   He released May 2011, went back to the old activities,
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.680]   even though he had a GPS monitor.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:08.320]   He used a Samsung Android phone, great ad, for Samsung
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.000]   to continue pimpin' via phone.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.400]   Telephone pimpin', they call it.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.960]   The phone of power, pimpin'.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.720]   Sorry.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.120]   An FBI source met with him in his apartment in Chula Vista
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.800]   for nearly three hours during that time he watched
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.680]   Deers taking several telephone calls
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:27.040]   where he discussed the night's prostitution activities,
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.400]   sent multiple text messages.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:31.120]   Really, they do all these ads like the little girl
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.440]   who eliminates tan making a bit.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.480]   They should have this guy.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.240]   Just amazing what you can do with a Samsung phone.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.960]   They've been hosed daily.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.920]   PhD.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.040]   They used to say, don't make me--
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.200]   you don't want to fill my back hand.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.280]   Now they say, you don't want to fill my backslash.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.360]   Oh, that was bad.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.840]   So they followed him around.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.680]   You think my first joke was trying to--
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.200]   I know.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.040]   I'm just--
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.120]   This is the day of bed.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.080]   The FBI put the target under physical surveillance
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.920]   and observed him one night using the phone frequently
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.720]   for a period of nearly six hours.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.680]   Despite the fact he denied even owning a cell phone for months
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.600]   to his parole agent when confronted with the evidence,
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.640]   he said, as my sister's phone, eventually they got it.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.360]   He turned it over to the parole agent,
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.320]   but he didn't unlock it.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.200]   He didn't unlock it.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.160]   The FBI got a search warrant.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.440]   They took the parole agent.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.440]   They sent it to the FBI Regional Computer Forensics Lab.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.240]   There, technicians, quote, attempted
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.880]   to gain access to the contents of the memory
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.080]   of the cellular telephone in question,
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:33.600]   but were unable to do so because Android's pattern lock.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600]   A little--
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.440]   So the FBI couldn't get through Android's pattern lock.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.280]   Well, what happened is they tried.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:41.440]   They were like monkeys.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.560]   They tried, and they locked the phone, right?
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.480]   Ten times?
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:44.840]   That's it.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.760]   You're out.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.440]   And now they needed his Google account credentials,
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.880]   and they wouldn't give it to him.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:56.160]   So they get a warrant, and they serve Google saying,
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.000]   we want the subscriber's name, address, social security,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.440]   number, account login, password, all email, personal contact
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.240]   information, facility or phone, time and duration
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.040]   of every web page visited, all text messages sent and received
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.800]   from the phone, including photo and video messages.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.480]   This is from Google.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.200]   I don't know why Google would know some of this.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.800]   Any email addresses or instant message
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.000]   your accounts used on the phone, verbal and/or written
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.360]   instructions for overriding the pattern lock
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.280]   installed on the phone, all search terms internet history
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.800]   and GPS data that Google has stored for the phone.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.080]   Now, the FBI can't get that from the networks.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.120]   Well, they have to go through Google.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.160]   And there's no reason why Google should have his social security
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   number unless he is a developer accepting payment
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160]   through the Android one.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:41.200]   It's actually stunning that this FBI regional computer
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.600]   forensics lab--
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.400]   Yeah, that scares me.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.280]   Like monkeys, they go, well, let's try that.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.760]   No, that's not it.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.440]   Let's try that.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.280]   No, that's not it.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.560]   And ten times later, the phone locks.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.000]   So it must be iPhone use.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.600]   It's from kind of encryption secrecy.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.680]   No, no, Google's in trouble.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.760]   They're just subpoenaed.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.960]   Google says, like all law-abiding companies,
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.360]   we comply with valid legal processes.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.560]   However, whenever we receive requests like this,
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.160]   we make sure it meets both the letter and spirit
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.720]   of the law before complying.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.600]   And if we believe a request is overly broad,
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.040]   we'll seek to narrow it.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   So I guess they'll go back to court and say, hey, dude,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   we'll give you the password.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.440]   But what do you want here?
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:27.880]   A US judge-- so there was some debate over whether that phone--
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.240]   since it was still operating, that
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.160]   would have been a wiretap.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.680]   Well, yeah, there's a privacy issue.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.120]   So some people said, well, they should really
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.520]   get a wiretap order.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.880]   But a judge disagreed, and he said, no, it's a search warrant.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.000]   And go ahead.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.360]   So unknown, what will happen.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.880]   But that's an interesting--
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.400]   but just you know what, the bottom-- the takeaway,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.240]   is that pattern is pretty good.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.320]   That works.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.560]   I know, I got to set that up.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.360]   I've been kind of lazy about it.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.040]   I use it.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.360]   I always-- de Vorek always thought,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.520]   because he'd say, well, I could just tell the smudges.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.760]   I could see what your pattern is.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.920]   So make sure you clean your screen.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.280]   That's all.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:04.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.720]   Make sure that--
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.800]   That guy had clean hands.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.560]   Clean hands.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.880]   Pimp and hose daily.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.520]   It's a silly story, but I just-- that couldn't resist.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.840]   We're going to take a break, come back
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.680]   with more with Jeremiah, Gina, and Jeff.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.240]   It's the j-- j-- j-- show.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.000]   My name is Geo.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.280]   Jeremiah, I like that.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.440]   It's got a little-- a certain alliteration.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.000]   Jeremiah, Gina, and Jeff.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.200]   The show brought to you by our friends at Carbonite,
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   online, backup.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.640]   You know, I mean, if we're talking about the cloud,
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.040]   you know the cloud is great for backup, right?
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.360]   If you were going to use a backup service with the cloud,
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.520]   what would you want?
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.680]   It should be automatic.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.000]   You shouldn't have to think about it.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.800]   Continuous whenever you're online, right?
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.160]   Encrypted.
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.960]   In two ways, SSL, of course, so that you could be using it
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.480]   in an open access spot and it would be completely safe, right?
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.640]   But you should also be able to encrypt it using your own keys,
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.000]   yes.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.520]   And it should be unlimited for an affordable price.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.720]   Could you-- is it possible?
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.280]   Could it-- is there anybody who could do that?
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.520]   Yes, Carbonite, automatic, continuous,
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.040]   unlimited, less than $5 a month for everything
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.320]   on your internal drive.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.960]   You want to use external drives, multiple computers.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.080]   You've got plans for that, also very reasonable.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.800]   Encrypted with SSL, and you hold the key
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.280]   for the public key cryptography.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.280]   If you want to further encrypt it, they'll do it for you
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.160]   and you hold the key.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.280]   No judge can get it.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.320]   No order.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.240]   It's secure.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.600]   So if you're pimping hoes daily, this--
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.320]   is this-- no, I'm just joking--
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.160]   carbonite.com.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.680]   Right now, if you try it for free,
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.960]   you just need the offer code twig.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.320]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.640]   Just the offer code twig.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   Try it for 15 days.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.560]   If you decide you like it, $59 a month,
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.280]   less than $5 a month, and you'll get 14 months for the price
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.800]   of 12, so you get two free months.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:55.600]   But you have to use the offer code twig for this week in Google.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.680]   These guys know how to do it.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.800]   They really do it, right?
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.680]   I was actually talking to David from the CEO,
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.680]   and he said, we get subpoenas sometimes
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.720]   from law enforcement.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.680]   And we got a subpoena the other day,
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.360]   and we said, we don't have the key.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.760]   It's encrypted.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.120]   Supina, all you want, you got to ask the guy,
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.200]   because we don't have the key.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.000]   And I like that.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.520]   That's what you're looking for, right?
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.720]   He's going to get a flood of Pimson-Hose.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.600]   No, you know what?
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.520]   You know what the issue is?
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.520]   And this is what came up with Dropbox is.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.440]   Well, if the company has the key,
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.400]   then a rogue employee could presumably look at your data.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.040]   So you don't want the company to have the key.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.720]   It's not about avoiding law enforcement.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.680]   Sorry, that was not a good addition to a company.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.680]   No, I started it.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.120]   I started it.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.360]   It's not for doing illegal things with--
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.920]   it's the point being that your privacy is protected,
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.320]   even at the company.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.040]   FTC is seeking Apple's testimonial.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:49.960]   This is good.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.480]   In the Google antitrust probe.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   That's a silly, isn't it?
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.320]   Probe, yeah.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.480]   I wonder what Apple thinks.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.960]   (laughing)
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.640]   Do you think Apple has an opinion about Google?
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.600]   Let's hold Google up and you can punch him in the stomach.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.520]   Hey, Jeremiah, we need you along with the flashlight.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.360]   Let's stop this fight.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.200]   (laughing)
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.560]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.520]   This goes back to the,
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.360]   not the thing that actually would be relevant,
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.680]   which is Google's use of an iframed,
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.240]   hidden form to get around the third party cookie thing.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   This has to do with the default search engine on the iPhone.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.600]   They've subpoenaed Apple in hopes of getting details
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.560]   about its mobile search deal with Google.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.880]   Information on the agreement, if any,
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.720]   that has made Google the default search engine
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.520]   on the iPhone, iPad, and iPad.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.640]   Yeah, Apple, why didn't you use Bing?
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.360]   Yeah, why did you do that, Apple?
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.760]   Did Google give you money?
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.640]   Well, you know, Safari, the default,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.920]   as I was looking, is also Google too.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.400]   So I don't understand how this is any different.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.760]   Well, I guess it's reasonable to ask,
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.280]   did Google make a side deal with you?
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.040]   It's not illegal, by the way, to do that, right?
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.600]   I mean, it happens all the time.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.200]   And in fact, what they should probably be asking,
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.040]   I don't know if I should help them,
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.000]   but what they should probably be asking is,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.880]   do you make money off of using Google
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.920]   as your default search engine?
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.720]   Because the answer to that is yes.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.080]   Was it a deal or not?
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.000]   Firefox is like the biggest revenue generator.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.640]   That's what keeps Mozilla alive.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.240]   It's millions a year.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.560]   I didn't ask that.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.000]   The subpoena, which Apple did not confirm or comment,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.760]   is part of a larger investigation by the FTC
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.800]   to figure out whether Google has used unfair
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.900]   or deceptive business practices.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:38.120]   It sounded like a phishing expedition to me.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:38.960]   Boy, does it ever.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.120]   India, not happy about Google either.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.760]   Sensorship.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.440]   That rear's a thing.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.280]   Yes, exactly.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:55.240]   Both Facebook and Google are on trial in India
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.200]   over not censoring.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.280]   Right.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.480]   Things that are considered indecent.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.720]   And there was a recent law that was kind of pulled back there,
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.120]   but it threatens to get bad.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.200]   It's the ongoing fight against the free internet, folks.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.960]   It's interesting, 'cause this is actually a lawsuit
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   by an Indian journalist, a criminal complaint
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.520]   against Google, Facebook and 10 other firms
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.080]   saying their lack of censorship will corrupt minds.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.720]   Wow.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.640]   It's just a different, you know, it's maybe it's cultural.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.480]   I don't know.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.760]   No, no, I'm not gonna buy that.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.840]   I'm sorry, I'm not gonna buy that.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.840]   That's the controlling thing from people who want to stop you
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.400]   from thinking the way you want to think.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.600]   And that's universal.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.920]   Google and Facebook both say, "We will block content,
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.040]   but you have to notify us of infringement.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.120]   We'll do it for copyright reasons."
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.000]   India has an information technology law,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.960]   which these companies claim protects them
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.760]   against content added to sites by users.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.680]   I would guess it's a safe harbor kind of a provision
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.920]   like our DMCA.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.960]   We saw the same thing in China with Google and Yahoo.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.800]   Just a few years ago.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.640]   But they caved.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.600]   Actually, they didn't caved.
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.960]   Well, there was a lot of pressure.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960]   They got out.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.480]   They said, "See you later."
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:14.800]   What do you think about this Yahoo Facebook lawsuit?
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.120]   Tell me about this one.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.200]   Oh, you don't know about this?
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   Oh, oh, oh, you're talking about the patents on Andy Bio.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.640]   Yahoo says, "We invented social networking."
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.200]   So if you read Andy's post, which I think was very clever,
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.000]   he also stated that this was done during a quiet period
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.560]   before IPO, so it was a strategic time to raise scrutiny.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.960]   Facebook's IPO.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:35.760]   Mm.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.520]   So they are sitting on this waiting for it.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520]   Mm.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.200]   So that's even sleazier.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.760]   That's like exactly.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.920]   We could tank this deal.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:50.600]   Well, you read the piece, the notion of being weaponized,
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.680]   the patents being weaponized, is just a great one.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.520]   That's great title.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.520]   That's great copy.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.480]   It's a great headline.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.320]   It's a great story.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.680]   And Andy's my coworker and expert lab.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.280]   He did such a great job on this piece.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.960]   I mean, he's basically saying that his company upcoming
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.920]   was acquired by Yahoo.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.320]   Three-person startup.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.600]   And he gets to Yahoo.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.760]   And they say that they kind of sit down
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.040]   all kind of the new acquisitions, the new people on the team
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.240]   and say, "Hey, we want you to file patents.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.920]   "We want to do this because we'll use them defensively.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.680]   "We want you to kind of own your work
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   "and it's good for the company
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.000]   "and we'll give you a little bonus if you do so."
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.600]   And so he's kind of a new Yahoo employee
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.160]   and he says, "Sure, okay."
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.160]   So he files--
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.360]   This was upcoming.org was his company.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.960]   Upcoming.org was his, yeah.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.800]   Great service.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.640]   I loved it.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.160]   I'm so sad that Yahoo just clobbered it.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.960]   He does so and the patents have his name on them
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.320]   and now they're being used not defensively
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.840]   the way that he was told they would be used,
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.760]   but offensively.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.240]   And he said, "I'm embarrassed.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.680]   "I'm embarrassed that these parents have patents
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.640]   "have my name on them.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.160]   "They're being used in a way
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.360]   "that I was told that they wouldn't be used
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.440]   "and I will never," he went as far as to say,
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.280]   "I will never file another patent again."
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.640]   Yahoo had a patent incentive program with sizable bonuses
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.040]   if you patented the work that you had done at the company.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.480]   Even if you didn't do it at Yahoo,
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.240]   all these upcoming patents were when
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.200]   upcoming wasn't yet acquired.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.360]   I was fantasizing wondering whether Andy had a suit
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.880]   against Yahoo for fraud, fraudulent.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.720]   Oh, interesting.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.360]   Acquisition of his patent.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.640]   They promised him the patent that he would only be used
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.480]   in this one way.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.360]   They used patents in an all in a different way.
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.920]   Of course, the problem is his own patent
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.600]   wasn't part of his fight against.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.240]   No, but he did file, I think he said eight.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.240]   He said, "I was naive even if the original intent
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.920]   "was truly defensive," and this is an important point,
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.960]   to a patent portfolio can easily change hands.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.080]   And a company can even more easily change its mind.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.680]   Since I left in 2007, Yahoo's had three CEOs
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.880]   and a board overhaul.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.720]   So it may be that the intent was at the time,
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.160]   this is just defensive, and in fact, it's good business.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.000]   You know what?
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.760]   I think you could say, "I should probably do."
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.040]   It's good business.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.040]   We should have patents on this stuff.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.920]   Not 'cause we're gonna sue anybody, but defensively.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.920]   It's just good business, but the problem is,
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.440]   and Andy points us out, there's no guarantee
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.000]   it's gonna stay defensive.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.080]   - Now, look at what's talking about this.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.120]   What patents could, could, could, quit file?
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   - Oh, I think there's probably quite a few process patents
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.880]   we could go after in our workflow and stuff.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.440]   DeVorack always told me, he said,
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.240]   "The value in your company, it's not the value,
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.040]   "it's not the content, the value's not the people.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.080]   "The value is in the workflow."
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.760]   He said, "If you sell this company,
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.000]   "if you make any money on this company,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.480]   "it will be because you figure out a way to do ABCD
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.400]   "in such a way that a company like CBS or somebody
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.520]   "would wanna buy."
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.560]   And so he always said, "Patton at all."
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.760]   I'm not into it for money, I'm just here to have a good time.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.880]   - And he, and he, and he,
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.760]   you're into it for the pie.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.760]   - I'm into it for the pie.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.320]   I feel so sorry for Andy, 'cause he's a great guy,
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.080]   and I think he's absolutely right.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.600]   - Yeah, it was a well done piece and like a sucks.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.640]   - Glad he wrote that.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.480]   Glad he wrote that.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.560]   - He really got it.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.280]   So Leo, you wouldn't patent it then, your workflow would switch.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   - Well, I'm with Andy when he says, he says, "Patton,
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.360]   "this is, these are bad.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.480]   "Ask any programmer, developing software
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.680]   "as his creative and unique as writing poetry.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.480]   "Yahoo's lawsuit against Facebook is an insult
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.360]   "to the talented engineers who filed patents
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.560]   "with the understanding they wouldn't be used for evil.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.160]   "I'm embarrassed by the patents I filed by,
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.080]   "but I've learned from my mistake.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.160]   "I'll never, as you said,
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.120]   "I'll never file a software patent again,
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.800]   "and I urge you to do the same."
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.640]   - Hmm, that's--
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.200]   - He's very defensive.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200]   - Argument for you.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.040]   - Well, that's what I'm saying is,
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.400]   it could very well be that Yahoo did have all the best intentions
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.280]   when this patent incentive program was created,
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.800]   and it is good business.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.560]   You cannot deny, it's good business.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.320]   If the, look, if you don't like software patents,
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.880]   change the law, but the law is the way it is,
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.600]   and in every business has a fiduciary responsibility
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.280]   to stakeholders to act within the law in its best interest.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.680]   So if we have patent law, I mean, this, by the way,
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.960]   this is me arguing that, 'cause I don't believe this,
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.880]   'cause I wouldn't do it just 'cause I don't wanna be evil,
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.440]   but it's perfectly legitimate for a company act,
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.760]   especially a publicly held company like Yahoo,
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.120]   they have a fiduciary responsibility to act
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.080]   in their best interest in accordance with the law.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.320]   So the problem is the law.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.280]   Not Yahoo, although I'm sad that Yahoo's suing Facebook.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.920]   - Well, there is a problem here with Yahoo's behavior.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.640]   Yahoo didn't have to do this.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.600]   Yahoo didn't have to do this at this time.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.080]   This is sleazy and evil.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.400]   So I would say that, yeah, you know,
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.960]   my joke about this was that Yahoo finally found
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.040]   a business model.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.960]   - And it's kind of sad.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.920]   - Yahoo 360 didn't pan out.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.840]   - Yeah.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.360]   Such a shame.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.080]   - Yeah, 360, wow.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   - I score that. - I got that.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.000]   - I don't know that awhile.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.160]   - Fire Eagle.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.480]   - And waiting for the Wiggle Vi to join the board.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.720]   (laughing)
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.560]   - It is.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.080]   - I think there's a new verb.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:55.920]   They're Winkle Vi. - You know what?
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.160]   - They're Winkle Vi. - But who's bored?
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.040]   - This is, we have to create a new word.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.320]   If you can't innovate, Winkle Vi.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.600]   - Oh, I like that. - Yeah.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.200]   Those who don't innovate, Winkle Vi.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.480]   I like it.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:12.640]   (humming)
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.600]   I think we've done everything.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.600]   We haven't, you mentioned it,
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.920]   but we probably should read Darth Vader's parody.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.480]   His goodbye to the Empire.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.320]   Let me see. - We have to give
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.160]   the context first.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.880]   You have to, maybe Jeff can talk about
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.560]   the Goldman Sachs man thing.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.400]   - There was another one.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.240]   So we talked about the Google one.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.880]   There's a Goldman Sachs one.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.440]   - By the way, the coach of the Knicks just issued
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.680]   his farewell of why he's leaving the Knicks.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.520]   - Wow.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.560]   - 'Cause he didn't capitalize on the insanity.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.880]   And now we have a Goldman Sachs executive
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.640]   who said that Goldman Sachs had lost
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.160]   all its culture of decency.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.320]   The tone in a lot of ways is somewhat similar
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.960]   to the Google letter, but I think I'm probably more
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.600]   sympathetic to the Goldman Sachs guy doing it.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.760]   Though, by the way, it was filled with some obnoxious
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.920]   egotistical things about how he was a ping pong
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.360]   chapping in and other stuff.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.200]   - Jesus.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.640]   I am master of the universe.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:06.360]   - But anyway, so he wrote this letter
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.480]   and it appeared as an op-ed in the New York Times.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.400]   And Goldman Sachs stock went down.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.400]   It's been the-- - Wow.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.040]   - It's in the cards. - Twitter and the whole world.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.680]   - That hurts. - And you know, at a time
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.840]   when we think the Goldman Sachs and other banks
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.440]   are pretty damned evil, it's truly preaching to the choir.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:29.440]   So it's in that context that God's made her leaves.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.440]   - I can't, you know, for some reason it's not coming up.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.480]   It's a, you can read it, folks.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.560]   It's at thedailymash.co.uk.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.040]   And I don't know if the site's down here.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.400]   - Did you read the Goldman Sachs response?
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.080]   - No. - Yeah, so they responded.
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.880]   And it's interesting, the response,
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.040]   it was very cleverly crafted through Corpcom, obviously.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.720]   But they didn't mention the person's name.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.680]   We do not appreciate people talking on behalf
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.800]   of the 30,000 of us who are very ethical.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.640]   - Oh, I like that. - Yeah, so good response.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.760]   - That was a pretty lengthy response that was well written.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.400]   But it was still a little bit late.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.240]   You know, this thing blew up pretty big.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.640]   So the question is, and I look to hear
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.680]   Jeff Njino's thoughts is, are we gonna see this
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.080]   every time we change a job?
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.000]   Everybody's gonna go submit to Mashable?
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.600]   - Yeah, really. - Right, I'm changing jobs.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.680]   - I think you cannot beat Stewart Butterfield's
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.000]   great departure from-- - No, that is true.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.920]   That's a classic. - That's the way
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.160]   to do a farewell letter.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.520]   - Stewart was one of the founders of Flickr.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.000]   And I do remember that letter.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.440]   It was funny, wasn't it?
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.160]   - I just looked it up to darn it.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   - Let me see if I can find it.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.000]   - I don't remember.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.200]   - If you look up a Stewart Butterfield--
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.040]   - Resignation letter, here it is in Google.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.120]   Thank you, Google.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.880]   - Did he mention Tina Butter at all?
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.600]   - No, this is even better than that.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.640]   - It's tin. - Tin.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.360]   - It's all about tin.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.040]   Let me see if I can find this.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.520]   - Truthfully, I like to read,
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.840]   I like to hear the real reasons why people leave
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.200]   instead of all the platitudes,
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.320]   about wanting to spend more time with family.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.800]   - Yeah, it's better than that.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.280]   - I like it, I mean, I don't know.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.320]   - He writes to Brad Garlinghouse,
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.040]   who I guess was probably some executive at Yale.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.880]   Dear Brad, as you know, tin is in my blood.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.200]   For generations, my family has worked
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.920]   with this most useful of metals.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.560]   When I joined Yahoo back in '21,
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.600]   it was a sheet tin concern of great momentum,
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.440]   growth and innovation.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.880]   I knew it was the place for me over the decades
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.200]   as the company grew and expanded first into dyes
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.040]   and bunches, into copper, corrugated,
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.800]   steel synthesized rubber, piping, milling equipment,
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.240]   engines, instruments, weaponry, and so on.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.120]   I still felt at home because tin was at the core
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.000]   of the business.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.080]   After the wars, we continued to branch out
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.120]   in electronics, all manner of aeronautical frames,
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.680]   hulls, bodies, computing, tabulating machines,
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.840]   precision controls, and later real estate brewing,
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.680]   consumer finance, grain processing,
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.000]   lighting and salty snacks.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.360]   I took it in stride.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.480]   Further still was a place for me.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.080]   Since the late '80s, as the general manufacturing oil
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.440]   exploration, refining logistics and hotel and casino
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.440]   divisions rose to prominence, I felt somewhat sidelined.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.800]   By the time of the internet revolution
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.120]   and our expansion into websites, I have been cast adrift.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.520]   I tried to roll with the times, but Nary, a sheet of tin,
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.200]   has rolled out of our own production lines
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.520]   in over 30 years.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.600]   So please--
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.000]   - Now that's the way to say goodbyes.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.840]   - Yeah.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:10.680]   (laughing)
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.000]   - Nary, a sheet of tin.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:12.880]   - Nary, a sheet of--
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.480]   please accept my resignation.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.080]   And now I don't need to know fancy parties or gold watches.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   I still have the one from '61 and '76.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.520]   I'll be spending more time with my family,
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.920]   tending to my small but growing alpaca herd.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.000]   (laughing)
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.120]   And of course, getting back to work with tin,
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.280]   my first love.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.000]   What has Stewart done since it?
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.160]   Kind of, Rina's been very active.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.000]   I don't know if Stewart's--
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:34.840]   - Yeah, Rina, yeah.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.480]   I don't know what he's been doing, actually.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.920]   - See, that's a safe way to exit.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.920]   The way that some other folks are exiting,
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.960]   I think could hurt their employment option.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.240]   You don't wanna really be the disgruntled.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.520]   Nobody hires a disgruntled employee.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.960]   - You know, I always done blog posts
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.360]   when I'm exiting my company spot.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.160]   I always let my executive team review it
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.000]   before I publish it.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.120]   - Oh, that's smart.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:53.960]   That's smart.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.800]   - I wanna be gracious.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.440]   I even offered to help them find my replacement
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.360]   and my last company.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.040]   - I just slink off quietly my tail
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.920]   between my legs, my head hung in humiliation.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.600]   - With the last time you've needed a resume load.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.680]   - Actually, I don't think I ever have done that.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.440]   (laughing)
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.680]   - People like Google, but not what it's doing.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.560]   Survey says the Pew Internet project.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.400]   - Privacy comes.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400]   - Jeff has already signed.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.240]   - No.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.080]   (buzzing)
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.400]   - Jeff, it's so creepy.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.200]   (buzzing)
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.680]   (laughing)
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.520]   - They love it.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.040]   83% of search users prefer Google.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:26.880]   Look at that.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.920]   - See, that's what Apple should say.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.760]   Back to that entry.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.720]   - Let's imagine Google's answer this.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.560]   Google's answer this is very simple.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.160]   So fine, somebody asks you a question
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.520]   where there's something bothers you.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.800]   Google's gonna say, "Go with the behavior."
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.560]   The behavior speaks otherwise.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.600]   - If people didn't like Google, they wouldn't use Google.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.840]   - And yet the survey says--
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.640]   - The search, it wouldn't work.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.200]   - 73% said data mining for the purpose
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.000]   of personalizing search results is not okay.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.200]   - Okay, and how loaded can you make that question?
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.760]   - That is kind of a loaded question.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.320]   If a search engine kept track of what you search for,
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.160]   and then used that information
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.800]   to personalize your future search results,
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.160]   how would you feel about that?
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.000]   - Yeah, that's--
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.840]   - It's Google could give you better search results
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   for what you actually want.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.680]   - Right.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.040]   - Based on previous searches.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:11.880]   - Good job, bro.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.720]   - Exactly.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.800]   - Do you care about how they did it?
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.040]   - Do you want more accurate research results?
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.520]   - These guys ought to know better.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.760]   This is a reputable or--
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.520]   - We ought to force everyone to watch
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:25.520]   that magnificent, magnificent video that's on there.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.160]   I loved it, loved it, loved it.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.280]   From the search meeting, did you see that?
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.880]   - Oh yeah, let's pull that one up.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.440]   - What, what, what, what, from what's what?
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.760]   - There's a link in there.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.800]   I thought there was supposed to be wearing robes
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.640]   and having--
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.520]   - So right now I said I love this.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.360]   - Okay, I'll find it.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.680]   I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:43.520]   - Huh.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.440]   - It is a video, unprecedented video glimpse
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.560]   into Google crafts and search results
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.880]   from search engine land.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.000]   And it's eight minutes long,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:52.840]   we're obviously not gonna watch it.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.160]   - There it is, there it is.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.240]   - It is phenomenal in the detail
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.520]   that they go in for more change.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.080]   - Sausage making.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.360]   - And so this is an actual meeting at Google?
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.000]   - Yes, yes, they allowed it.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.480]   They say he says at the beginning,
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.760]   if this video isn't any good,
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.360]   and he said if I look bad, we're not putting it up.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.320]   - Can you, can you just turn up the audio briefly?
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.080]   Just kind of curious.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:15.920]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.760]   - I'm enjoying that.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.720]   That must be the elephants.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.160]   - Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.000]   - I'm sorry.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.440]   - Here, I'll do it here, I got it here.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.280]   No, wait a minute.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.320]   - And a tated blot on the screen,
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.640]   so you can figure out what's what.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:26.640]   - I think I've got it.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.720]   - This is a good place to start.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.400]   - So they're working on spelling correct.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.240]   - Right, right, right.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.560]   - Look at the size of this meeting.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.080]   - Loves, you have questions.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.760]   - Keep our latency low,
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.000]   spelling has, this guy's been distracted.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.680]   10 terms in long periods.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.520]   - He's a total poop.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.840]   - And we--
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.600]   - Isn't that Sheldon from Big Bang Theory?
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.440]   - He's the first one.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.280]   (laughing)
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.440]   - I do believe it is.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.280]   - So this is a change.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.960]   - Yo, he's a lot richer than you are.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.480]   - Who decided that we could be a little bit more
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.600]   intelligent about this,
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.520]   and so we're going to pick the two words that we think
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.560]   are most likely to be misspelled in the query,
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.960]   and form intervals of five words.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.160]   - Oh yeah, there's Mac cuts all the way
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.000]   in the left in the one.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.840]   - On the right.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:08.120]   - And this is just a smarter way of deciding
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.000]   which words to correct.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.040]   - Okay, you know what takes us a five words
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:12.920]   rather than the whole thing.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.960]   - So what's interesting is this sounds like
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.040]   this is a meeting to introduce a feature
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.720]   and they're being judged basically by--
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.920]   - They're doing quality assurance.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.760]   - I love this.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.280]   - I cannot wait to watch this.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.320]   It looks like a congressional testimony.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.760]   - Well it reminds me of the page one meeting
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.600]   of the New York Times.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.920]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:36.800]   - It's that kind of being where you're trying to prove this.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.200]   Everybody can hear their say.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.000]   And what I love about that in contrast to that stupid poll
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.400]   and a Pew is brilliant and they're wonderful
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.600]   and I love Pew but this one they got off I think,
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.560]   is that it's what you're saying to people is,
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.600]   do you want it to be better?
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.440]   Yes.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.840]   Do you really care how it's done?
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.880]   - Well, no.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.320]   If you really care, we could show you this.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.360]   We could show you how it's done with yours.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.960]   But you don't really want that, do you?
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.920]   Not really.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.560]   - This kind of transparency is what you and I
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.840]   are all about, isn't it?
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.320]   - Yes. - It's like, stop hiding.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.760]   No more smoke filled rooms.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.600]   And trust the audience to make the decision.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.640]   The problem is of course nobody does trust people
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.880]   and frankly they're probably right.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.880]   But I just think putting out this kind of video
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.320]   is exactly the right thing to do.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.600]   - Oh I think it's wonderful.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.320]   And it's just for a geek level.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.880]   It also made me say, is this one's gonna be like to go to IO?
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.280]   - No.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.640]   I wish.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.880]   You know, but wouldn't it be great if Google,
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.720]   Colleen Kelly who did all our streaming,
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.160]   I was our chief engineer for many years,
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.920]   now works at Google, is in charge of their live streaming.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.560]   She works, I think she's actually moved to the YouTube division.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.400]   Wouldn't it be great?
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.040]   Colleen, from now on, all Google meetings just broadcast them live.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.680]   Just put them on YouTube, we can watch it.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:45.840]   - Stream them all.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   - No more NDAs.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.760]   - No more NDAs.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.600]   Fresh air, transparency.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.040]   In fact, that's how government should be run,
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:53.400]   that's how businesses should be run.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.800]   No more private board meetings.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.240]   Let it all hang out, baby.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.640]   What would be, what would be,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.560]   their competitive advantage to other companies?
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.680]   Ah, screw it.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.480]   They're spying on you already anyway.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.480]   - Well, you're right.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.800]   That's exactly the point.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.880]   Would you rather be known as the company that has secrets
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:10.360]   or the company that trusts you and you have trusted?
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.880]   - Trust the user, trust your customer.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.520]   - It depends on what type of product we're talking about.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.360]   - Sure.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.320]   - Right, so if this is where Google still has
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.640]   a lot of information about us,
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.360]   so I don't want them exposing any potential security risk.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.640]   - Well, that's true.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.480]   Right?
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.320]   - That's true.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.480]   So there's security meetings could be private.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.000]   - Well, Eric Schmidt argues that Google is as transparent
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   as it can.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.120]   - Right, right.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:35.200]   - Which, I get why he's saying that it's obviously not true.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.400]   I mean, you know, does exposing how they do this
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.000]   misspelling thing allow a spammer to come in?
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.680]   God knows, spammers are clever enough, maybe,
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.520]   but I don't think so.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.760]   - And search engine marketers
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:49.440]   were dissecting that video as you over pie right now.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.760]   - We broadcast almost everything that goes on.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.920]   We have an hour, a show every week,
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.760]   a weekly show that we talk about everything,
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.520]   including finances.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.440]   They're very few private.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.880]   Yeah, they're very few private.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:00.720]   - They're finances.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.560]   - Yeah.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.320]   - There's private things that happen at Twitter.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.440]   - I want to ask what I screech really,
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.560]   what I meant to say is what's the rule?
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   Everybody goes into me knowing these are the things
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.400]   you don't know.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.040]   - No, the only rule is if somebody says,
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.040]   I don't want this broadcast, we don't do it.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:17.880]   - Oh, I see, okay.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.080]   - But my prep, my, as everybody,
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.320]   much to my chagrin here knows,
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.280]   my preference is to broadcast everything.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.840]   Most people don't want everything broadcast.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.680]   So we're working on it.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.040]   I mean, there are a lot of meanings that we have
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.280]   that I think should be broadcast,
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.200]   but you know, whenever I do interviews or whatever,
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.880]   I'd say, can I leave the cameras on?
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.280]   So we do as much, we're like Eric Schmidt.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.760]   I do as much as I can.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.600]   - And there's no competitive advantage
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.480]   to anybody knowing everything we're doing.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.840]   So when we don't turn on the camera,
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.760]   there's more about personal,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.160]   it's more about what you were talking about, Jeremy,
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.440]   protecting people's personal private lives
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.280]   and things like that.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.720]   Which always gets in my way.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.640]   I don't know why people have private lives.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.760]   (laughing)
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.440]   - People in their damn private lives.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.040]   - So yeah, we do this week in Twitter every Saturday
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.080]   at about, usually it depends right after the weekly daily
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.560]   'cause it was around four o'clock in the afternoon,
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.720]   Lisa and I and sometimes others will come by
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.120]   and we'll, and at four p.m. Pacific
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.640]   and we'll talk about what's going on at Twitter.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.360]   - What's your day off, Leo?
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.240]   - Monday and Friday.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.760]   - That's weird, Leo.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:16.920]   - I know.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:20.040]   And by the way, we take questions from the chat.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.120]   Much of that show is just people asking us
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.720]   and we respond into questions in the chat.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.600]   - Why do you take Monday off?
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.680]   Is not a big media news day?
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.160]   - I don't know.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.360]   'Cause I work so hard on the weekends.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.840]   Our big days Sunday, because our shows are most listened to
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.880]   - You're responsible then?
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.240]   - And I'm here, a mom here most every day.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.600]   This is, we're gonna end with the happy ending.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.080]   We have to have a happy ending.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.760]   Right Heaven is a copyright troll law firm
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.960]   according to Law and Disorder David Kravitz writing
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.100]   for actually for Wired.com.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:55.580]   They attempt to make money for newspapers
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.300]   by suing readers for sharing stories online.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:01.480]   (whistling)
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.820]   (laughing)
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.940]   Last Tuesday, a federal judge ordered the Las Vegas company
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:09.460]   to forfeit all of its intellectual property
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:13.100]   and other intangible property to settle its debts.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.380]   Right Heaven was formed with the idea of suing blogs
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.420]   and websites that repost newspaper articles
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.660]   without permission.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.060]   US District Judge Philip M. Pro of Nevada,
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.300]   you go Philip Pro, ordered right Heaven
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:27.300]   to surrender for auction the 278 copyright news articles
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.540]   that were the subject of its lawsuits.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.300]   They've lost the copyright.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.980]   They auctioned off the right Heaven domain for $3,000.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.240]   (laughing)
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.080]   Wow.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:45.300]   Initially this company won and settled dozens of cases
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:48.140]   as defendant bloggers paid a few thousand dollars each
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:49.740]   to make the case go away.
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.380]   Oh, I heard about this.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.660]   That's like your extortion.
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.500]   It's extortion.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:56.220]   Oh, it's the same as Pat and this is that what Yahoo
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:59.060]   is doing to Facebook folks, trolling.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.700]   And in many cases, right Heaven sought the domain names
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.900]   owned by people it was suing as payment.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.300]   But now it's lost its own domain name.
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.540]   Little old ladies who were putting up a story
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:09.300]   they found interesting in their town.
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:14.740]   It all came because a Vietnam veteran Wayne Hone
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:19.660]   successfully defended against a right Heaven copyright lawsuit.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:22.060]   They sought large damages for posting the entirety
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.300]   of a Las Vegas Review Journal editorial
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.340]   to a small online message board.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.860]   They sued him.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.380]   He fought in court and won.
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.660]   With the EFF I believe.
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:32.500]   It's great.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.340]   It's great.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.180]   Which is a good case.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.020]   And Mark granddaza.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:37.460]   Did this bloggers get their money back?
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:38.340]   No.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:39.540]   I think they're gonna fight.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:40.660]   That's what they're gonna fight over.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.940]   Yeah, that's why they're trying to liquidate their assets.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.660]   I wonder if there's any of these bloggers that we know, Jeff.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:46.660]   No.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.660]   Well, I don't know about you, but I didn't know nearly.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:50.660]   It's mostly Las Vegas.
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:54.660]   The company was funded by the Review Journal.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:58.660]   And another newspaper company called Media News came in
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:59.660]   and started using them.
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.660]   And then my friend John Payton, who's the hope
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.660]   of the newspaper industry, took over management of that company
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:07.660]   and immediately ended the deal with right Heaven.
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.660]   Awesome.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:09.660]   Nice.
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:11.660]   So happy ending.
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:12.660]   That's great.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.660]   Yeah, that's good to know.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:17.660]   Time for our tip number and tool of the week starting with Gina
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:19.660]   Trapani and your tip.
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.660]   My tip is actually it starts off as an Easter egg.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:26.660]   If you go to Google.com, you sign out and you search for
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.660]   Octal or Binary.
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:32.660]   You actually get the number of search results back in Binary
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.660]   or Octal.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.660]   Which is kind of fun.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.660]   These are different number systems.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:42.660]   And you can see I got in Octals 0053.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.660]   0053.066240 results.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.660]   Which is really fun.
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.660]   That's a fun Easter egg.
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:50.660]   Not very useful.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:53.660]   But it made me think about Google Calculator,
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.660]   which I use all the time.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.660]   You can do maths.
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.660]   You can just say two plus two equals and Google will tell you four.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.660]   But you can also do things like you can say 90,
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:03.660]   USD, and Euro.
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.660]   And it'll convert the currency for you.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:11.660]   You can say how many bytes are in 170 gigabytes?
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:15.660]   You can get all kinds of different answers for questions.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.660]   I use this when I'm cooking all the time.
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.660]   How many ounces are in a cup?
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.660]   So 10 cups in ounces.
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.660]   So this is an old tip.
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.660]   This isn't new news.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:29.660]   But the Octal hexadecimal binary Easter egg made me think of
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.660]   the calculator, which is super, super useful.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.660]   Let's see.
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:35.660]   Oh, look at all the results at Binary.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:36.660]   Yeah, nice.
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:38.660]   I've actually been using DuckDuckGo.
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:40.660]   And I really missed the calculator.
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:42.660]   And I missed this kind of thing in DuckDuckGo.
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:44.660]   It's smart for them to do things.
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:48.660]   And that spell check, by the way, is one of the simplest best things in Google.
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.660]   If you mistype it, it fixes it.
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:51.660]   It's true.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:53.660]   And I have one quick plug, Leah.
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:54.660]   I hope you don't mind.
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:55.660]   Not at all.
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:58.660]   When I went to the White House a few weeks ago and I missed the episode of Twig,
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:03.660]   actually, the reason why I was there to help plan what's called the Equal Pay App Challenge,
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:06.660]   which is the Equal Pay Task Force, the President's Equal Pay Task Force,
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:11.660]   is asking developers to build app to help narrow the wage gap between men and women,
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:12.660]   which still exists.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.660]   And I put together a site called narrowthegap.com.
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:22.660]   It's two P's, which just gives kind of some facts about the wage gap per occupation.
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:27.660]   And there's a link there for the Equal Pay App Challenge as well.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:30.660]   So any developers are interested in digging into Department of Labor data.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:33.660]   There's tons of it, and it's fascinating.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:39.660]   You can do it by gender, age, ethnicity, education level, location.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.660]   It's kind of really cool fun stuff.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:44.660]   So I put together that site real quick, and I hope you check it out,
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:47.660]   and they're accepting submissions until the end of the month.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.660]   So they're looking for smartphone apps, web apps, whatever.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:50.660]   - How cool.
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:51.660]   - Good job.
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:52.660]   - Yeah, it helped.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:53.660]   - Let me like that.
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:54.660]   Let me plus one that.
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:55.660]   - Yay.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:56.660]   - Let me pin it.
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.660]   (laughter)
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.660]   I love this.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:01.660]   - It's really nice.
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:02.660]   - I'm in love Pinterest, I hear.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:04.660]   - I hear that, yes.
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:05.660]   - I hear that.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.660]   - So, um, let's go.
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:08.660]   - Thank you.
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:11.660]   - Which occupations do women make more than men?
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.660]   Do we have any data on that?
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.660]   - Um, there, I think there was one, I think of like bill collectors.
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:20.660]   There were a few in that data set where women did make more than men on average.
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:21.660]   - Certainly not, it's been on the hose.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:22.660]   I'll tell you that right now.
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:23.660]   - So crappy jobs.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.660]   - So crappy jobs.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.660]   - So, um, what did you write this in?
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:27.660]   This is great.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:31.660]   - I wrote it in, it's PHP back in, but that's Bootstrap, developer service.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.660]   - Bootstrap developers will notice that the front end looks a lot like Twitter and Bootstrap
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:37.660]   is Twitter's kind of front end framework.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:41.660]   - I was gonna ask you, this is very cool, because this, uh, people are starting to really rave about Bootstrap.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:43.660]   - Oh, Bootstrap is fantastic.
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:50.660]   I mean, for someone like me who's a developer and completely design challenge and like the last thing I want to do is mess the CSS Bootstrap is really great.
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:56.660]   So, the front end is just Bootstrap and the back end is PHP, it's a quick framework I put together which actually powers think up.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:00.660]   - Um, so you were very, so it, Bootstrap's on GitHub and you were very able, using Bootstrap's logic.
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:05.660]   Using Bootstrap's library's tools to very quickly develop a fast goods.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.660]   By the way, I just found out Twitter is using Speedy.
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:11.660]   I wonder if you get Speedy's support as well if you do that.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.660]   Um, that's really cool.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:14.660]   - Yeah.
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.660]   - I'm meaning to ask you about Bootstrap.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:17.660]   - Yeah, it's, it's great.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:18.660]   It's really great.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.660]   Just lay out a page really nicely, very quickly.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:26.660]   I use Bootstrap and I use Google Open Web fonts and uh, yeah, that, that was basically the little Twitter widget.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:29.660]   You know, it's just kind of putting Legos together now.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.660]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.660]   - Yeah, so it's great.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.660]   So for people who don't have design sense, it's a really easy way to put together a page that looks great.
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:35.660]   - Looks great.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.660]   Very elegant.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:37.660]   Nice and clean layout.
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.660]   - Now you're starting to get some tweets too, by the way.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:40.660]   I, I want to point out.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:41.660]   - Awesome.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.660]   - That's great.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.660]   - That is great.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.660]   That is really, really neat.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:45.660]   All right.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:48.660]   narrowthegap with two P's, uh, dot com.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:51.660]   And uh, and you see the tweets are coming in.
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.660]   They're coming in.
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.660]   Uh, Jeff, you're number of the week.
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:01.660]   I'll use a few, uh, for once I had a wealth of numbers, because of course it is Pi Day.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.660]   And I would accuse you of stealing that number, but I have others.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:12.660]   Uh, one is 244, which is how many years the encyclopedia Britannica was printed until today it announced that it's no longer to be printed on paper.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.660]   Can you believe that?
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:14.660]   - Oh my God.
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:19.660]   - I said that was a, you know, a big news and I, and I tweeted about it and all the print pre-scott mad at me.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.660]   Oh, you're dancing on the grave.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.660]   No, this is good news.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:27.660]   This means that a company like that made the transition from print to become a digital company.
[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:30.660]   Now it gets $35 million a year and digital revenue has figured it out.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:31.660]   Hallelujah.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.660]   That's the world I'll be going.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:38.660]   And I also think by the way the printed encyclopedia was a huge rip off and it was sold on guilt.
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:41.660]   And so knowledge is now freed from the limits of the page.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.660]   I say celebrate.
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:44.660]   - Hallelujah.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:45.660]   Praise the number.
[01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:50.660]   - That's what the other number is, uh, two, which is the wrong number of wives to have.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.660]   And a horse.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:58.660]   Uh, uh, with, when Facebook recommended to this guy's first wife that she should friend his second wife.
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:34:59.660]   - Oh, not good.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.660]   - He wasn't divorced from either of them.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.660]   It led to a big of me complaint.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:04.660]   - Wow.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:08.660]   - And I would like that Gina did a, uh, did a plug of God's work.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:09.660]   I would like to leave.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.660]   Isn't that great?
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:16.660]   - You know, I might, I might say if you're going to have two wives you probably shouldn't mention it.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:17.660]   - Shouldn't be a Facebook.
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.660]   - Facebook.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.660]   - Don't friend them both.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:24.660]   - But, but how good for Facebook's algorithm that it figured out that they should know each other.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:27.660]   - You want to know.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.660]   - Wow.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:30.660]   - Oh, learn also what I think.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:37.660]   - The folks of Twig, uh, because we, uh, as of this morning, I've sold more than 5,000,
[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:39.660]   uh, Gutenberg the geeks.
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:41.660]   - Kindle singles are hugely successful.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:47.660]   - At 99 cents, I shouldn't quit the day job, but, but I know it was a lot of Twig fans who did that and have been tweeting about it.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:51.660]   - I'm grateful and I'm really, I'll write about the experience a little bit later, but it's really very cool.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:53.660]   - You know, go ahead.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.660]   - You know that Kindle singles crossed the 2 million sales mark today.
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:57.660]   And that's thanks to you.
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:35:58.660]   - Oh, okay.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:35:59.660]   - It was a good one.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.660]   - You put it right over the top.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:05.660]   I, I tell you what, you know what I'm going to do?
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.660]   And, uh, I see you have an iPhone.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:09.660]   Do you use any Android products at all, uh, Jeremiah?
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.660]   - Um, well, we have not really.
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:16.660]   - I mean, I was going to give you a chance to maybe recommend an app or a tool or something like that.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.660]   - No, nothing comes to mind right off hand, but I'm just still experimenting with all the social networking tools.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.660]   And you'll find my recommendations on my blog.

[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.660]   - But you're the big one.

[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:29.660]   Um, some type of dispenser.
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.660]   Very good.
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:31.660]   Very good.
[01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:32.660]   You're right.
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:33.660]   Sticker dispenser.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:34.660]   Name tag dispenser.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:35.660]   No.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.660]   When I grew up, Jeff might recognize this.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:39.660]   I can't see it.
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:40.660]   I don't see.
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.660]   Hold on.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:42.660]   Hold on.

[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:45.660]   Uh, no pad though.
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:46.660]   You're close.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.660]   Let me give you a product shot.
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.660]   Around, around memo thing for shopping lists.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:50.660]   There you go.
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.660]   See Jeff knows because we grew up with these.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:53.660]   I'm an old fart.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:55.660]   They didn't, they, my mom and I have been looking for these.
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:57.660]   We didn't have Gina's application then.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.660]   We didn't have software when I was growing up.
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:01.660]   We didn't have smartphones.
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:03.660]   This was, this was, this was Gina to us.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.660 --> 01:39:05.660]   Exactly.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:08.660]   This was, this was, uh, to do that text.
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:10.660]   Really text.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:11.660]   What?
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:12.660]   What?
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:13.660]   What?
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.660]   So watch.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:15.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:16.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:17.660]   Well, I can't believe it.
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660]   She really is amazed at this.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:21.660]   The younger generation never heard of this.
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.660]   Did you find one?
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:24.660]   That was the thing.
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:25.660]   And guess who makes these?
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:26.660]   The Germans.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.660]   Not truly.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:28.660]   Not truly.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.660]   So it's like a receipt.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:32.660]   It's like a handwritten receipt dispenser.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:34.660]   Like a telegraph.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:35.660]   She's, she's, she's.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:36.660]   That's so old.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:37.660]   They told you, kid.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:38.660]   So young.
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:41.660]   Okay, so you hang this on the wall, all right?
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.660]   And when you need milk, you write milk.
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.660]   When you need bread, you write bread.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:47.660]   When you need butter, you write butter.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.660]   Then you chill it out.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.660]   And you tear it off.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:51.660]   Like, I mean.
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.660]   It's like, it's like an old fashioned to do list.
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:56.660]   I fought, my grandfather-in-law had one of these on his wall in his kitchen.
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.660]   Yes.
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:58.660]   And I was like, what the hell is this?
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:39:59.660]   Yes.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:00.660]   And they don't make them anymore.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.660]   Except the Germans do.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.660]   In fact, I got to show you the box.
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:06.660]   You're going to laugh at the box.
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:08.660]   I actually dig it.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:09.660]   I like lo-fi.
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:10.660]   It's so cool.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:14.660]   This is, I've been looking for this for ages and I finally found one.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:18.660]   So then you tear it off and you start a new one and you take it, you pull it down, tear it off, take it with you.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:21.660]   And then, and this, whoops, this hangs on the wall, obviously.
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.660]   Where do you put the batteries?
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:24.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:25.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.660]   Where do you plug that in there?
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.660]   And, but when I, but see, I grew up with this.
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:32.660]   I thought this is commonplace and there's even got a little thing for a pencil.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.660]   I thought this was commonplace.
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:36.660]   You already threw the box out?
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:38.660]   Yes, well how am I going to take this home?
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:41.660]   Save the box for me, will you?
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:42.660]   I'm a roll-mus.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.660]   I'm a roll-mus.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.660]   I'm a roll-mus.
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:46.660]   I got, I bought some rolls.
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:47.660]   Oh man.

[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:13.660]   (laughs)
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:16.660]   -Prix to Deutsch. -Yeah, no.
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:23.660]   And then, what's funny is that this is stainless, I mean, this is like, this is so much more serious than the kind of faux old-fetch.
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:26.660]   Well, Leo, the other thing was, I don't know if you did this, but I thought everyone did this.
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:28.660]   That's what you make in woodshop.
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:29.660]   Right.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.660]   Yeah.

[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:34.660]   -Suck with it for years. -Yes, exactly.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.660]   You guys know what wood is?
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:37.660]   Woodshop.
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:38.660]   Woodshop.
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:39.660]   Woodshop.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.660]   -You can make it in metal shop, I guess.
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:42.660]   -Oh, metal.
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:43.660]   Oh yeah, I know metal.
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:44.660]   -Yeah, and I got it on Amazon, so they've already-
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.660]   -It's our equivalent of a shop of plants.
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:47.660]   -The equation's already found it.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:48.660]   (laughs)
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:50.660]   Right, it's your equivalent of a-
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:53.140]   - Uh, a company, introduction to programming.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.340]   I don't know, I think this is designed
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:56.700]   so you don't need a spindle,
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.540]   but maybe you do.
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:58.600]   Maybe there is-- - It looks like you do.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.480]   - Yeah, it looks like you do.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.620]   - That's why you need woodshop.
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:01.940]   You can go make a spindle.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.460]   - Maybe I left the spindle, uh, spindle--
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:05.300]   - In woodshop?
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:07.300]   - I don't know.
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.800]   - So now what can we do if we hooked
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.000]   an Arduino up to that thing?
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.640]   (both laughing)
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.640]   So here, here's what we'll do.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.360]   We'll manage all the length of paper.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.220]   You pull off every day, and chart it
[01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:18.940]   as an indicator of your productivity.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.860]   - Just do tidy, or you put every,
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:22.300]   you already threw it all in the recycling.
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:23.420]   (both laughing)
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:26.020]   So just check and see if there's a spindle in there.
