[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Hi, it's Jeff. Leo is not here. He's on vacation. He's not kidnapped.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The show still went on without him and we didn't get into fights about moral panic or Gutenberg or anything.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And Stacy and I had a great time talking about Stacy's house and her bad memory, about fleeting fleets, and about Facebook still confusing us.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   All of that is coming up next.

[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   It's time for this week in Google. I know what you're saying right now.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Oh no, where's Leo? It's going to be two hours of Gutenberg and moral panic.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Oh no, no, no, but fear not. I'm not alone. I'm here with the two best people we could be here with.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Ant Pruitt, the amazing wonderful moral panic king. Ant Pruitt is here. Hello, Mr. Ant. How are you?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Hello, Mr. Jarvis. I don't believe we'll have that you, sir.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Good. Ant has worked like crazy. He's not only on the show. He's been producing the show. He's been putting stuff on the rundown.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   He's putting coal in the in the burners to keep the power on ants doing everything alongside jammer be behind the board.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And of course, we have Stacy Hickenbotham.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Hello, and I am doing Stacy.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You're being Stacy. That's all we need you to be is brilliant Stacy. Leo is in Hawaii, damn him, having a good time and drinking drinks with parasols in them and such.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   But he'll be back in a week. It is a hard life. Somebody's going to do it.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So we're here on our own and I'm the putative host. You can blame me for everything that goes wrong.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And I'll blame jammer be or answer somebody. But here we have we have a packed rundown. We'll have a lot of fun.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And so here we go. So the first thing I figured out to talk about was I want to hear your reactions first Anthony Stacy to Richard Branson in space.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Well, I think I'm one of the people that really did not care.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   But I think that's the fault of the media as to why I didn't care about this because I think it was Sunday when this all went down. Right.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I think it was Sunday, but you go to Twitter and everything is talking about Branson goes to space and billionaires beats this other billionaire and goes into space.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yada yada yada yada. And I'm just thinking, you know what? Normal folks like myself. We really don't care that these people that have all of this extra disposable income granted they earned it.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Sure. But we don't care about them flying into space and coming back. It's just I didn't care for it at all.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But what they failed to point out at least a lot of the media failed to point out is this is stuff that could be used for research far as travel because it you know who knows down the road it may be less expensive and faster to go places over, you know, through the air and whatnot.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But none of that was even brought up. It was all about who got their first and how did they do it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And it just seemed like a bunch of and we got cash and we can do this and you can't, you know, and if they want to go to Mars, I'm to the point. Hey, have at it. Go leave me back here.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Stacy, what did you think as you were watching? Did you watch?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I didn't watch. But the whole time I'm very excited about space. I'm a huge space nerd. I wanted to be an astronaut. I went to NASA as a kid a couple times because I lived in Houston.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So I am like this content should be speaking to me. But I will say reducing.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Which should be a team effort like you just don't go to space on your own. You go to space with a team of like hundreds of people working behind you. Right. So this idea of these people.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It felt super self-aggrandizing. It didn't feel like I don't know if the media just didn't report the.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   The levels of research. But I'm kind of like, I mean, I get very excited about the shuttle launches, the dragon, you know, the reuse of a shuttle landing back.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   All of that's really awesome because it feels like we're forwarding technology. But when you put people in space, that feels a bit like a vanity project.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Kind of like I wasn't super excited when Elon Musk stuck a car up in space. I'm like, buddy, what? No, space should be pure engineering.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   We're already excited. It's like poetry. It's engineering prowess. And what we're doing is turning it into this like.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Big swing in. I can't say the word complex. Big swing in Richard. Yes. Yeah. Big swing in Richard.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   What I dig about the stuff that SpaceX was doing was the engineering part of it. I'm sure he sent the car up into the heavens and whatnot.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But I always look forward to those boosters coming back and figuring out from an engineering standpoint how to properly land those things.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   That stuff amazes me because it changes the economics of going to space. I mean, there's people that are smart enough to figure that stuff out.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   But yet you go and ask somebody on D Street and pedal home into parallel park and they can't pull it off.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And somebody said we should give credit to Elon Musk for not putting himself in space.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yeah, he did put his car in space. Richard Branson's.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I was, you know, and I'm the guy here who tends to say, oh, innovation and capitalism. And, you know, I was offended.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I was just outright offended. I thought it was such a display of wealth for wealth's sake.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I think you raised a really good point, Ant, that there are things to be learned.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Nobody emphasized that. Nobody said this is how we're going to benefit from people. They throw that in there, but they wouldn't really give examples of how.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And it was mines faster than yours and mine is bigger than yours. And they are phallic symbols. They just, they just are.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Sorry, they just are. It is. It is what it is. And, you know, you didn't really get to space. You know, it's 50 miles.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   As somebody said, it was a drunken pilot who just went a little too high.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And, and Bezos is now saying he's going to go higher. And then this, this, this Austin, the most ostentatious thing to me in the end was putting on the, on the wings and calling themself an astronaut.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I'm an astronaut now. Right. A lot of people worked really hard and studied really hard and risked their lives and some lost their lives to be astronauts.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And, yeah, I was, I was, I surprised myself with my, my visceral reaction to it.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I think we have to keep in mind what you said, Ant, which is that, which is that we can learn things, which goes, what Stacy says here, which is that it can serve the higher purpose.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But there was no engineering to that discussion to the coverage. Yeah. None.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Well, big swing and Branson. Yeah.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   There we go.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   You'll decide, Mr. Producer. You'll decide.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah. So, so that was that. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai was interviewed by the BBC. I'm sure you didn't, I actually listened to the whole thing.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   We have a little bit of video here. If John wants to go to it where the guy has Sundar play cricket, which is kind of a nice moment.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I don't know if he's interested in me that you wanted to be a cricket player when you grew up.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And that makes two of us. So I have brought my lucky charm.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   This is my talent has been my special thing, which I had on my desk when I was a newspaper editor.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And if you have time, I've always wanted to bow with a boss of Google or Googly.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So you could just have a little knock somewhere around here if you've got time.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Why not? Let's do it. I'm glad it caught bad ball.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I told her, yeah, I told her, cause you any problems by taking your teeth out. Not a quick 10 billion off the share price.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   The show is more teamwork than the C-sister.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I'm receiving a sticker Google search on this.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   He came back.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   All right. This is adorable.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I'm going to smash it.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   He's got his ears, isn't it?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   All right.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I mean, it's basically by boys playing sports.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I did bully your cool dog.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Okay. So Pachai is human, huh?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It was a good, cool.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   He's a nice man.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   He's the good guy. He's the good guy.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You know, I listened to the interview and it struck me.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It's like BBC interviews. They try to be tough and they try to be front of.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And all it is is he went back to the Wi-Fi sniffing.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Do you really care about privacy?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   If your company was Wi-Fi sniffing, of course, that was before you were in charge.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You really weren't responsible for it.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So I'm not sure why I asked.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I had nothing else to throw at you.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So he throws things at him that we all know.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   We all see.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And it was disappointing.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   He seems like a good interview.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   He seems like a very smart guy.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And that's all fine.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   He has a new show on BBC.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   That's all fine.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I'll throw a question to both of you. I don't have an answer myself to this question.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   If you had the chance to spend an hour with Sumdapar Chai, what would you want to know for me?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I would like to know his vision of where he thinks technology is going and what kind of...
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I mean, so I'm super nerdy.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So I'd be like, "Hey, what kind of architecture?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   What kind of world are we building?"
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   If you think about where the form of computing that we have today with massive data centers,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   with disposable consumer devices, with amalgamations of data, if you were reinventing that, what would you want it to look like?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And then how can we get there from where we're at?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So I would try to be both visionary and practical.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Because I feel like every CEO has to think that way anyway.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   What would you ask me?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Two things.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   First, what are you going to do about just the whole focus of Alphabet and Google?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Because I think I've mentioned this before, but everything seems to be so scattered from a product standpoint,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   where there's something going on with Android, where there's something going on with the hardware itself, Chromebooks, the phones.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   It never seems like there's... or even apps, all of the apps seem to just sort of be here for a minute and then they're gone.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   They're here for a long time and never really touch, but they don't really kill them off, such as Google Voice and things like that.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So it always seems like it's just a big scatter of leadership and management when it comes to their products.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And secondly, I would ask them, "Did you really want to be CEO at Google or..."
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   What do you think the answer to that is?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   He seems like he was pretty ambitious, and this is something he wanted to do.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   But there's no way I had to jump.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I don't think you're a CEO without wanting to be a CEO.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   You don't just run a... someone doesn't...
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   "Oh, you've been doing a great job. Let's have you be the CEO."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   That doesn't really happen.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   No, that's some serious...
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's how much of the rest of management happens.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Yes, we ever see in journalism, the good reporters become editors and they don't know how to edit or manage.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   But nobody in journalism knows how to edit or manage.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   That's not what the industry is dying.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Yeah, I don't want to ask them about... so the guy asked them things like, "Well, you're the 11th largest economy in the world.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Do you have too much power?"
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I'm not sure what that means.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I'm not sure how I would answer that. What does that equate to?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And as we kind of said, he said, "Basically you're mixing apples and gumquats here.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   We're not a government. We're not a country."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   But I would want to hear from him about the responsibility.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I would want to hear that after the great days of the huge optimism and now into the dystopia we have, the moral panic...
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Sorry, I had to do it.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Try and stop me.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   What is your responsibility?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   What have you learned? What do you need to do differently? What does make a great company?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   No.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   There's so much I'd want to ask him because he doesn't speak that often in that kind of way to get him for a full hour.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I was just kind of sad that it was the usual, "But what about? What about?"
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And I think...
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   You don't know what made it on the cutting room floor.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And I would say, having done...
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   At Fortune we used to do sit down interviews that were videoed.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And some of the more thoughtful questions were then edited or thoughtful answers were edited into these weird soundbites.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So, I mean, I do think Pichai is a very thoughtful individual.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And so I think that he's probably thinking about these things.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Maybe he doesn't articulate them. Maybe his PR people were like, "Let's not do that."
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   You don't want to get him started on this.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   That's a good point too, is that he could have given a really boring answer to a good question.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Well, it's not just boring. It's like when someone...
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Well, I was just going to say, sometimes when you talk to people who are on another level who are thinking about the big issues,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   you're not ready to sit down and listen to their response. And certainly not on television.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And I think that does get lost. I mean, I've interviewed these people who are just brilliant.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And when you get them talking about things, to get to their answer, you have to go through thickets of weird information
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   that explain their thought process that gets due to the nuance.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   But all of that gets cut out. I don't know.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Because I guess just because it's the TV time constraints, that's what you're saying.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Because it's in the TV video.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Well, even as a journalist...
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's sometimes boring. You're like, "Oh my God, why are you telling me about Shakespeare?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And what about the history of monkeys? How...what?"
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And then you get there and you're like, "Okay, that was worth it."
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   But you know that most people are not going to sit through all of that, right? I don't know.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Hmm.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Let me tell you about the history of monkeys and Gutenberg.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I can't you not. I talked to the guy in charge of neuromorphic computing at IBM.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Darmindra, I can't think of his last name. Brilliant fellow.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Such a great interview. Totally useless if I were going to put it on television.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   He talked about Shakespeare. Monkeys.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I think the plague even came in there. But yeah, it was just never going to make it.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   One more story before we'll do a commercial and a treat from Stacy.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It surprised her. And I want to see from her.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Treats.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Treat. Treat.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   It's a waffle. For everybody. Everybody gets a waffle under their chair.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Just check right now. You've got a waffle there from Stacy.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Yes.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   More queso.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   More queso. A little messy, but...
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   So Google got fined $593 million, $500 million euros, I think it is,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   by the French antitrust agency because they were not negotiating in good faith
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   with the French publishers.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I'll go ahead. Just the suspense on this.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Jeff, what are your thoughts on this?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   You can imagine what I'm going to say. It's really hard to be accused of
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   negotiating in good faith with black mailers, as my view.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   This is part of this, the extension of the Leistung Schutzrecht come to
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   all of Germany, the ancillary copyright, they're being forced with a gun
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   inside their head to negotiate air quotes with these publishers.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And Google, I think, is right to hold tough and is right to say that
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   negotiation means that we have our chance to say what we want to do
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   and we actually go back and forth, but that's not what the authorities are
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   doing. And then my friend Ben Evans, who I quote, I think every time on the show,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   had a fascinating little tweet that said that the fine is about equal to
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   the entire market valuation of the major French newspapers.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   For that fine, they could just buy the newspapers.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And so what is the money going to? What does this money really mean?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It's a huge fine. It's for the sake of emotions and saying,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   "It's fine to Google around, aren't I good?" And everybody stops Google around
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and then what did it get us? So I had to get that off my chest.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   That's why I had to say, what about you guys?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Well, so I have a little... Go on, Ian.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   No, I see it similar to you. It just seems like more of a big ego stroke
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   for the folks in France to say, "Hey, yeah, we can slap them around and have them
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   do what we say is right regardless of what our readers here in this area are
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   looking for."
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Well, France seemed to be, as part of their negotiations,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Google had said, "Hey, we are going to pay for some content."
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And they said that they would pay for content.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   I guess the French regulator said that they would pay the same amount it would
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   for dictionary listings and other data.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   So I saw that and I was like, "Part of as a journalist, I'm like,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   but journalists in news, we actually do work. We're much more than just straight up data."
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   But then I think about, you know, how do you charge for context?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And that's tough to negotiate or think about, right?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Right.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Well, it's also the problem with the Australian negotiations, too,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   is there's an exchange... You have to acknowledge there's an exchange of value.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And the publishers and the government seem to presume that everything goes to
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Google because Google's the one who's successful.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But in fact, Google keeps sending an audience to the publishers and publishers
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   who don't know what to do with the audience.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Well, that... They don't always send... I mean, Google can send audiences to publishers,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   100%. But they can also, like, basically, if you're a publisher,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   you need to be investing not in data stories, right?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Like, that's going to be commodified really fast.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You have to provide context and a point of view.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And I don't know that there's a huge audience for context
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   and a point of view beyond, like, the quick clickbaity things, right?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   So I think this is really tough.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   You're biting human nature.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And I don't know where... I mean, we're just in a bad spot.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Journalism is just...
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Okay, Steve. We'll get out of it.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Yeah, we are.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I even saw a story that's written on the rundown that the Atlantic...
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It was a good piece of Dylan Byers in NBC saying that the Atlantic is losing a lot of money right now.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And the new CEO who came from Wired, who's very smart, says that we profitable next year,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   but I mean, they told the staff, honestly, where it was.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And it's almost a case where they had too much money, where we impaled jobs,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   gave them a huge amount of money.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   They hired 100 people. I subscribed to the Atlantic, but it was, it was,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   it was like worse than a pile of unwread New Yorkers.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   It was... They almost had too much.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   We're trying to do everything, right?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And it occurred to me that Bezos...
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Well, he'll be unsung at this, but he was brilliant at giving the Washington Post the resources to be successful,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   but also giving them discipline.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And I've already once served me a white knight. It's money from Google or it's a rich person coming after you.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   You've still got to make the venture work. I mean, you know, you've had to work Stacey around ventures that...
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It didn't work. And it's painful to see that happen, right?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Is it easy enough to equate this to you walk into a restaurant that is their quotes high-end restaurant,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and they bring you a menu that's this thick and that that'll never work.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   But if someone brings you a menu that's got 10 items, you know, maybe it's just one or two, one or two pages,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   that restaurant is probably just absolutely crushing it.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Is it the same way to...
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Yeah, I think it's right. If you went to a Mexican restaurant and they tried to say, "Oh, here's our flog-wah page."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   You'd scratch your head and say, "Where am I?"
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Now, there is, by the way, a law in New Jersey, by the way, that every single restaurant in New Jersey must serve pasta or it falls.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And it's the state of pasta. You must have some kind of taco.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Period.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   There's a job, but I didn't put the one down.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I'll have those.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   McCormick Spices has a new taco ambassador job.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   They want to push their spices to taco people.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I didn't put that in the rundown nor did I put in the rundown.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Thank goodness.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   That's insulting.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The ice cream manufacturer that honest to God has craft macaroni and cheese ice cream.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I chose to have a higher level than today's show.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   While we're on news, I'll make one more thing.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Those food stories from Jeff.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Yes.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Gross.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So, so Murdoch tried to compete with Google News a year and a half ago.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   You remember he started to news.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Right.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   To use his effort at having a balanced neutral response to Google News.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Well, guess what? It just happened.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It folded.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   It's dead.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   It's gone.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Murdoch has failed at everything possible with the Internet.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   This is why he hates it so much.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   My space.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   The I worked for him a long ago with Delphi.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Everything he's done with the Internet has failed miserably.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And here's the latest one.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So, goodbye canoes.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   It's gone.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   All right.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Why don't we take a break.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And when we come back, I want to have Stacy give us a tour in words or however she chooses of her modern home.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   I was fascinated by this and I created a piece of the rundown entirely for Stacy stuff.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   And mainly they get that in there, but anything else it might seem to be Stacy-ish.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   And she said, what are you talking about?
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   What?
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   She was like, really?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Huh?
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   She was like, what do you mean?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   What are you going to do?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You're going to be smiling.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   What the hell are you doing?
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   You called it the Stacy home tour and I was like, yeah, wait.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Just because I took people in.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   You'll find out when we get back.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   How are we going to have a tour of Stacy's home?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   But in the meantime, we're going to hear from Leo not on the beach.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   He's too smart to be doing these.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   He did this before, but for one of our beloved sponsors that makes Twit and Twig possible.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Hey, if you don't mind, I'd like to interrupt briefly.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Yes, I know I'm in Hawaii right now, but I was so excited to tell you about our new sponsor.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I had to come back.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   No, I'm recording this ahead of time.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And it's not technically a new sponsor.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I've known about Wealthfront forever practically since they've started these days.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And you've heard us talk about this on Twig.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Investing is complicated.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   It's confusing.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   It could be a little bit scary too.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   We talk, everybody talks about diamond hands and stonks, memes and rocket ships.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Day trading is okay for some people.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   But if you want to build long-term wealth, you need something a lot more serious.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   You need Wealthfront, a Wealthfront investment account today.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I'm going to tell you this.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   I say this every time.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   I tell everybody I know this.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I tell my kids this.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   For some reason, nobody believes me, but it's really true.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Decades of data show investors that trade individual stocks underperform the market every year.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   So you know that guy says, "I'm making so much money in day trading."
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And one percent of day traders beat the market.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Only one percent.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   The market beats them almost every time.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   In fact, there's a very famous bet Warren Buffett had with some hedge fund manager saying,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   "You know, I'm just going to invest in the market and I'll beat your hedge fund."
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And he did.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   He did.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   The odds are not in your favor if you're doing it alone.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   You should team up with Wealthfront investing, complicated, confusing.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   But I know you want to have some agency in this and that's what Wealthfront's great for.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Beginning, you're brand new, you're just getting out of college, you're starting up your retirement
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   funds or you've been investing for years.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Wealthfront makes it easy.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   No matter what your needs, your portfolio, your goals, they have the right tools.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   They can create a portfolio for you.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   This is, and these are the words you want to hear, globally diversified, low cost index
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   funds personalized just for you in minutes.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   No manual trades, no picking stocks.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You don't need to watch the stock market every day.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   That's a recipe for disaster.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   That's a headache in the happening.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Wealthfront handles all the investment.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   You set the preferences.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That's where your agency is.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   You say, "This is my goals.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   This is what I like.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   This is the risk I'm comfortable with and you let Wealthfront handle the rest."
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   They also do something that's incredibly complicated but is very important to save you money,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   something called tax loss harvesting that lowers the taxes you pay as you invest.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   For a typical client, tax loss harvesting with Wealthfront can more than cover their low
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   advisory fee.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Of course, the fee is very low.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   It's 0.25%.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   But the Wealthfront harvesting happens automatically.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   That's probably why Wealthfront now, when we started talking about them years ago, they
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   were just getting started.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   They now handle $20 billion of assets.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   In fact, they've got a great offer for you.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Your first $5,000 managed for free.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Forever.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Go to wealthfront.com/tweg.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Now, I'm telling you, if you're young and you just put that $5,000 and you don't, you know
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   what?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I know you, I don't have $5,000.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Put in a few bucks a month.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.560]   It's the right way to go.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.720]   All you need is $500 to get started.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.760]   You don't have to have $5,000 up front.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.280]   Grow your Wealth the easy way.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.800]   Let Wealthfront do the work for you.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.880]   They're really a great company.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:12.000]   To get your first $5,000 managed free for life, go to wealthfront.com/tweg.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   It's W-E-A-L-T-H-F-R-O-N-T.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Wealthfront.com/tweg.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.400]   To start growing your savings, do it right.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.000]   Go to wealthfront.com/tweg and get started today.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.320]   I think just, you know, if I could go back in time 40 years, I was just getting out of
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.680]   school to start my career.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.760]   If I could have just, of course, that didn't exist back then, but I'd save your money,
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.560]   and put it in Wealthfront the minute they start.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.360]   Wealthfront.com/tweg.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.160]   Hey, they're around now.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.480]   There's no better time to start than right now.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.040]   Wealthfront.com/tweg, we thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.400]   All right, back to you guys.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.320]   Thank you, Leo, and thank you Wealthfront.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   I'm glad you realized that Twig and Twit people are wealthy and need help with their
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.800]   wealth because we're just so smart and successful.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.840]   I'm delighted with that.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:14.120]   So Stacey, I looked to Stacey on IoT and I said, "I wonder what's on Stacey's brain?"
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.640]   And right there was this beautiful post of exactly what I wanted.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.080]   I wanted to hear everything about Stacey's now newly connected home.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.280]   And when I said, "I want to see this," she again, she just acted like I was violating
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.000]   her privacy because she forgot she wrote it almost.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.640]   Oh, you're muted, Stacey.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.120]   Oh, she's muted.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.200]   Dang it.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.480]   I did forget I wrote it because I wrote it last week.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.640]   That's just life on the edge here.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.640]   So yeah, I wrote about, I've been in this house for a year and I hadn't really set up
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.880]   my smart home and my prior home because it was a rental.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.920]   And after a year here, I kind of was like, "Well, really it's as set up as it's going
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.560]   to be for now."
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.000]   And the big caveat is I am waiting for matter.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.480]   It used to be project chips.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.080]   So I'm waiting for a lot of devices.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.120]   So I'm not purchasing some things that need to happen.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.720]   Well, stop right there for a second.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.320]   Tell us what are the kinds of things you're waiting for.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.160]   I'm eager to hear about that.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.160]   Sure.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:20.440]   So I, in my Austin home back when I was crazy, I had all of these hubs, all of the Z-Wave
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:26.640]   gear, some S.C.E.C.E.C.E.C.E. and I was creating these crazy recipes like if this sensor detects
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.760]   motion but this sensor hasn't detected motion and this sensor says it's daylight during
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.880]   this light on, right?
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.440]   There was a lot.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.840]   And I would spend like an hour to two hours every week, like keeping everything up to date
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.640]   and playing with stuff and futzing.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.880]   I don't do that anymore.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.640]   I gave up on all of that because once they, once project chip was announced, I was like,
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.880]   "Ooh, this could be good.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.120]   This could make all of that stuff.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.920]   I do obsolete, please."
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.720]   And it's coming.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.440]   We're going to see.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.320]   So I listed all of the devices that I have.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.760]   But I wanted to get that caveat out of the way because for a long time, that's what I
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.960]   did and that's why I think a lot of people followed me and they asked me questions about
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.960]   things.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.440]   And I still have smart things that I can test and do test but I don't use it in my day
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.280]   to day and I don't make my family use it.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.000]   You've not arrived in Valhalla yet and connected Valhalla.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   That will come.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.840]   Connected Valhalla has not arrived.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   I have known that.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   But what did it mean?
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.320]   But take us through what you have done today.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.480]   You showed us one thing last week which we all loved.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   You had the wall.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.120]   She doesn't remember that either.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.800]   Oh, the needle leaf.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.480]   Stacey, Stacey, I'm the old guy here.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.840]   I got no memory.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.360]   I got no brain at work.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   Look on her face.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.400]   I have no, I have the excuse.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.200]   You have no excuse.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   This is your own home.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   This is your own life.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.760]   These are the things that you have set.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.640]   I could actually look to, if I go like this, I'm like, "Oh, hello, Dana leaves."
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:05.560]   For those of you on audio, what I said, you showed us last week there was a complete
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.960]   blank look as it was done in this place.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   It was like, "Huh?"
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   "What did I do last week?"
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   That's history.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.960]   I don't remember.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.960]   Hi.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.200]   You showed us a wonderful, beautiful thing you created last week, Stacey.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   Remember now?
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   Yes, I do.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.520]   So yes, that was great.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.360]   So in addition to that, I have 30 to 50 Wi-Fi devices and all of them are geared to making
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.600]   our lives just a little bit easier, a little bit more voice controlled, mostly voice controlled,
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.160]   I'll be honest.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.200]   I detailed in this post everything in my smart home.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:48.080]   I'm going to just condense a lot of this and say most of it is running on either an
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:54.800]   Echo, an Amazon Echo, or one of a series of Google Assistant devices.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.600]   I don't have any home kit because Kevin does the home kit stuff.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   That's important to note.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.080]   We split that up because otherwise it's just too much.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.920]   In most of my automations are around lights and a couple around locks that I'd like to
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.160]   get better at that.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.840]   I have four different sets of light kind of things.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:23.560]   I have wise smart outlets, Lutron switches and a Lutron outlet, Philips Hue, bulbs, and
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.320]   banana leaf stuff.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.840]   I'm just thinking through.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.440]   Yes, and wise light bulbs.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.440]   So those four ecosystems are my lights and I have clumped them all together using rooms
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.800]   or whatnot in the Amazon and the Google apps.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.600]   So that's most of this stuff.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.720]   And then there's my boring stuff.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.000]   I have a thin water monitor device that checks my house for leaks.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I have an aquanta which is on my water heater and it says things like, "Hey, if you take
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.200]   your water heater temperature down, you can save energy."
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.480]   It also does things like it has a sensor attached in case it ever leaks.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.600]   It's a really handy device.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:10.280]   It's more for saving energy than it is for anything else, but I can use it to turn off
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.360]   my water heater and what my daughter is taking a 40 minute shower if I wanted to.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   I have.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.360]   You could turn it off.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.680]   You could freeze her out, but you don't.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.680]   Yes.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.240]   Have you been knowing to do it once just to make a point?
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.680]   No, because she's pretty good.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.360]   I mean, all I have to, she's 15 or she's 14.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.200]   So I'm like, you are hurting the planet.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.560]   And she's like, "Not the planet.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.480]   It's really, it's a low blow from my perspective."
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.000]   So water, water, HVAC, so I've got the E.K.O.B.'s.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.160]   I did find a sensor after writing that post, my husband was like, "We have a sensor.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   It's just downstairs."
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.600]   And I was like, "Oh."
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.440]   And then the other thing that's come out real handy is outdoor sprinkler controls.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.560]   I don't have an irrigation system, but I do have faucets.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.760]   And so I have the orbit beehive that actually arrived.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:10.920]   So I set that up to set up my summer watering schedule, and that is really handy because
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.200]   I feel like I'm saving water.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.480]   And that's really important.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.120]   And yet still watering my tomatoes.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.960]   I don't know.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   What else was in there?
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   Was there anything else in the mail?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.760]   You have your mailbox thing hanging down over your Christmas wreath.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.040]   Oh, yes.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.920]   That's because my mailbox is so far away.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.280]   I have the ring mailbox sensor, which by the way, does not use the Amazon sidewalk network.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.760]   I can't wait till it does because then it will actually reach far enough that my wife...
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.360]   Because right now my wife barely reaches my mailbox.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.520]   I have to stick it in the outer edge of the garage.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.320]   So that's where that's hanging right now.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.200]   So pretty.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.320]   And then the only other thing are my locks.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.480]   And I'm really waiting on the matter protocol to get sorted out new matter-enabled locks
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:35:01.120]   because I want to put locks on all of my doors so I can do a good night routine that works.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.040]   But right now I have a Z-Wave lock, but I have no Z-Wave hubs that I really want to set up
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.240]   for that.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.800]   So that'll go away soon.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   So two questions.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   I don't know.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:17.160]   Does any of this irritate your husband and daughter?
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.680]   Not anymore.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.800]   It used to tremendously because things would break.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.480]   And now nothing breaks.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.120]   Nothing is just...it's a very passive system, which is what I wanted.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.320]   Oh yeah.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   Thank you.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.000]   So it's a super passive system.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.640]   And the nice thing is my family doesn't actually know what they're missing.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:44.080]   My husband would if he knew that if all of our locks were compatible, he could turn off
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:49.360]   all of our locks just by saying good night, you know, Madam A. He would be really pissed,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.440]   but he doesn't know that.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.440]   So...
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.600]   He doesn't know what he doesn't know.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   If you have a change for...
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.920]   I never get all of this.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.480]   And it reminds me of, you know, when 10 years ago, I guess we can go back as far as 10 years
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:09.000]   ago when we had the AV system for watching television.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.480]   You know, you're home theater in a box and whatnot.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.680]   And you had the cable box and you had the TV.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.600]   So yeah, three different remotes right there.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.480]   With this smart home stuff, it seems like at one point in time, at least for the longest
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.520]   for me anyway, it seems like any time I started to go in, I was like, "Oh, I'm not
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   looking to it."
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.080]   It seems like it was just bringing back that scenario if I needed a remote for this and
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.440]   I needed a remote for that.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.640]   And it just said, "No, it all passed."
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.680]   I don't use apps.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.680]   So I am almost...
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:47.160]   The only apps I use are the E.K.O.B because I didn't set it up through the Amazon.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.960]   And there's actually no reason for that.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:58.000]   Just I didn't and then the Nanoleaf simply because I like using there's dozens of recipes
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   that you can have on your different Nanoleaf panels.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.200]   And I just never remember the names of them.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.240]   But everything else is voice or buttons.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.520]   And I have a lot more buttons than you might.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.160]   Voice buttons are automations.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:17.600]   So I actually have probably six or seven buttons that I just have placed to control
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.160]   connected lights around my house that are more convenient than the lights.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.960]   It's like Donald Trump's Coke button.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.760]   Yes, except my...
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.160]   Nobody knows what it does, but you do?
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   Yes.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.240]   Well, I mean, my husband knows what it does.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.840]   And we have, for example, a button that calls my daughter down, like on our kitchen.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   It controls her lights on and off.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.080]   Because she hated when we would drop in on her using the E.K.O.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.320]   She's like, "I don't like that."
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.800]   And I was like, "That's fair."
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.600]   So then we just set up her lights with the little Lutron, the Lutron light switch, and
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.920]   then the Pico remote, and you just toggle the lights on and off real fast.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.920]   It works like a joke.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.040]   She's like, "Oh, it's the daughter eye rolling button."
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   Oh, no, they want me.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.600]   Well, to go off Ant's question though, is that...
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.440]   So you don't have three remotes, which you have two different systems, Amazon and Google.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.360]   Do you forget which system to ask for it, for what?
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.200]   So the lights are Amazon, but the door is Google?
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.840]   Everything's dual set up.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.360]   So everything is dual set up that can be dual set up.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:25.520]   And it also just say, "Oh no, there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't connected."
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.560]   So my fridge actually could be connected to the internet, but it's not.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:33.960]   My bed could be connected to the internet, but it's not.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   I've got a...
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   What's your driver?
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.880]   Why aren't they connected?
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   I didn't see any value.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   It was, there's no need to have that app on my phone, and the use case is so not compelling
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   to me.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.320]   And in the case of my sync, the use case is compelling, but I don't have an outlet yet
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320]   under the sync.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   One day that might be connected.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   Hmm.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.840]   I could see the use case for the sync with leaks and things like that.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:09.720]   Oh, it's actually just to tell Madam A to fill my pot with four cups of water.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   Wow.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.920]   It's a handy thing.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.520]   You don't have to get out of your measuring cups.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:22.320]   You could just be like, "So Madam A, I actually missed that aspect of my connected sync,
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.400]   believe it or not.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.240]   In my devices, most of them aren't smart.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.160]   They're mostly remote control.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.080]   The smarts are the automations I build.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:39.120]   The two devices that are the smartest, maybe I would say the devices that are the smartest
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.680]   are actually the most boring ones.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.720]   So except for the June oven, which is totally smart and I love it and y'all have all heard
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.720]   about it.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.240]   And you bought two of them.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   I've bought two of them.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.000]   I actually bought so many because I gave them as gifts to people I love.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.840]   Wow, aren't you generous?
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   Ooh.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.600]   It was my parents.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.200]   They do a lot for me.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   Ooh.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.000]   But let's see, what was I going to say?
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.120]   Oh, the fin is really smart because it's looking for leaks all the time and it can tell where
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   they are.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.240]   It's actually really smart and it's really non-intrusive.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.240]   The Aquanta is really smart and non-intrusive.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.640]   But most of the other, I mean, how really can a light bulb be smart?
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.200]   The Apple's Circadia, what do they call it?
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.000]   It's not, oh gosh.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.640]   They have a circadian rhythm kind of lighting thing, adaptive lighting.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.080]   That's a good idea.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   I think so.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   I think so.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.720]   It works really well.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.920]   But you wouldn't like it because in your studio, for example, you need to control those lights,
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   right?
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.160]   But in your house, it's really nice and it just kind of cycles through the day.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.440]   I don't know.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.440]   It's...
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:53.600]   Now, what are you using as a primary command center, if you will, people listening to
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.880]   this week in Google, they may or may not know.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.360]   We have another show called Smart Tech Today, which airs on Thursdays just before my show
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.920]   hands-off photography ever appeared at the clock.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   Well done, clock.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:10.320]   They talk a lot about these types of devices and Mr. Matt Casanelli uses shortcuts with
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.000]   this iPad to handle a lot of this stuff.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.800]   What is your command center, if you will?
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.600]   My command center is usually...
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   It's both Google and Madam A.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:27.120]   So I set up the routines in those hubs.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.120]   And then that's how I control most of these.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.440]   They act as my hubs.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:37.560]   So I've used Homebridge, I've used OpenHab, I've used SmartThings, I've used a bunch of
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.560]   stuff.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   Homebridge, that's right.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   That's what you're saying.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.720]   That's what Michael loves.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.240]   And that ties all...
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:50.040]   Homebridge ties all your Apple stuff to your non-Apple stuff that's not HomeKit supported
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.960]   and allows you to control all that.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.480]   And that's all really great.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:01.200]   I just got so tired of spending so much time reconnecting things that fell off or tweaking
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.960]   you know, if I bring in a new light or I move a light bulb to someplace else, you know,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.000]   you've got to go spend all this time to re-jigger it.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.040]   And I'm just waiting for matter in ways for that to be easier and less manual on me as
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.040]   the administrator.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.640]   Was CHP or chip or whatever this call was that?
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.840]   Light late 2019 when this hit the news.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.120]   Chip was announced 2019.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.200]   It became matter earlier this year.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.200]   So those are the same project.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   Okay.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   And yeah.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.000]   And I struggle back then trying to understand it and still struggling now.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.800]   Hopefully you don't have...
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   When matter comes out is there any...
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   It's a response to be that smart.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   From what you have now?
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   Yes.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   Ah, what would you...
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.160]   When matter comes out, I'm swapping out my door locks for matter compliant locks.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   Right.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.200]   I'm hopeful that most of...
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.160]   So my Philips Hue lights will be matter compliant.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.520]   I'm super hopeful, y'all, that my Lutron stuff is matter compliant, especially because
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.160]   it's in the walls.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.560]   I think my Google hubs are...
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.720]   Next week is Amazon's Madam A live event.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.280]   So I'm hoping we'll hear about Madam A and Amazon Edge.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   Better matter.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   Yeah, I know.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   It's awkward.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.080]   I just don't want to say her name.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.720]   It's so rude.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.040]   So I'm hopeful we'll see that on some things.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.320]   I don't have a lot of cameras.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.120]   So matter doesn't work with cameras.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.320]   So I'm not going to be dealing with a lot of that.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:37.080]   And I'm also hopeful for things like sidewalk because if I had my druthers, I would be putting
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:42.480]   sidewalk compliant sensors throughout my yard and garden and tie that into my sprinklers,
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:48.360]   for example, or my floss of timers, for example.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.640]   So there's a lot I want to do.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.560]   I just can't do it yet without...
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.360]   I'm just not willing to spend that much time anymore on it.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.760]   I think for me, the most automation that I want would be just lights popping on and
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:08.000]   off when I either end in a room or leave the room and stuff like that.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.880]   I guess I'm just too much of a control freak and just don't quite trust this technology
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.360]   just yet to get it right for me.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.480]   Because again, all I can think about is just the battles that I had with remote controls
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.480]   over the years.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:28.800]   And then finally, Logitech and its Harmony remote really did help and just unify everything
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.080]   for me, but not that's gone away.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.800]   They killed it.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:39.080]   I will say, and I give it another year, check out some of the matter stuff.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.680]   I think things like...
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.160]   The good night routines are really nice.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   Like I wrote my post.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   I have seven doors leading to the outside in my house.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.760]   So being able to build a routine that would... four of my doors are sliding patio doors,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.560]   there's no way I can automate that.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.880]   But being able to lock all your doors at night instead of going around physically and checking
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.800]   them is actually a really nice thing.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   And there's lots of things that are going to be better.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.560]   And then we're also...
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.280]   There's actually a story about Amazon going for radar sensors.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:20.400]   Things like RF sensing are going to be really big for adding person detection and proximity
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.480]   detection inside the hole.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.560]   And that's going to be... do things like when you walk in the house, your air conditioner
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:32.880]   will know where you are and could theoretically cool those areas.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.560]   Your lights, like you said, would come on and off in a much better...
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.000]   And they could be personalized to you.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.240]   Things like in emergency situations, your house could say, "Oh, shoot, ants on the ground."
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.480]   And it's in the middle of the living room.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   That's super weird.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   Let's call his wife.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   Right.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.000]   Second time you've had us walk over ants' bodies in the show.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   But...
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   That is true.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Sorry, Ant.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.520]   I'm just taking you down this week.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.520]   First time was an ant.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.680]   It wanted something to drink, otherwise he'd collapse.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.680]   Right.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.440]   So I'm just two other stories.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.560]   Two of the Stacey's stories I love to get quick hits on to educate me.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:14.480]   One is Ray Aussie's blues wireless, raises 22 million, money raises is the big deal,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.440]   but he wants 5G in everything.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   Do you buy that?
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   So his...
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   His 5G...
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.440]   This is a stupid headline.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.440]   Who wrote this headline?
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   This is the first.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.440]   It's the first.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   It's Axios.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.440]   Axios.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   Oh.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440]   Was that Eda?
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.440]   I can't see it.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.440]   Okay.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:37.040]   He wants to add NBIOT to everything and CAT M1, which is technically LTE.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.360]   Eventually they might have 5G, but this is for low...
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   This is a startup.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   It's actually not a bad idea.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.360]   It's a good startup, but they want to add...
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.360]   Cellular.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.400]   Cellular to everything.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.280]   They're talking on their product roadmap about eventually adding like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   too.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:59.560]   So the point is today's product offers a radio that is easy to connect to the internet.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.680]   It comes pre-certified and it also comes with half a gigabyte of data.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.320]   So 500 megabytes of data over 10 years.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.640]   So you buy this and you get all of that.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   So remember the first Kindle and we were all like, "Oh my God, the first Kindle and you
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.880]   don't have a subscription with it.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.600]   You just download as many books as you want because it was all built in."
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.440]   This is kind of the promise that this device has.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.560]   You could just buy a device.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:26.600]   You don't have to pay any data subscriptions, but you're going to get NBIOT, which is really
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:33.520]   low data rates, or you're going to get CAT M, which is slightly faster, like slightly greater
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520]   data rates.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.320]   But you're going to get a guaranteed half a gig for 10 years, which is cool because you
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.280]   can anticipate how much that's going to cost when you're building and pricing the device.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:50.920]   So by the way, when I get my CPAP torture machine, I didn't realize.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.800]   So I have my tortures me every night.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.400]   And I had it next to the clock radio because I'm so old, I actually still have a clock
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   radio.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.200]   I have a clock radio.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   Wow.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   I do too.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200]   I love it.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   I love it.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   Oh, you do too.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   So here's the problem.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   It was making that horrible 3G noise.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.320]   Because the CPAP is reporting in on you to HQ.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.920]   You have to use it four hours a night or else the cops come and glue it to your face
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   or something.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.920]   Okay.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.480]   Your insurance provider won't cover it, but go on.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.480]   That's what it is.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   Yes, you're right, but I tend to be paranoid about this.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.200]   So I now had to move the clock radio somewhere else.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.920]   My wife fixes ugly as hell.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   Why am I doing this?
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.880]   Because it would keep me up all night going, doing it.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.760]   So there's cellular and things you don't even know.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.280]   I had no idea it was in that.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.280]   Wow.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   The other story.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   I did.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   Go ahead.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.600]   Oh, I was like, I feel like they should tell you there's a cellular radio in there that's
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.440]   reporting your data back to somebody.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.200]   I feel like something that should be part of the rules.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   Okay.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   What's your other story?
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   The Amazon basically acquired Facebook satellite internet team.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.040]   Oh, the project.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.920]   Is it how do you say it Cooper, Kuiper?
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:12.840]   Yeah, I think I only read it in science fiction.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:18.480]   I know what the Cooper, Kuiper belt is, but I don't know how to say it out loud.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.320]   We say as a Kuiper Cooper, tomato tomato help us.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.560]   But anyway, people who speak to other people.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.560]   I just know.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:35.520]   Amazon's yeah, Amazon's been doing a lot with satellite internet in space satellite
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.520]   internet.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.080]   Sorry, satellite internet for IOT.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.640]   Okay.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.480]   Scooter X is telling us it's keeper.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.240]   Well, that's the German pronunciation.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.240]   That didn't have scooter X.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.680]   I was like, I need a phonetic.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.440]   Good phonetically.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.000]   Like Ray Kaiser.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.040]   Is that what you're saying here?
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.040]   Kuiper.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.040]   Kui.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   Kui as a guy.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.040]   Kuiper.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.040]   Okay.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.040]   Kuiper belt.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   Thank you.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.040]   Thank you.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.240]   I knew y'all I knew someone window.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   Come on.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   Okay.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   Sorry.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:14.640]   The Kuiper project, Facebook, I guess, is not really keen on providing internet anymore.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.840]   They're just I don't know.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.000]   They were going to do they were going to do all kinds of things.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.520]   They had they had a huge ringed planes that were going to fly forever and all kinds of
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   stuff.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.880]   Yeah, with their crazy laser sights.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.120]   It was yeah, it's bonkers.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.640]   Talk about research project.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:34.320]   Anyway, Amazon's they're they're actually keen on doing this as part of their IOT efforts
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:41.160]   as part of their, you know, we're going to see Amazon getting into internet IOT connectivity
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.240]   in a big way with sidewalk with Kuiper.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:51.760]   So this makes a lot of sense because they saw their problem with not I mean, they realized,
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.640]   oh, I don't have phone that sucks and they're coming up against the carriers on things.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:00.200]   And if they can offer God, God help me for saying this and end to end solution, it'll
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   be great.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:06.600]   Well, it's interesting with that you remind me with Facebook's this is something aeronautical
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.280]   and might might enjoy.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:13.400]   Of course, they had a plane that was that was solar powered and battery powered.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:19.480]   So it would stay up doing internet connectivity from the sky and they stopped that.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:26.160]   But I just saw a story before he went on United Airlines is put it in order for 100 electric
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.160]   planes.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.960]   Yeah, I heard about that.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.600]   I don't want to I don't want to go circling in that.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.560]   Well, you want me it's it's all a short range stuff.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:42.440]   So it it makes total sense from a car here on earth 250 mile range.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.560]   I know, but it's you know, I'm I'm in Newark.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   So we get delayed all the time.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   It makes me nervous.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.800]   We're going to circle.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.000]   Our little batteries going down.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.840]   Oh, no, flight control when you when you're like you're in the air and you're in danger
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   of crashing.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.520]   They're kind of like a land first.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.720]   Yeah, it's a triage thing.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.480]   Protocols, right?
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:07.840]   Yeah, I already thought of that, Jeff.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.640]   It's one of those things that they could spend so much money making place in orders with
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.800]   the other manufacturers and have all that other built in costs with fuel and so forth.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.960]   And this is just something that's going to be more cost effective for the short range
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.680]   short range flights.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   This is a really dumb question.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.080]   It won't be any quieter, right?
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.480]   Because that's a propeller that makes noise or am I or is it actually the engine that makes
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.200]   the noise on a prop plane?
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.520]   I can't answer that.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.520]   I don't know.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.960]   It's not a prop plane.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.960]   Is it?
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.960]   I thought I was going to pick that one.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.280]   I think I'm thinking of a different thing.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   Right.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:51.480]   So, someone just got money for an electric jet.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   Really?
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   Like two months ago?
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   Really?
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.480]   Really?
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.560]   Hold on.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.280]   Are these not jets?
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.120]   200 electric air.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.120]   Sweetest.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.920]   Sweetens heart aerospace.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.720]   I thought new ones from United were props, like turbo prop.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.240]   Picture they have, which is an artist's conception is a problem.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.600]   I could just be that the newspaper screwed it up.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.320]   Oh, well, no, I think it.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.040]   Because yes, 19 electric plane is a for for prop.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.040]   Okay.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.040]   Hold on.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.040]   Let me see if I've got the name of the.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.160]   Oh, it's a 19 seat turbo prop.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.160]   No, no, no, I like to.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.160]   This is 19 seat.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.160]   This is 19 seat.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.040]   This is Sweden heart aerospace.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.040]   Okay.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.040]   Well, okay.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.920]   I think it goes around.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.720]   It's got it.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.920]   It can't be a jet.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.760]   No, I'm looking at the picture, like associated with the story and it looks like a plane.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.680]   So I'm like, ah, right.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   Okay.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   Ignor me.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   It is pretty cool.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   I got to admit it's pretty cool.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:02.280]   Well, and I don't know about you, but I know like in Sweden, there's a group of like
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:07.160]   an increase rising number of people who don't want to fly because of the emissions associated
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   with it.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.680]   There's they've got some, it's not a German word.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:16.280]   It's a Swedish word for it, but for people who like have decided not to travel for business
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.320]   because of their emissions.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:25.560]   So I wonder if this is a way, obviously this won't address all of it, but to start addressing
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.360]   that if there's a big market for that.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.760]   I think I saw Stacy that the Germany was considered was considering outlying domestic
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   flights.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   Good God.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.000]   Wait, why would be rather extreme?
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.280]   Yes, German, German Greens want to other greens until not long ago, the greens looked
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.840]   like they were going to win the election in Germany.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   Now it looks like the conservatives will, but yeah, German Greens want to ban domestic
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.000]   flights by 2035.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.880]   You have to take the train.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.280]   Wow.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   That's intense.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:03.520]   See, but if you had these smaller flights, you could go from, I don't know, Berlin to
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.520]   Saxony.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.800]   I don't know how far these things are.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.000]   And it is a smaller country.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.640]   They do have good train infrastructure.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.880]   I mean, here you'd have to like take a Greyhound and that would be dire.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:23.240]   I was going to say, would it really be that bad over there for them to deal with trains
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.320]   versus it's longer than you think to take a train ride.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.120]   Let's see a train ride.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.800]   Well, yeah, I know it's going to be longer and slower.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   I get that.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:39.520]   If you think about, I believe it was just this past Sunday on this weekend, you know, boss
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:43.000]   man was talking about just cars and how they're pretty much destroying us.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.240]   And if it's a way to save the planet, is it worth it?
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.680]   Just have an extra hour or two.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.960]   Well, did you ever take the Acela?
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:56:00.760]   Well, I mean, so like when I was in New York, I would take the train to like, I covered
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:07.400]   New Jersey and Philadelphia and I would take the train there or down to DC all the time,
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.160]   rather than just five hours.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.640]   It's a five hour.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:18.560]   But so how Humber to Munich is eight and a half hours on a train versus flying.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.800]   That's a, that's a, yeah.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   That's a bit.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   Well, what would it be flying?
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:28.200]   Oh, 50 minutes, 50, 60 minutes.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:33.600]   Okay, so 60 minutes plus two, let's say three hours just for.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   So it's, it's half.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   All the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   around it, right.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.800]   Um, let's, uh, no hour and a half.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:46.200]   That's, that's what's included who hour, 15 minutes of what you do.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.200]   Well, I don't know.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.760]   I mean, I'm sure there's somebody out there, um, that'll do some type of analysis to help
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.000]   break this stuff down and maybe even put more infrastructure in place to make it more
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   feasible.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Who knows?
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.720]   I would love it.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.400]   I like train time.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   Interest in flying.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   I've never asked you this.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   I obviously love it.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.400]   I think it's just, just airplanes have always been fascinated with just the fact that something
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.680]   that big can fly, you know, birds fly.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:25.080]   People can't fly and, but this massive piece of equipment could just goes across the sky
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   with ease.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.680]   So I've always sort of just just been fascinated with that.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   It's a wow.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:36.760]   I wanted to be, I wanted to be a pilot and quite frankly, one day I may still try to
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   be a pilot.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.600]   Um, well, the great thing where you are and you have to have a lot of wine to do this
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.040]   and I've done it is to go take flight or flights.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.440]   I would do that.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.280]   If given opportunity, I would do that.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   I do.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   After you drank the wine.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   Oh, I don't need to.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.760]   I just sat in it.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.560]   Oh, I was like, Jeff.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:04.800]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.160]   With my, with my girlfriend at the time.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.400]   This is many, many, many years ago.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.840]   I'm older and, and chicketer now.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.120]   Um, this was one of those.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.200]   This goes 100 most eligible bachelor's.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   I'll have you know.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.240]   Oh, well, and up to the wine company.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240]   That's what you do.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.520]   Yeah, you want to impress you go to the wine country.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.920]   It's the greatest thing to do, right?
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.280]   And the way you do it, what's for there after you have the wine, you get neglected.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.720]   Or see, I thought it was the Hider balloons here and I didn't know anything about gliders.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.880]   No, I will not do that.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   I will not.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.880]   Why not?
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   Well, that's like a bridge.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.680]   That's, that's, I'm okay if I'm enclosed, but I can look over the edge of the, no, not
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.680]   just even thinking about it.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.680]   My palms are, are gripping.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.760]   No, I won't do that.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   Interesting.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.760]   Interesting.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:58.440]   No, I seriously considered being a pilot and, um, in my brain, it would happen, you know,
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.640]   the years right when the youngest hard hit gets ready to graduate high school.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.880]   That was in my brain.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.240]   I was to say, okay, I want to give this a shot and try it out.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:11.720]   And everybody that I spoke to, just go for it.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.960]   Yeah, the family's been like, yeah, go for it, dude, because you're always staring at
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   planes.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.440]   You're always watching YouTube with airplanes.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.600]   You're always at the airplane overlook is why not?
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:28.120]   You know more about these planes and yet, so why ever been in a glider and have not?
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:29.520]   What's, what's amazing about it?
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.560]   Does he ever been a one?
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.600]   I've been in a glider.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   Yes.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:39.880]   Isn't it amazing when they release it and suddenly all you hear is when you're like silent
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   up there?
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.880]   I mean, it's silent, but it feels silent.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.720]   You're like, what is the closest I get to that?
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:51.480]   The closest I got to a glider was the dang, I've just drawn a blank on it.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:57.040]   But it's a little passenger plane that you could buy and literally park in your garage.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.480]   It was an amphibious plane.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.520]   A10, I believe is what it's called.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520]   Icon Air.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.360]   Icon Airplane.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:11.320]   And I got the fly on one of those with tech Republic to write about it and she cut everything
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.520]   off while we're in the air.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.920]   And it was just, it was amazing.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920]   Not quite.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.360]   It was just flying around.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.200]   Only the sounds of you screaming.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.800]   No, no, it's just what the end sounds like.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:30.320]   It was amazing just to be up there and to be in that particular seat because you're in
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.520]   the cockpit of this thing and it's small and so everything is pretty diagram intimate
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.320]   between you and the machine and the outdoors.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.920]   But yeah, that was, oh, I love that experience.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.200]   I'd do it again.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.200]   So I thought of you today.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   It was subject.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.200]   I thought of you today.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:54.680]   I was driving around doing errands and I had on a barrelsman investment fund.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680]   They do these events.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680]   They had one a day, but NFTs.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.480]   I thought finally maybe somebody can find me explain this to me so I understand it.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.960]   We're looking at the business of NFTs.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   They had a neat company there.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.440]   Have you heard of incident objects?
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.440]   I have.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.920]   Where you can buy the NFT, but it also you print it onto the device that you put up that
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   has it on it so that for dummies like me, it feels a lot more tangible.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.720]   Oh, that's what I bought.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.480]   Have you heard of this one Stacy?
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.320]   That's all it is.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   I don't think so.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320]   Me out of me.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   I thought it was cool.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.320]   I thought it was nice because it was for dummies like me.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320]   I guess I'm too dumb.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.320]   That's right.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320]   That was nice.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.080]   NFTs are still pretty dank.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.600]   I'm niche right now.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.920]   Some folks are still putting items out there to be purchased via an auction and most of
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.560]   it is going towards charity.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:52.600]   I haven't seen a lot of people putting it out there the same way they would put prints
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.920]   out, at least with the same amount of effort.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.160]   There are some that are selling things just as if they would sell prints, but most of
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.960]   the NFTs stuff that I see tends to lean more towards the celebrities and putting it towards
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:12.800]   some type of fundraise or for a charity or something like that.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.480]   They also showed there was a different use today.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:20.280]   I can't remember which company it was, but it's the company that runs a lot of the reality
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:26.000]   shows like America's Got Talent and those kinds of things.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:33.280]   They had a Neil Damon series of super heroes of mythology, fight super heroes of cartoons,
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.400]   fight super heroes of business and technology.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.280]   They had the show and they had the actors and they made collectible NFTs.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.920]   It struck me rather like the little stuffed animals gone geeky.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:52.160]   What do you call those things that have meaty babies?
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.160]   Like meaty babies.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160]   Thank you.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   I got a whole bit.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   Anybody want any meaty babies?
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.600]   They're going to be really valuable someday.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.480]   I think NFTs are electronic beady babies.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   They kind of like that.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480]   Well, that's what they're doing.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.680]   They're saying, well, we create a scarcity, it costs between $50 to $100 and we make only
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.800]   $100 or $200 of them.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:22.840]   Your kids come begging you to say, "I really want the Voltron NFT."
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.420]   Then you own it and other people don't, but then they can keep on spitting them out and
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.420]   spitting them out.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.420]   It's like, "Beany baby."
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:34.360]   No, but at least with the NFT, they can't spit out the exact same thing over and over.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360]   Well, they could.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.360]   They're doing 50 of them.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.360]   They're eliminating the number.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.360]   Well, okay.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.320]   They're saying that there's a different story.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.160]   Yeah, that's what they're doing.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.240]   It's 50 different addresses.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.160]   You're right, but it can be 50 different addresses of the same thing, right?
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.840]   But I look at it the same way I look at people collecting cars.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.520]   A lot of these classic cars that people buy at these Mika Martians and auctions and things
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520]   like that.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:03.260]   Those cars aren't being created ever again, but they continue to go up and down in value
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.260]   because it's just-
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.260]   You're smart.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.260]   I understand.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.260]   Some people.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.700]   I didn't mean to make this into Jeff an FQ 101, but I'm going for something.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:12.700]   Because what the heck?
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:13.700]   I'm in charge today.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.700]   We're coming up.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.100]   Flash that moral panic sign.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.100]   Drink.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.100]   We'll have a little fun reason.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:20.100]   A little fun reason.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.420]   Very soon, I promise.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.620]   So thank you.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.520]   You turn that on an FQ.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.520]   I buy one of your beautiful photos in an FQ.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.520]   The analogy is to art.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.080]   I can put a print up on the wall.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.720]   How do I display it?
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.820]   How do I know I have it?
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.720]   How do I show it off to myself or to others?
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   How is it-
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   Blockchain.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   No, you have like a tablet.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.600]   You're going to have some sort of-
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.420]   Samsung has their frame TV, which is the first-
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.500]   CD is going to happen in September.
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:05:00.540]   This is like the AV installers, big smart home kind of group.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:08.700]   You're going to see TVs and/or digital picture frames that are designed to show what you've
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.060]   purchased.
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:15.860]   Those already exist in things that show digital art already exist.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:19.520]   So what's going to happen is you'll see more options there.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.660]   So like Mural is one of those companies that offers one of these.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.660]   I think they got bought.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.580]   The name of an object does too in a way.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.940]   So then you get these wall frame.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.780]   Oh, Netgear bought Mural.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.780]   M-E-U-R-A-L.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:39.260]   And you'll just get these things.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.260]   And it will be lovely.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.260]   All right.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.620]   Thank you very much.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:50.220]   So speaking of giving me advice, I want to appreciate our dear friend Kevin Tofel.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.220]   Yes.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:58.060]   Who wrote a post about our own dear show and wa on about Chromebooks.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.420]   Because frankly, he's the world nicest guy in the world, right?
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.420]   Stacey?
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.420]   He is.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.420]   He's 100% the nicest guy.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.020]   Basically the undercurrent of this is, "Stop asking me this Jarvis.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.580]   I'm setting up and you ask me the best Chromebook."
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:15.980]   But he wrote it in that incredibly nice, Kevin Tofel way where he calmly took through.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:20.060]   And the best analogy was he said, "I can't tell you the best Chromebook.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:24.260]   It's like walking into an auto dealer that has every car and you say, "What's the best
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.900]   car?"
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.180]   And there isn't a right answer.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.900]   And he would push you to the Maserati or the expensive car when all you want is the
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.900]   Honda.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.740]   So you're right, Kevin.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.180]   You're absolutely right.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.620]   The thing is, I don't care about you advising everybody else about this Chromebook.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.780]   I just want you to advise me about the best Chromebook.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.780]   That's all I need.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.780]   That's like that.
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.780]   I don't know about your assistant.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.580]   I told Kevin that he should charge people for this.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.980]   I'm like, "Just give you a view."
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.980]   I would pay.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.780]   It's like there are two.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.780]   It's Chromebook therapy.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.280]   I'll get on account.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.380]   I could book you an appointment with Kevin.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.580]   I'll only take a small cut.
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.580]   Yes, I like this.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.780]   I'm waiting for you.
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:05.980]   Usually he's on.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:11.180]   If he's watching, he'll pop up at some point in time on my chat program and be like, "Okay,
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.180]   Stacy."
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.180]   So I'm waiting for that to happen.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.180]   He may not be watching.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.180]   No.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.180]   I do love Kevin.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:22.180]   I also love that he wrote a whole post about hearing his name on the show, which was kind
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.180]   of great.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.580]   So Kevin, thank you very much.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:31.180]   I just wanted to say I'm still going to get a therapy session from you.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.180]   So Facebook.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.380]   We should probably do Facebook because Leo is not here.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.380]   We should.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.980]   So we can do it safely.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:38.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.980]   I think we can.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:41.980]   Are we going to talk about Cecilia's new book?
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:42.980]   We should.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:43.980]   Yes, we need to.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.980]   Okay.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:45.980]   Yes, because I'm excited about this.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:53.900]   Well, I've only read most of the CEO versus COO episode The Times ran, which really wasn't
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.700]   that revealing, I don't think.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.700]   But they've been on a lot of shows and talking about it.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.980]   The title, again, I forget, is...
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.980]   An ugly truth.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:05.580]   One side Facebook's battle for domination.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.580]   Right.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.580]   So you've been reading about it.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.980]   Why don't you talk about Stacy?
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.580]   What does it pretend?
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.820]   I don't know what it pretends because I did not have a galley copy in advance because
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.940]   I don't really write about Facebook.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:28.300]   But yes, basically this shows a lot of your worst fears about Facebook, 100% true.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.860]   Mark Zuckerberg, not the nice dude you might think he is.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:33.780]   I don't know if anyone actually thought that.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.900]   One of the things that came out, I think this was a business insider story, it talks
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:43.500]   about like 50 something employees had access.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:48.420]   They fired Facebook, fired these employees, but they access data from the company's users
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.140]   without permission.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.300]   So they basically are like, "I work at Facebook.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.460]   I can see everybody's stuff.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.300]   Let's look up and find out things."
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   So one of them...
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.300]   But they got stopped at least.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.380]   They got fired, which is a good news.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.060]   They did get stopped and fired.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:09.700]   But Ring had a similar problem with employees illegally and not illegally just accessing.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700]   Well, more away.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.900]   Yeah, I'm like, what is the word I want to look?
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.260]   Amorily accessing user data.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:21.860]   This is a real problem that I feel like companies when you start, and you have access
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.380]   to this data, kind of like Uber and their God mode and they used to show investors,
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:28.420]   Beyonce's driving around New York and in New York.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.980]   I forgot about that.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:32.580]   Yeah, all of these things are ripe.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:36.060]   You need to build that into your company when you're building your company.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.380]   Because right now everybody has access to this.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.380]   I'll put a little...
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.180]   What is the word?
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:46.940]   I'm going to drop a note right here on the Facebook thing just for a sec stick a pin in
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.140]   this and move really fast to the Justice Department.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.860]   You know how the Trump Justice Department was seeking information on Washington Post
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.860]   reporters?
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:03.180]   Well, it turns out that a story was just released in the last hour or two that they
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.500]   didn't just go after ISPs trying to get this in Google and such.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:12.620]   They also went after a security firm called Proofpoint trying to get access to because
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:16.580]   Proofpoint handled the email security for this organization.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.180]   So the Justice Department was like, oh boy.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:25.580]   Since you handle email security for the Washington Post, can you give us data on this?
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:30.300]   So I think it's really naive if you're building a company that's going to suck up a lot of
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:35.020]   user data to think that no one's going to come asking for that data or that your employees
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:38.580]   are going to abuse their ability to access that data.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.580]   So both of those...
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:44.140]   You've got to recognize the trust needed to have people's data which is the problem
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.340]   with Facebook from day one, right?
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.140]   With the changing rules, the changing definitions of privacy, the changing services, the data
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:55.220]   circles of what is private and what is not is that it in fact can trust.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.660]   Well, I would say I don't think it's trust.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.900]   I think it's actually building the infrastructure in place that says people are going to abuse
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.020]   this and be jerks.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:07.700]   So it's actually not trusting them, trusting them to be the public is not going to trust
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.220]   you unless you build those things.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.220]   Yes, we agree.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.220]   We agree.
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.220]   So yeah.
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:19.580]   Then there's another story just out right before we got on that Facebook has had the
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.100]   service for some time that they bought.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:26.460]   One of my former students is one of the early employees there, which is something for getting
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:30.100]   the name of the company.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:33.020]   The company that gives data about what people are doing.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.020]   Oh hell.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:38.180]   You and I each put it on the rundown.
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.180]   What's it?
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.180]   No, I can't get it.
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:49.580]   There's a service that Facebook bought to provide social data to journalists so that
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.940]   they could manage their social world around it.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:53.940]   And it was controversial.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.700]   This is line 97.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:12:01.380]   It was controversial within Facebook, it turns out, because like Kevin Russe would do
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:08.340]   from the New York Times would do this regular thing of the top 10 most seen Facebook things.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.140]   Now the problem is I've always had a problem.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.980]   Facebook has said they have a problem too with the methodology here because it might
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:21.100]   be the most popular 10 things that the service saw, but we have no idea how big that actually
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.100]   is.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.180]   We have no idea what the actual impact is, which is to say that Facebook's not being
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.180]   transparent about that.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.100]   There being half transparent in a way that actually hurt Facebook.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.340]   So there are people inside Facebook who said, well, this is hurting us.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.580]   We shouldn't have this out there at all.
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.580]   But there are other people who say, well, let's be more transparent.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:42.420]   Well, the more transparent lost and this part of Facebook just got broken up and put under
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:47.260]   security of Facebook, which is, I think, too bad because it was a service to journalists.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.900]   It was about transparency.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:56.300]   So it fits into the narrative of the book.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.580]   Facebook just keeps being its own worst enemy.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.540]   That's because they're not trustworthy people.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:08.780]   That's because you let this say it.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.780]   Say it.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780]   Say it.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.780]   No, I'm not.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.900]   She already got her big swinging Branson out earlier.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   So she's used up.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:24.300]   We're re-vearing the wrong people in the quote, "tech world."
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:32.300]   And we're rewarding the wrong behaviors from a public best interest perspective.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.060]   Like going up into space.
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.060]   Yes.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:42.180]   Well, I was going to more self-aggrandizement and this idea that, I mean, if you think about
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.700]   social media, a lot of it is still about self-aggrandizement too.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.700]   So I just...
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:47.700]   Yep.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:48.700]   To its core.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.700]   I just mean the executives, you mean the users.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.100]   I mean, yeah, I mean everything.
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:55.300]   We're building ourselves into these...
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.300]   This is too deep for me.
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:06.780]   The focus isn't on, I guess, a greater good or...
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:12.860]   And I'm not saying you should always be responsible to the radar, but it's not on building a cohesive
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.860]   society.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.340]   It's not actually on communication.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.300]   It's on self-aggrandizement.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:24.780]   And it's kind of the, I guess, the natural end to rewarding capitalism for the last 50
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:25.780]   years.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.780]   It's showing its age, it's hitting its roadblocks.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:31.780]   It's not just capitalism.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.820]   It's also media in the sense of celebrity too.
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.380]   You know, it's everybody with their 15 minutes.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.140]   What makes you say is showing its age.
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:44.980]   Well, we're kind of coming to the end of the line in the sense that we're going to be
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.980]   thinking about...
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:49.500]   Like, if you think about the end of privacy, that's kind of scary.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.060]   What are we going to do to stop that?
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:59.780]   If you think about global warming in the planet, can we adjust our systems of consumption to
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.780]   deal with that?
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.780]   Can we...
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.060]   Like, I had this realization about the IOT.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:09.780]   I'm like, until we figure out that we don't want to use this data to get people to buy
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:18.460]   more stuff or to exploit people to work harder for less money, we can't actually solve any
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.940]   other problems.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.260]   And unfortunately, that's where we're still focused.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.020]   And we're going to hit the...
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:29.460]   It's showing its age in the sense that we're no longer to be able to solve the problems
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.540]   that this is causing.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.740]   Think about things like...
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:36.660]   We talk about the high cost of security, the high cost of addressing global warming and
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.660]   climate change.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.180]   You know, I don't know.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.660]   This is just me being sad.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.380]   Oh, Stacy's depressing herself.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.780]   We have to get her happier here.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.620]   I should actually put another home story in here.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:48.620]   Let's talk about...
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:52.340]   I don't see Facebook for another minute because there are two other things that came out which
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.340]   fit the same narrative.
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:57.620]   So Facebook tries to have easy solutions to things.
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:01.580]   Now they're going to all let groups anoint experts.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.660]   And this is an effort to combat misinformation.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.180]   Well, no, that's not how you...
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.500]   Expertise is not a popularity contest.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.020]   It's not the group deciding who the expert is.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:17.980]   There's an external structure like universities, like licensing bodies, like critics that
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.980]   decide who...
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:19.980]   I don't know.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.300]   What about your list of scientific COVID experts?
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.660]   That's kind of a expert to use.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.660]   I use...
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.660]   Yes, it is.
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:29.620]   But I use the fact that they aren't the Yale School of Public Health.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.060]   They were not credentialed by me.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.900]   They were separately credentialed.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:38.940]   You might find that this works.
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:41.860]   It might be helpful in some cases.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:46.420]   So in this Harry Potter world, here is the ultimate Harry Potter fan who knows more about
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.420]   Harry Potter than anyone else.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.300]   That's what's kind of a Wikipedia expertise says.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.300]   Yes, I salute that.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   I do, absolutely.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:57.260]   But I also fear that somebody can just go and start a vaccination group and declare the
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.820]   craziest person in it to be the expert.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.820]   So what about...
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.820]   What about someone like...
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.420]   I don't know how to say her name.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.180]   Zanep Tufeki?
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.180]   Yes.
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:12.420]   I know she's a professor or...
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.420]   Those challenges.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:17.060]   She's a sociologist and an associate professor.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:23.100]   But she became an expert on COVID doing the actual reading.
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:29.100]   And I would say I wouldn't necessarily expect her to be a COVID expert, but she popped up
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:30.820]   and was able to do it.
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.340]   I'm certainly saying it's possible.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:37.300]   Journalists bode up on topics.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.060]   I feel like I'm an expert on broadband.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.060]   You are.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:44.060]   The tables are turned here.
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:48.060]   No, I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from here.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.060]   I'm like...
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.540]   What I'm saying is I can see where it goes wrong.
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:51.540]   It goes to your earlier point.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.540]   I can see where it goes wrong.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:58.700]   Did I start a vaccination group and I declare as experts the greatest nuts out there who
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.420]   say that vaccinations are bad for you.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:05.700]   So then now because my expert against your expert and they're both declared experts somewhere.
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:11.580]   And that is not necessarily the best structure to get at expertise.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:17.660]   I believe strongly that the next generation of the net needs to be an expert based network.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.220]   So we agree.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.260]   But the question is, is this the best way to get there is to just enable every group to
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:26.620]   declare their own experts in Facebook?
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:29.540]   I don't know.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.540]   I don't know.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.540]   We disagree.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:37.620]   It is nice to be able to have the freedoms to create little groups like this and be able
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:40.580]   to have some conversations with like-minded people.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.340]   This is nice to have those freedoms.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:48.380]   But at the same times, it could also be detrimental if those groups become very, very big and
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:55.180]   end up getting some interesting odd power and influence over other folks based on their
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.100]   views that may not quite be accurate.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.580]   So this is just the slippery slope of the tools of social media.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:07.340]   I know Mr. Jarvis, you advocate for social media because it's given a lot of voice to
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.980]   people that didn't have amplified voices.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.620]   I'm with you on that.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:20.220]   But at the same time, there's a lot of people I wish would just be quiet on social media.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.220]   Yes.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:26.220]   But the good thing about social media is you can stop.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.220]   Yes.
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.900]   You know what I'm so proud.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:32.420]   I am blocked by Donald Trump Jr. and Peter's Morgan.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.420]   I'm very proud.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.420]   Wow.
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.980]   And Frank Sinatra called you a bum.
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:40.540]   Frank Sinatra called me a jerk.
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.100]   One more.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:46.820]   So it was Zuckerberg again right before we got on the air quotes error.
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:49.380]   Said that Facebook I think in the next year and a half or something is going to pay a
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:54.740]   billion dollars to creators.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:55.980]   And prove it creator.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.580]   What do you think of that?
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.460]   You know, I think that's a good start.
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:09.620]   I think it's an uphill battle because what exactly will Facebook and Instagram offer the
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:16.860]   creators that TikTok isn't already offering and then some and that YouTube isn't already
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.220]   offering and then some.
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:20.220]   Yes.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:28.140]   Facebook has how many billions of users but people search and they end up on YouTube.
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:31.340]   They end up on Google or they end up on YouTube when it comes to things that they're looking
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:36.900]   for in YouTubers know that and they just stick to their guns and they're going to continue
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:37.900]   to roll with it.
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:42.100]   And if they are actually on TikTok, they're usually using TikTok to funnel themselves,
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:45.460]   funnel those viewers back to their YouTube channels.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.860]   I know several people that make money.
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:48.860]   Right.
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:56.060]   So a billion dollars is a good start for Facebook, but I just don't know if it's going
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.900]   to make any difference here.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.860]   Do you see what you take Facebook money?
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:08.900]   Well, no, I would not take Facebook money, but I also, I mean, who's on Facebook to,
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:13.140]   I guess, let me think of it this way.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:18.140]   Remember the pivot to video and Facebook told all the journalists, Hey, invest in video.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.380]   I don't, I mean, a billion dollars is nothing to these guys.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:26.140]   So I take this about as seriously as I take the pivot to video, I guess is what I'm thinking.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.140]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.340]   Well, it's a rug that can be pulled out from underneath you.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:32.860]   So it's nothing to plan on.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:33.860]   It's a start.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:38.380]   They can, they can basically start in small and they're probably meeting up with some
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:45.100]   of the big YouTubers or TikTokers as we speak to start going over the details of this.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:51.820]   And you'll see some sort of soft little rollout, the same way we saw it with IGTV.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:59.340]   But again, people were using IGTV to funnel back to their content on other platforms.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.860]   You know, right, right.
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:11.700]   Yeah, I think, I think the problem that Stacy raises with the pivot to video is right is
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.580]   that is that you've got to be able to plan on it.
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.780]   And the only way you can plan on it is if you understand the underlying economics and
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.700]   is it, are there a line interest?
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.940]   Is everybody making money on this?
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.660]   So this is my share, right?
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:24.060]   The YouTube is that way.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.860]   YouTube says, okay, we sold these ads and we're not going to tell you what the share
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.580]   is exactly, but you're getting a share.
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.820]   We're making money and you're making money at the same time.
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.460]   And that's how it operates.
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:37.460]   You know, the Facebook is more opaque, I think.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.740]   Well, and you have to, the other thing is, you know, all of these platforms, you have
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:46.460]   to build on the platform, curse the end of the open way.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:47.460]   Amen.
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.740]   Now, now, okay.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:56.220]   So Mr. Jarvis, I knew YouTube isn't necessarily disclosing exactly how much they earned on
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:01.980]   the ads for someone's video, but they do give the analytics far as how much they're paying
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:08.100]   back to that creator each month in this little monthly report.
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:13.700]   You have a problem with them hiding those numbers that they put in their own pockets,
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:17.420]   considering that the platform is free to the user to.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.420]   No.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:24.220]   It's no different from Apple and the Android app store saying we're going to take 30% or
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.020]   now we're going to take 15% and then 30% or whatever.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.500]   Google for a long time didn't say what the percentage was.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:34.940]   They're more transparent about what they used to be.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:38.180]   But it's not as simple as people make it out.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.980]   So, you know, as a journalist, I had to learn business through the back door.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:48.380]   And I remember when I was, I became an executive and I learned things like corporate allocation
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:51.940]   and I was like, oh, that chair doesn't cost what you think it costs.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:52.940]   You're going to look it up in the catalog.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.820]   You're going to say that chair costs us, but no, no, no, no, no.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:00.380]   We're amortizing that chair back as a cost to corporate.
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:03.940]   And so what's profit to you?
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:08.660]   Depends on how much we charge you for that chair, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:14.820]   And how much we charge you for our corporate services and the cost of marketing and so
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.060]   on and so on and so on.
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:22.620]   So it's not really a simple calculation to say here's how Google has a Google profited
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:27.180]   from this YouTube video versus how and Pruitt profited from that same video.
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:29.340]   So I give them that slack.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:34.540]   However, again, it goes back to trust the more they they tell us the more trust they'll
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.540]   be.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.540]   That's fair.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.620]   One last Facebook story, which I want to mention because I think I think quite highly
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.540]   I said this last one was the last one.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.540]   I lied.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.540]   Don't you know this?
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.540]   I lied.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:51.340]   I'm I'm trustworthy or you could say that I'm old and have an excuse for forgetting unlike
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.020]   you young, Missy, good mother.
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:55.940]   We can't even remember last week, but you published.
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:57.940]   So don't make fun of the old.
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:58.940]   What was that?
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:24:59.940]   What was it?
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.940]   What did I show last week on the show?
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.700]   I had the history is history.
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:10.060]   So Instacart just stole Fidgy Cmo as their CEO.
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:13.380]   That's a big loss to Facebook.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.140]   Fidgy was a present and superstars.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.100]   She's only 35 years old.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:24.940]   The CEO of Instacart moved up and they grabbed the chance to get Fidgy.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.300]   She wants to Fidgy.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:27.460]   She wants to be a CEO.
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.620]   And now she is.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:32.740]   She was in charge of blue, as they call it, the Facebook app.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:36.580]   She's the one who made video as big as it was on Facebook.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.380]   She's done product and for product and for product.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.540]   She's been brilliant at this.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:42.140]   And so it's a big loss to Facebook.
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:50.220]   Casey Newton and his paid newsletters, which I get, had some reports from inside that Mark
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:55.820]   had gotten mad at angry about losing engineering talent.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.300]   They've been losing a lot of it, an executive talent.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.460]   And everything got bad at Fidgy.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:02.620]   He said one report and then other people said no, that's not the way that that mean
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:05.100]   occurred.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.820]   But that he's frustrated about this loss.
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:10.060]   And this is a sizable loss in Fidgy.
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:16.340]   I don't know if you ever watched her in Facebook presentations or not.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.460]   I never, I don't cover Facebook.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.460]   Right.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.660]   So you wouldn't know what I'd be here.
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:21.660]   Sorry.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.580]   I'm like, unless they're talking about their servers, I don't talk to them.
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.580]   Right.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:31.060]   Now, the story that I'm more interested in is something that she said there from the article
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:33.340]   was people are leaving.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.260]   Well, why?
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:40.020]   Is there any illusion that anything that leads to a lot of these developers?
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:44.420]   They're leaving because Facebook is big and Facebook is clearly making a lot of money
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:46.660]   and they don't leave that gig.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:52.060]   You know, I, this is the problem with, with the book is it's not hard for any large company
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.980]   to find people who left who are going to tell you, I'm so smart.
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.980]   I left.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   And here's why.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.980]   Right.
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:58.980]   Okay.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:26:59.980]   And I know, but I've got an unhappier job.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:01.980]   I want everybody else to be honest and happy as I am, improve.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:02.980]   I'm right.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:05.660]   And sometimes though, I'm the unhappy one.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.780]   I'm the grumpy one as if you could imagine that.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:11.260]   And they all have reasons to be happy.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:15.140]   You know, I'm out of favor or I'm not getting to do what I want to do or so on.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.700]   It's really hard to judge a culture that way.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:23.260]   I think there's obviously problems in Facebook, but some people are saying they left, one
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:27.620]   guy left over the issue of transparency and the story about the, we talked about a few
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:28.620]   minutes ago.
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.460]   I'm going to leave because they're disappointed in the ethics of Facebook.
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.060]   I think that's perfectly, perfectly plausible.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:39.620]   But sometimes it's somebody got a better job or, you know, it's hard.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.660]   It's hard to judge that, I think.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:48.500]   I can see people leaving the company because of the morals of things like that.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:52.860]   They feel like Facebook should be doing better here and there.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:53.860]   Socialing and whatnot.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.860]   I get that.
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:56.500]   No one wants to work for the evil empire.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.500]   Well, I don't know.
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.500]   Those I don't know.
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.340]   I know a lot of people like those.
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:05.140]   Like shiny helmets, you know, those things were pretty cool.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:08.460]   They got a whole starship they could use.
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:13.940]   I know people there who are some of the nicest, most morally driven people I know because
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.740]   they think they can fix it.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:16.740]   Right.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.980]   Well, I would say to anybody again, they get less.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:23.460]   They just got a new privacy person, Jeff something, something.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:28.220]   But I will say when you walk into those situations, you might buy the idea that you can fix it.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:31.300]   And in about a year, maybe two, I bet we see the person.
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.300]   Leave.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.780]   You got to, or at least got to judge yourself and say, was I fully myself or did I make
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:36.780]   some progress here?
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.780]   I'm reminded of, I don't know if I told the story before.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:45.940]   My sister is a press attorney minister and she, I remember being, when she was in Princeton,
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:51.620]   many years ago at a party, Jeb Stuart McGruder went to jail for Nixon and Watergate.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.660]   I know you're both too young to know what that is, but I'm like, you're going to go
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.660]   anyway.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:56.660]   I know what Watergate was.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.660]   My goodness.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:58.660]   Okay.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:59.660]   I'm joking.
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.900]   I'm not going to go to the story of, you'd get out, you'd be at work at the White House
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:11.660]   and you'd spend all day killing Howard Hunt's 15 incredibly dangerous, stupid schemes.
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:14.780]   You get home at night, you'd pour yourself your Scotch and you'd care actually to yourself,
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:17.220]   boy, I killed 14 really crappy things today.
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.860]   But of course, the 15th was Watergate, right?
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.140]   It's the one that got through.
[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:23.420]   And so you can, it's all relevant.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:27.380]   You can say, wow, I got rid of a lot of bad stuff, but did you get rid of enough bad stuff?
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:28.380]   Did you create enough?
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.380]   Right.
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:34.780]   The Trump people say, the people in the Trump, like the career politicians in the Trump
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:38.860]   administration, they're like, well, we killed a lot of crazy stuff.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.620]   And the person coming after me could have been worse.
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:43.620]   Don't we know?
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.620]   Give me a little credit.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:49.820]   I want to tell one quick Instacart funny on myself here.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:50.820]   So I love Instacart.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:55.540]   Instacart has been a godsend to get food to my 95 year old father in Florida.
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.380]   So we wouldn't go out of the apartment.
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:00.980]   And so once a week or thereabouts, I call and I say, Pa, what do you need?
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:01.980]   Grapefruit.
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.140]   I know you need it every week, Pa.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:04.140]   I'm a good grapefruit.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:08.100]   I like those frozen pizzas you got me, the pepperoni ones, but the small ones, the big
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:09.100]   ones don't fit in the freezer.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:10.100]   You're going to go small ones.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.100]   Okay, fine.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.100]   So we go through the list.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:13.100]   I do all this.
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.100]   And it's routine.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.180]   And I tell him, Pa, call me before you run out.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.820]   So I don't have to, because sometimes I'm ordering from Instacart and they don't have
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:23.580]   the pizzas and then he gets mad because they substitute something else.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.100]   And I've got to make sure he's got enough pizzas and it works.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.460]   So it's a whole McGill here, right?
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:33.180]   But he called this week, I tried to call him on last week on Wednesday and I'll let you
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:34.180]   know.
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:35.180]   Hey, sure.
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.180]   Yeah, yeah, Thursday, call him again.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:37.180]   I'll let you know Friday.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:39.140]   It doesn't get to the phone Friday night.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:42.580]   He calls it 10 o'clock waking up my wife.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:43.580]   I need to talk to Jeff.
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:47.460]   I need groceries because he's obviously out of his pizza.
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.340]   So I go on Instacart and make it easy as Pa.
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:51.540]   You can go to your previous orders.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.100]   They order that again, order that again.
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.860]   And when they don't have the regular cross pepperoni pizza, you can order the thin cross
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:01.020]   pepperoni pizza as an alternative and they will substitute that automatically.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:02.500]   It's a wonderful system.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.500]   Right.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:09.160]   Well, so what happened, obviously, the week before is they had substituted the bag of grape
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.460]   fruit for the individual grapefruits.
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:14.140]   And so when I ordered, I just put them on over, okay, last week.
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:15.460]   So I clicked on the bag.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:20.780]   When I meant to order seven grapefruits, I ended up ordering seven bags of grapefruit.
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.780]   Oh my gosh.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:28.100]   Which landed on my father's doorstep and he calls it a panic.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.700]   What do I do with all these grapefruit?
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:31.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.860]   So that's my little tail on myself.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:35.460]   So no grapefruit.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:41.780]   I bombarded my poor father with grapefruit.
[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:46.300]   Seven bags of grapefruit.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:51.700]   So anyway, so why don't we, so I, this Leo is very smooth about how he does this.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:55.580]   He kind of just takes a little moment and breath, but I'm not smooth and I like to mess him
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:56.580]   up every time anyway.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:57.740]   So here's where for those of you.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:00.220]   I think you just don't like to breathe.
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.820]   That's what I think Jeff never pauses.
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.660]   You're too New York for the pause.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:04.660]   That's okay.
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:05.660]   The problem with that.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:06.660]   You can take the little pause now.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:07.660]   You got a problem with that?
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.260]   We're going to take a little pause right now.
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:13.460]   And now we're going to play the trumpets.
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:18.020]   The Google change log.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:26.460]   All right, guys, help me out on these stories because a lot of gaming in here and I, I don't
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.260]   do games.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:31.300]   So the first thing I think is a panic to look.
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.300]   Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't do it.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:34.300]   I don't know.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.940]   I'm boring, I guess, but I don't do it.
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:41.260]   So Android 12 will let you play games before they finish downloading.
[01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:45.220]   Speaking of people who can't stand alone in pause in life, can't they just wait for the
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:48.760]   He got huge bandwidth, the stuff comes so fast,
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:50.440]   you can download home movies
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.000]   in the time it takes to breathe
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.220]   and now you can't wait for it to download
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:56.020]   before you've got to start playing it, really?
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:59.140]   This is a feature, tell me, am I'm crazy here?
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:01.540]   - I mean...
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:04.060]   (somber music)
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:08.800]   If you're on a cellular network it does take time I guess.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.640]   I don't know, yes, this is great news.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:11.640]   - It's got to play this game.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.360]   - Some people are.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.280]   Some people are.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.340]   - Think about the technical stuff happening behind the scenes.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.940]   This could be good for like buffering
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:21.020]   or low data rate kind of places.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:23.820]   This could be an interesting technological development.
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:26.340]   Although the first comment on the story
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:29.140]   is literally some dude who sounds just like you.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:29.980]   (laughing)
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.580]   How big of a hurry are we in?
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.700]   (laughing)
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:36.180]   - Well, I feel like Raymond's mother right now.
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:37.020]   - What?
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.540]   You can't wait for a game?
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.260]   What's the problem here?
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.380]   - So, all right, well that's big news to some people.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:45.360]   You're not going to have to wait for the game.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.520]   Are you going to stop playing immediately?
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.440]   All right, now let's go on.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.880]   So, Google tries to attract state publishers
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   with better revenue sharing.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.500]   This goes to our story before, right?
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.960]   So they all charge 30% to your point,
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.920]   and they are transparent about it.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.320]   They say it's, but that's where it does work.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.560]   It's 30% of the take you would take in.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.160]   If you were doing this on your own, we take 30%.
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.400]   Now, because state is, tell me if I'm wrong here,
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.800]   kind of a flop.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.060]   - You're going to reduce it? - You're not wrong, sir.
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.600]   - I'm not wrong for once.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.540]   - Are you playing state of games?
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.140]   - No, sir.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:25.220]   I had the whole free trial and all of that,
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:28.580]   and for pro and whatnot, and they sent this controller to me
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.860]   and they sent this Chromecast Ultra,
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:34.020]   and I did it for about three days,
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.180]   and that's about it.
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:38.940]   It was pretty, but first off,
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:41.300]   I'm just not much into games like that.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:46.300]   And secondly, the whole experience wasn't quite what I was used to
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.400]   because you're doing it over the Chromecast Ultra,
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.980]   so you get the drop packets,
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:53.580]   and it's every now and then, it's a little bit jittery,
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:57.060]   and you need that to be plugged in via ethernet,
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:00.540]   and that wasn't something I was ready to do far as running
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:03.440]   and ethernet cable to my TV downstairs
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.580]   to play video games, and just, no, no.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:07.420]   - But, but-- - But, you say,
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:08.700]   see, I don't think the other thing goes,
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:11.260]   I didn't even know this conference was going on.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:14.180]   This whole keynote from Google and Game,
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.740]   and I didn't even know this was going on.
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.740]   I just think this happened Monday.
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:19.100]   Did you even know?
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.580]   - No.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.580]   But I wouldn't.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:24.180]   I would look at this game, and that's all I need to see,
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:26.100]   and I don't wanna, and I'm not making fun
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:27.060]   of every of my games.
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:28.500]   I'm actually jealous of you,
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.660]   because you have a whole way to amuse yourself
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:31.740]   and enjoy something.
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:33.540]   - Yeah. - I just get nervous,
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.380]   and I don't wanna lose,
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:35.780]   or I don't know what am I figuring out?
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.620]   - No, I used to play video games.
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:40.580]   I've never been a big-time gamer or anything like that,
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:43.140]   but I used to play video games quite regularly.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.980]   I used to spend at least two hours a night
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:48.980]   playing Call of Duty on PlayStation back in the day.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:51.100]   - And even with that wasted youth,
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:53.060]   see what Anne has become.
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.780]   It's inspiring story of how you can overcome
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.300]   a waste of-- - It was therapeutic.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.500]   - You know, it was-- - I was gonna say,
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.300]   Jeff, you may not have games, but you have TikTok.
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.900]   - Yeah, that's the thing. - That's the thing.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.860]   - So, Stacy, I don't think I've ever actually heard.
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.380]   Are there gamers in your house, including you?
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:14.180]   - No, my daughter plays Minecraft and Star Stables,
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.100]   and those are it.
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:18.460]   I mean, I'll play board games.
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:20.660]   - Yeah, well, that's 'cause, you know, that's--
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:23.860]   - And my husband, oh, my husband has an Xbox.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:28.860]   I think he plays hockey and sports console games, but--
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:30.860]   - I don't think he's-- - I don't think he's--
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:33.800]   - On Andrew playing hockey.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.740]   - Not often lately.
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.340]   I don't think that Xbox has been plugged in for a while.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:42.820]   - Oh, we did just dance on the Wii.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.180]   That was fun.
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.300]   - That was, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.460]   I remember doing all of that stuff,
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:51.740]   but it just, it died down for me personally.
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:54.780]   I enjoyed it, but I just found out this stuff to do.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:58.620]   I have recently tried to start back playing team fortress
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.780]   on my computer here, but I'm still probably gonna do that
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:06.380]   maybe two or three times a month, because right now,
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:09.980]   when it's time for me to just sort of get away from the world
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:12.740]   and wind down or have my own little therapy sessions,
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.740]   there's other things I'd rather do.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.660]   I'd rather be sitting in the light room
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.340]   trying to do some post-process,
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.260]   and I'd rather be watching something on YouTube.
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:21.900]   I'd rather be, you know, it's just me.
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.860]   - I'd rather be researching Gutenberg.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:29.180]   - My husband plays as a way to connect with my nephews,
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.940]   so they'll get together and play together.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.340]   - That's legit, yeah.
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:36.260]   - I don't think any habit is legit, but yeah.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.380]   That's the--
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.220]   - That's an option to be done.
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:39.380]   - I mean, it's a bit of a game.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:40.380]   I'm just saying that's a good--
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:42.100]   - That's what I'm like, I'm like, okay, Bill,
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.100]   thank you, Chef.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.300]   - It could give reasons to waste your hours of your life.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.660]   It's okay, it's okay, I'm joking, people,
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:49.340]   I'm just joking, okay, don't @ me, don't @ me.
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:54.740]   So, Stadia continuing this line of desperation
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:58.580]   is created a toolkit to help bring over games for Windows.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:01.940]   - How exciting are Windows games?
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:05.540]   It's just always struck me as a bit of a oxymoron.
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:06.940]   - Fun Windows.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:11.940]   - Just to, I play my video games on a Windows box.
[01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.820]   - Oh, I think a lot of, like,
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.620]   Kacey gaming's a thing, Jeff, it's like--
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.180]   - Yeah, it's big.
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.020]   - It's big.
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:19.180]   - That's a real legit thing.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:20.020]   - It's gross.
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:24.820]   - Hey, you know how miserable Google Workspace
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:27.180]   makes you and I, Jeff, because we have
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.060]   bifurcated Google accounts?
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.980]   Now, everyone in five countries can have that same
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:35.420]   experience for the low-level price of $7.99 a month.
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:37.420]   - I pay for it as an introductory price,
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.500]   which will go up to what $9.95, I think after that.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.180]   - Yeah, I think it's, yes, but I thought that was hilarious.
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:45.780]   I was like, oh, don't do it, y'all.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:50.900]   Yeah, Google's making Workspace, or is it Workspace?
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.700]   - Workspace, that's this one's name.
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:58.820]   - Yes, in Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the US
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:01.660]   for individuals, which means you can have
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.220]   some premium features that the free one doesn't have
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:07.460]   and that you'll get your own dedicated account
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:09.620]   that will screw you forever when trying to play
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.900]   with Google's stuff.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.260]   - So I have, I have worked Workspace, Workspace, right?
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:17.380]   Mainly because I wanted my Buzz machine domain.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:19.180]   - Yeah, I have to be my main domain, right?
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:20.220]   That's what.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.220]   But way back when a good friend of mine and somebody
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.500]   who I worked with, both at my company
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.100]   and when I worked in advance and at the school,
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.380]   so I said, you wanna email the rest?
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:31.140]   Sure, I'll take one, so he and his wife
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.660]   have only other two people on my Workspace.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.300]   So I keep on paying for the corporate thing
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.260]   so I can have my old friend who I haven't talked to
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.660]   in five years still have his email.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.960]   I mean, I'm probably gonna need the email
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.820]   and see if he answers it.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:46.860]   It'll tell me whether I still need to keep paying for it
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:47.700]   or not.
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:49.700]   Maybe I can switch to seven, nine, nine a month
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:51.840]   to be irritated for less.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:55.180]   But on my Gmail, when I go into my Gmail,
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:58.820]   I'm gonna be able to find out who's legit easier.
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:39:59.820]   We talked about this some time ago,
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.500]   but I think they're finally rolling it out.
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:05.420]   Is the Google going to roll out authenticated company logos
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:06.260]   on eBay?
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:10.720]   I have that for a while, but yeah, that's, yeah.
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:15.740]   They are also, if you use Gmail
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:18.180]   and want to schedule virtual meetings,
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:23.180]   they will, la la la la, let you respond RSVP to a meeting
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:25.100]   yes, I'm going, I'll be there in person
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   or I will be there virtually, which I think is kind of neat
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:31.340]   as someone who's worked remote since 2004.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:33.980]   Well, somebody who wants to not go to the office very much,
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:38.140]   I mean, I'm going into school to teach, that's fine.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.420]   I love the students and it'll be better,
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:42.180]   but you're not dragging me into New York
[01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:43.380]   for a one hour meeting.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:46.260]   We're doing that on Zoom now.
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.380]   You're there, that's fine.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:48.940]   I'm coming in on the big screen.
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:50.620]   I'll be the big head in the room.
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:53.620]   I'm not private in for a one hour meeting.
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:57.140]   But that just seems to be the new cultural shift now, right?
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:58.740]   Yes, yes.
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.980]   But now that the boss is with you.
[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:02.820]   Go ahead.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.260]   Well, I was going to say that I think,
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.780]   if you're going to have, I do think there's truth
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:11.020]   and if you have a virtual meeting,
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:15.620]   you should have almost all of your people be virtual, right?
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.900]   So, or like if you're going to have remote workers,
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:20.300]   then you treat everyone like a remote worker.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:22.780]   And we did that at GigaOM and it worked out really well.
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:25.100]   Like some days people would be in the office,
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:28.140]   but even the California people sometimes would work from home
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:31.140]   and attend whatever meetings we were having virtually,
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:35.820]   which made sense because 80% of the reporting staff
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:38.020]   actually worked not in California.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:44.220]   In that kind of lessons, any sort of drama over,
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:47.060]   oh, you're so far away, you must not,
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:48.580]   being a second class citizen.
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.980]   And I will say working for fortune remotely,
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.100]   I was 100% a second class citizen
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:57.740]   when I was hanging out like on the polycom
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.540]   during the editorial meetings every day.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:01.700]   - And you move that closer to you, I can't hear you.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:02.700]   - Can't hear you.
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.540]   - Oh, it was so frustrating.
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:09.540]   I just, it was me, like the, the London Bureau Chief
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:13.540]   and then like one other person.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:16.020]   And we would be on our Slack channel
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:17.940]   'cause there was a Slack channel for the editorial meeting,
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.700]   the editorial meeting and it just sucked.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:24.860]   - I was thinking more along the lines of just
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:28.220]   how everybody is saying, you know,
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:31.380]   man, we just spent the last year
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:32.940]   in all of these virtual meetings
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:34.300]   trying to get stuff done
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.900]   that we would have done the previous year in person.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.220]   And we were able to get it done
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:43.020]   and we were able to get it done pretty much pain free
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:47.380]   and more cost effective and a little bit more efficient.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:51.340]   So there's no point in bringing Mr. Jarvis
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:53.940]   into the city just for an hour
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:55.900]   because we're gonna knock it out with, you know,
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:58.300]   with his webcam and he's gonna,
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:02.060]   it's not gonna change his brain just because he's in the city.
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:04.860]   He's still gonna be able to talk about whatever it is
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.660]   that we need him to discuss over this virtual meeting.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:11.700]   And I think that's just the big cultural shift
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:12.940]   that we're starting to see more and more.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.980]   And I know there's a story about Google
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:17.900]   in the rundown and their reading,
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.700]   digging on remote work and so forth,
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.620]   but we'll get into that later maybe.
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:22.460]   - Yeah, we will.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:27.740]   So Google is on the one hand,
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:31.220]   capping meets formerly unlimited group video calls
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:33.540]   to an hour for free accounts at the same time
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.340]   with the story that's basically mentioned either.
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:39.020]   But we'll sell you an account where we'll uncap it again.
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:39.860]   Why not?
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.940]   - Well, this is only for three or more people.
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:45.340]   So if you have two people, you can still talk for hours.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:46.180]   - Oh, okay.
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:47.020]   All right.
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:47.860]   So this is trying to get--
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:48.700]   - We checked that.
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:51.180]   - You can't use this for companies anymore.
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:52.020]   - Yeah, why not?
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:52.860]   - Right.
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:54.620]   So if you and your sister or BFF,
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.980]   like spend all day on a meet while you're working
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:59.820]   or something, I don't know if people do that.
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:03.980]   As long as you have only you and that one person, you're fine.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:04.820]   - Oh, okay.
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:07.540]   Two more here.
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:10.180]   Google Lens is redesigning itself to go more
[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:12.660]   towards screenshot over live view,
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:18.740]   which I guess I understand.
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.460]   You want both, obviously.
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:21.300]   You wanna be able to--
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.140]   - Okay.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:23.340]   What is that in a photo?
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:26.020]   But you also wanna be able to plate your photos
[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:27.780]   something and say, what's that?
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:28.620]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:31.820]   I won't, but-- - It's like--
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:34.980]   - I hardly ever use lens,
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:38.180]   but the few times that I've had to use it, I needed it.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.780]   And I'm glad it was available to me.
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:42.780]   And one of those times was when I was in Shanghai
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:44.420]   trying to figure out where to eat.
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:50.900]   I don't read that language, you know?
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:53.580]   Everything was, nothing was in English.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.660]   And I need to figure out what the heck that was.
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:58.700]   And it was really easy to just use Google Lens
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.740]   to pull my phone up and look at it.
[01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:04.020]   And it displayed, okay, this is beef, this is pork,
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:04.940]   and blah, blah, blah.
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:05.940]   Oh, and it was great.
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:07.740]   - I just lens for QR codes.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:09.100]   Does that, is that--
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:11.740]   - Yeah, yeah, I've done that too for the,
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:14.740]   here recently with things starting to open back up here
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:19.420]   in Sonoma County, there's the menus are all on the QR code.
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:22.340]   So yeah, I don't use lens often.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:24.260]   And a couple of times I had to use it,
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:28.340]   it's been, I'm glad I had it, especially in China.
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:33.340]   - Yeah, I went to a meeting of El Pais in Spain once.
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:38.420]   And I'm sitting there as the dumb American,
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:40.300]   as the young American not speaking.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.620]   Well, I speak a little bit of German, but badly,
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.580]   that doesn't mean I have a name.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:48.660]   And so I'm used them because this is a couple of years ago,
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:52.620]   I would go up with my phone to the screen where they're put in PowerPoint and say it
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:55.300]   would translate it for me and I was right.
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:57.320]   Who will translate.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.280]   It's just you mentioned this the other week.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.740]   Stacy, it's a miracle.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:02.520]   It's not heralded enough.
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:04.700]   What's happening with translation?
[01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.700]   It's just amazing.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.120]   I agree with you.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:09.420]   All right.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:12.400]   So is Stacy and I agree like crazy day?
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.060]   It's just Leo causes trouble, right?
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.620]   That's no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:17.620]   I know.
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:19.820]   Something's going on in the atmosphere.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.900]   Since the water here, Stacy is.
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:28.260]   Jeff, I think you're being nicer because, yeah, I don't know what it is.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.460]   Well, I see I should be.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:33.060]   If I follow Leo's example, I should be the devil's advocate.
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:34.060]   But that's what I do.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.180]   I can't imagine you playing devil's advocate.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.180]   Can you imagine?
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:40.580]   Well, I'm not going to.
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:43.700]   So the last one, Chrome, I don't understand it anyway because it went up after I read the
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:44.700]   rundown.
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:45.860]   So I don't even know what I'm saying right now.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.180]   Chrome will let you turn on an HTTPS first mode.
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:52.740]   Does anybody have an idea what that means?
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:53.740]   I don't.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:57.180]   I understand you only go to secure websites.
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:46:59.180]   Right.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:02.820]   And default view of HTTPS versus HTTP.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:10.300]   And if they pop up, if a site pops up that's not HTTPS, it has a banner at the top one.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:12.820]   Or that's all set there by default.
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:13.820]   Okay.
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:15.740]   That's a good thing.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:16.740]   All right.
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:24.100]   Well, on that on that low key note, it's time for the end of a change log.
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:29.300]   Oh, there was kind of an interesting thing in this blog post.
[01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:32.180]   Google wrote about the last issue, but I will not share it.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.740]   Please go ahead.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:39.660]   Well, okay, we did end the change log, but they said that people when only 11% of people
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:46.380]   knew what the little lock in the corner meant for HTTPS sites and instead users thought
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:50.540]   it meant the whole site was trustworthy as opposed to the.
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.300]   Oh, that's a problem.
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:53.300]   Yeah.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.540]   So that's one of the reasons.
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:59.860]   So they said they're going to re-examine that lock icon because people think of it in
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:00.860]   a totally different way.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:01.860]   I just thought it was kind of interesting.
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.660]   I'm like, oh, I could see where they got that.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:07.900]   But also that's terrible for people.
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:10.900]   But they don't know.
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:12.500]   You can only go on.
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:13.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.580]   No, I get why they would be like, oh, that that's a secure thing.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.300]   I must be in a secure place.
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.300]   Right.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:21.700]   Well, it's like the stupidity of the early days.
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:27.780]   I actually had a librarian tell students that if it said that edu or you could trust
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:28.780]   it, right?
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:29.980]   Same kind of you see.
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.700]   You don't want that.
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:37.260]   We should go on the story that you mentioned, and which is that the Google employees are
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:42.940]   mad about the search engines, search giants, hypocritical remote work policies.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:47.020]   It doesn't help if your boss has said, well, you are all going to the office, but I'm going
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:50.020]   to call in from New Zealand.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:59.700]   Well, OK, so I know Erz Hertzel, and he's I can't imagine him being great with employees
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:00.700]   anyway.
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.780]   I mean, he's not a jerk.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:05.020]   No, he's not a jerk.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:09.700]   He's just he doesn't he thinks like 80 times faster than you.
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:13.260]   And he's not impatient, but it's not like he's patient either.
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:18.740]   You know, like he's just a very smart man who I don't think comes to everybody else's
[01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:19.900]   level very often.
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.140]   Does that make sense?
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:24.700]   So I don't know if I'd want to work in the office with him.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:27.780]   I don't know how much value he brings.
[01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:29.140]   Oh, right.
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.140]   I read this.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.140]   Go ahead.
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.140]   Go ahead.
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.140]   Go ahead.
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:34.140]   No, you go ahead.
[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:41.700]   I read this in all I could think about is just the fact that some people they they went
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.780]   through the period of, oh my gosh, I got I have to work from home now because it was
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:50.700]   something new and with the whole pandemic and just just all of the readjustment that
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:54.300]   took it was pretty tough on people.
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.660]   And then it got to a point of, OK, I think I got the hang of this.
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.940]   And then it got to the point of, well, dang, I think I like this.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:07.540]   I like working and I'm not off as a company too, as you should have been.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.540]   Right.
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:09.540]   Right.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:13.580]   So it's I think people are sort of pushing back on going back to work because you know
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:17.740]   what it seems to work for them.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:23.420]   I was talking to Queen Pruitt just the other day about this because for the longest, my
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:29.500]   family members in Carolina, when I actually were able to talk to them, they all just would
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:35.580]   they would call me up at random times in the day because they knew I was working from home.
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:41.260]   And I'm thinking, well, I'm still working, but people just assume because you work from
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:46.660]   home, you're not working or you're not as busy or not as focused or anything like that.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:52.740]   So I think companies are trying to fight a little bit of that stuff too because they
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:57.660]   just assume, you're at home and there's nowhere you're as focused as you would be here in
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:58.660]   the office.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:50:59.660]   I think that's blown.
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:06.220]   I was I've been working at home for most of my adult life, right professional life.
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:13.180]   And I remember when it all started, it was because I would send emails late in the night
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:18.220]   or whatever to my superiors because I horrible sleeper and I figured, says, I'm awake, I might
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.340]   as well do something productive and I would work.
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:25.100]   And they were like, well, you know what, why are you sending me these things now?
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:28.860]   And I said, because when I'm here, I can't get to all of that because there's too many
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:35.180]   other distractions and things getting in the way that pushes some of my work down.
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:40.140]   Not that I was just being lazy or anything, but it's just I just had too many distractions.
[01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:45.140]   And if I'm home, I can focus more and be way more effective and they pretty much said,
[01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:47.420]   okay, well, let's have you stay home.
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:49.300]   And that was and that was it.
[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:53.180]   And I stayed home and just continue to get a whole lot more done.
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:55.980]   And it just it just works for me.
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:52:00.140]   I don't want to put you on the spot and I'm about to do obviously, but I'm saying that.
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:03.420]   Is it going to be an adjustment coming back to the studio?
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:07.580]   It is it is a bit of an adjustment for me.
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:12.900]   Because when all of this went down with us and there was a lot of trepidation, but I
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:16.660]   remember saying quite openly, I'm used to this.
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:21.100]   I've been creating content myself for a very, very long time.
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:24.300]   So it's it's already had lighting and stuff like that.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:26.620]   It was it was no big deal.
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:31.420]   But at the same time, when I am in the studio with our other cohost, Mr. Sergeant and Mr.
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:36.540]   Howell, we have our host office, but the majority of the time we're in there with headphones
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:37.900]   on and we're focused.
[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:38.900]   We're working.
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:42.860]   I see Mr. Sergeant sitting in front of me, but I'm not I don't have anything to say to
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:44.300]   him because I'm busy.
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.300]   He's busy.
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:48.860]   Mr. Howell is usually sitting right there and he's busy.
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:53.420]   So it's it's still a quiet environment that I'm used to that allows me to just sit down
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:56.140]   and do what I need to do.
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:53:00.100]   I remember when the manager of the San Francisco examiner yelled at me one day because I was
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:04.420]   nosy as hell and I was looking around in the office and gossiping and he said, God damn
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:07.820]   it, Jarvis, I pay you to be the town crier and not the office crier.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.660]   Because I was a gossip.
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:11.660]   Like I see what was going on.
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.620]   Who's talking to all reporters are super chatting.
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:15.620]   Yes.
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:18.180]   Oh, yeah, I got there.
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:22.100]   I had a I had a superior.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:27.780]   I had a superior at my at one of my previous jobs that came into town to visit visit me
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:32.820]   and visit the team, you know, and all the whole bureaucratic stuff or whatever.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:36.100]   And the office the rest of the office had no idea.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:42.260]   My superior was in town, but he was sitting next to me at another desk.
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:45.540]   People just assumed he was another vendor contract or whatever.
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:49.540]   And all day long, people are walking it to my desk, bringing me this issue, that issue
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:51.780]   and asking me how to do this or whatever.
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:55.060]   And I did it in addition to my regular work.
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:59.660]   And at the end of the day, that superior was like, how do you get anything done?
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:02.460]   I said, I don't when I'm here.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:04.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:05.460]   It's the price you pay.
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:06.460]   All right.
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:10.620]   So let's have kind of a lightning round as a quick stuff and then we'll go toward the
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:12.620]   close here.
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:20.340]   Super Mario 64 sells for one point unopened $1.56 million at auction.
[01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:22.140]   That's just people buying their childhood.
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.140]   Yep.
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.140]   Yep.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.500]   It's you make fun of an NFT.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:27.340]   You make fun of that, right?
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:28.340]   Exactly.
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.340]   It's in the same vein.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.540]   Whatever works for you.
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:39.020]   So the line that everybody wrote today that fleets are fleeting.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:44.020]   Those fleets are dead.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:47.020]   They're gone.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:48.020]   They're away.
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:50.020]   More soon to be, I guess.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:52.020]   Anybody surprised by that?
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:54.020]   No, but it's disappointing considering I just did two fleets like two days ago.
[01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:58.380]   But that's the first time I've done them in a very long time too.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:59.860]   So there's that.
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:00.860]   I never made one.
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:07.180]   I made a couple, but I just never.
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:10.300]   Those were entertaining though, Miss Stacy.
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:11.300]   They were all my dog.
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:13.980]   Basically fleets were where you could hang out with my dog.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:14.980]   Yes.
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:15.980]   That's it.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:16.980]   Yeah, they worked out.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:18.660]   But it's the same with Facebook stories.
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:19.820]   I don't get Facebook stories.
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:22.260]   So Facebook, they're like, so is O just adding to their story.
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:23.260]   Yeah, it's a photo.
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:25.660]   It's it's I don't get it.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:30.220]   You know, I was thinking that in a way it's one of the reasons I respect what Jack's doing
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:33.660]   in Twitter these days just because, yeah, okay, fine.
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:37.300]   We could try to copy everybody and it was dumb and some were stopping.
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:41.940]   And I think that trying to copy everybody else is just a really stupid, strategic way
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:46.300]   to go try to do somebody else with something new for them to copy.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.780]   But that's not what happens.
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:54.660]   Twitter also announced that they're going to let you in iOS edit after the fact who can
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:55.660]   reply to your tweets.
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:59.060]   Would you that tweet didn't go the way I thought it would?
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.060]   I want to change that.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.060]   I think that's smart.
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:03.140]   I think that's good.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:05.460]   I still wish we had edit mode and.
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:09.220]   Oh, but at the same time we probably won't get it.
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:11.380]   Someone brought up a good point.
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:12.380]   Good.
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:13.380]   Sorry.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:15.620]   I was going to say, I think we would miss it if we got edit mode because it would give
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:18.060]   us like, that's our number one complaint about Twitter.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:20.700]   So if they gave it to us, what else will we complain about?
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:21.700]   We're all going to find.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:22.700]   They got rid of fail well.
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.260]   They had to have something else.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:26.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:28.100]   Sorry, Ed.
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:36.740]   No, it's someone brought up a point of if we had this feature, there's the potential of
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:40.420]   the narrative being changed with the tweet.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.660]   People are going to take the original tweet and it's like, oh crap.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.220]   I read this this way.
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.100]   And now it's another version.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:50.380]   It totally changes it because they removed the word and this and that.
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:55.340]   And I guess that could stir up a lot of misinformation some kind of way.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.740]   So especially with screenshots and things like that.
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.940]   So who knows?
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:04.860]   So Jeremy, I think I messed up the link here, but line 125, see if you can get the Twitter
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:10.420]   link working and scroll to the top.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:20.020]   Marissa Messiel, I'm guessing, I don't know, standard tuber.
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:23.940]   Was in love with a stock photo couple and she wants to write a screenplay.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:25.340]   Oh no, it doesn't work.
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:29.540]   Jeremy, if you cut and paste the actual Twitter link, it's one of those cases where I changed
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:32.420]   the other link and it has the little link in there.
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:37.420]   I said go to the, yeah, I don't know why they do that.
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:40.500]   I should have warned you, Jeremy.
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:41.500]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.740]   I thought I had.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.220]   I knew better.
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:48.860]   This is where Leo realizes that you just skip it and keep going because it's going to
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:50.620]   drag down the show.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.300]   You know what?
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:54.740]   The problem is after waiting.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:57.500]   It's rarely worth the wait.
[01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:58.700]   So maybe we should skip anyway.
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:00.700]   Depends on the story.
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.700]   Depends on the story.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:02.700]   It's a fun story, but it's not.
[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.700]   I can live with that.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:04.700]   I can live with that.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:05.700]   Smart garage.
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:10.660]   That kind of, you're moving right along.
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:14.500]   Smart garage struck me as kind of a silly story in the quick takes.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:18.820]   But then I thought about that I read the story and I thought, no, garage is you're stupid.
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:23.140]   You know, if I go to parking, parking garages.
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:29.860]   And so what if you only need five minutes or you can change the pricing based on a traffic
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:32.820]   and need or it can perform other services for you?
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:33.820]   It becomes interesting.
[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:39.420]   So they've been talking about this forever and really it has not come to fruition because
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:45.940]   the software behind it's super hard and cities don't want to pay an ongoing subscription for
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:48.100]   something in a parking garage.
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:53.220]   And this is where, because there's no unifying technology that every car has.
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.780]   So there's a lot of things working against this concept.
[01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:59.860]   It's a concept everyone loves, but it's freaking hard.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:05.060]   And also if you don't pay your bills, your parking garage suddenly becomes stupid and
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:06.300]   everyone hates it.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:07.300]   Right.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:08.300]   All right.
[01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:10.540]   So never mind moving right along because that's never going to happen.
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.540]   It's basically what we're saying here.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:19.140]   Amazon is naming new warehouse robots after Muppets as they say, what could go wrong?
[01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:21.100]   Ernie killed me.
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:24.900]   They're doing some Muppet washing.
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:26.540]   Yes.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:33.860]   I often said that Google thinks and all the platforms think of themselves as snuffle up
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:40.540]   like us as cuddly big monsters, but everybody else just sees them as monsters.
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:42.380]   So maybe this is their effort.
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:44.420]   It's an attempt.
[01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:45.420]   All right.
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:46.420]   So I'm headed down here.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:52.260]   If there's anything else you guys see under other, I was fascinated by this on lines 184,
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:56.020]   186, which I guess we're also talked about on Twitch.
[01:59:56.020 --> 02:00:04.780]   If we start with 184, Jeremy, AI voice actors, and none of them we didn't know this could
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:05.780]   happen.
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:13.500]   Obviously, a lot of synthetic speech is good already, but now it starts to be so good,
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:18.820]   especially for commercials and those kinds of efforts, you can start to imagine hiring
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:21.020]   somebody to create the fake voice.
[02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:23.820]   And it's been talked about two with with actors themselves.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:27.780]   But I think if you want to just play one or two samples there, Jim, or be otherwise
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:31.380]   known as John, sorry.
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:38.940]   The beauty and scary thing on this is it could save folks a lot of money, but the scary part
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:44.300]   is that the dangerous stuff that could be done with it because people could be so nefarious
[02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:49.820]   and say, was it deep fakes and use it like deep fakes?
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:50.820]   Yep.
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:51.820]   Deep fakes for voice.
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:52.820]   Yeah.
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:01:11.380]   I was just going to say, I mean, I hate the idea that, I mean, there's the obvious ego
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:18.140]   blow like, oh my gosh, my writing can be mimicked by a machine.
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:22.460]   But then there's also the, well, then how could I prove like, I write a lot.
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:24.180]   I don't remember everything I write.
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:26.700]   So someone could come in and be like, you, that's for sure.
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:27.700]   You don't.
[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:28.700]   Yeah, we learn that.
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.700]   I know exactly.
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:30.700]   See?
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:35.340]   So if you think about it that way, you're like, wow, what if someone could write like
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:40.980]   you and then write things that you didn't write and you would be like, well, it does
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:42.820]   sound like me.
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:44.020]   Super gaslighting right there.
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:45.020]   Okay.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:46.020]   That's it.
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:47.020]   I kind of do the same thing.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:48.020]   Right.
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:49.020]   Right.
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:50.020]   Did I really write that?
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:51.020]   Does that, does that mean?
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:54.980]   I mean, I think we're off us with the executives and we were, and we had kind of a digital advisory
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:55.980]   board meeting.
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:57.220]   We were talking this is some years ago.
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:02:01.540]   We were talking about the efforts to write news copy and especially sports copy.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:03.580]   And there was a company to actually talk to do this, right?
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:08.140]   To take formatted news, financial stories, sports stories and turn out stories.
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:12.380]   And two deaths away was the young whopper snapper sports reporter.
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:15.660]   And I'm thinking, I'm thinking, trying to put myself in his head thinking, oh crap, I
[02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:17.180]   want to lose my job there.
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:18.980]   They're right over there talking about lose my job.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:21.700]   So I finally just going to say, hey, Joe, what do you think about that?
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:22.700]   He said, thank goodness.
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:26.060]   I don't have to write all those boring high school sports stories.
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:29.180]   I can go off instead and get boring jot quotes.
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:33.660]   But anyway, where were it?
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:34.740]   It's like those market stories.
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:36.500]   I had to learn to write God, this.
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:37.500]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:38.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:39.500]   All right.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:43.540]   So line 186, John, I found this fascinating.
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:46.460]   And you guys talked about it on Twitter already before.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:50.860]   But AI was taught to speak other languages.
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:57.740]   And then they tried to have it speak English and it speaks English with the accent you
[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:03.420]   would expect from a person speaking that language, which just blows my mind.
[02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:05.340]   That's crazy, right?
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:06.340]   Isn't that great?
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:11.140]   If you look at the somebody from Denmark, how are you doing there, John?
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:12.460]   So if you go, yeah, good.
[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:13.980]   So this is the Netherlands.
[02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:16.140]   John will now click.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:20.220]   Can you please tell me what 20 times 10 is?
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:24.100]   That sounds like people I know from Amsterdam.
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:28.340]   And you go to it doesn't work for every language, but you go to a lot of other languages there.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:29.340]   Let's see.
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:33.460]   Can you find French Italiano down there?
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:35.380]   You see that, John?
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:37.580]   A logo.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:41.900]   The sir, can you please tell me what 20 time is?
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.900]   Obviously, it ain't perfect.
[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:51.100]   There's a perfect accent, but it shows the fanatical parts of a language that become part
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:53.100]   of the brain, the transfer over.
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:54.780]   I just found this utterly fascinating.
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:55.780]   I loved it.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:56.780]   I just loved it.
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:59.940]   We're going to find out next week that it's all wrong and it's not real story and I just
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:00.940]   got taken.
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:04.540]   But I'm going to leave it for now because I want to.
[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:12.940]   You know, but as discussed on Sunday's show, when people are buying the services of a voice
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:21.980]   over actor to do an ad or whatever, they're not just trying to pay for the face or just,
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:25.700]   you know, the pretties of it, if you will.
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:31.460]   They're wanting that extra that voice over that that actor brings to the table.
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:36.580]   You know, Mr. Le Porte does our ad reads and he does them unlike anybody else there
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:38.060]   in the studio.
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:42.100]   And everybody knows it, you know, because it's just him.
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:45.980]   The copy is going to say this and that and he's going to have, he's going to hit everything
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:50.660]   in that copy, but he's also going to put some extra stuff in there that I'm just not going
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:54.820]   to have or Mr. Sargent's not going to have and it's just going to work.
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:05:00.500]   So I think we're still going to be safe as long as we still have some of that human to
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:03.620]   it that AI just doesn't have yet.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:06.980]   But if it eliminates the drudgery, if it's if you don't have to write that market report
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:15.340]   anymore, then I think that's a fine thing.
[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:18.860]   It's more resource into where it's valued.
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:21.780]   In the quick takes are just in general anywhere, anywhere.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:23.380]   The world is your oyster.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:25.860]   You hit everything that I was looking at.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:28.580]   Oh, no, LG rollable TVs.
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:33.780]   They're finally finally going to be here in the US who's by the way for 100 grand.
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:34.780]   How much?
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:36.780]   I'm going to say for 100 grand.
[02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:38.780]   Goodbye, Lake.
[02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:42.660]   Don't think honey, you know how you hate having a huge TV?
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.780]   I'm going to get a TV that rolls away.
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:45.780]   You like that?
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:46.780]   Can I do it?
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:47.780]   Can I buy it?
[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:50.180]   Just buy a frame TV and then you've got it.
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:52.980]   You can turn it into art or your NFT viewer when you're not.
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:54.780]   Way NFT viewer is that cheaper.
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.780]   Yeah.
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:06:03.700]   Oh, man, that I remember seeing those at CES and it looked great, but it just, no, not
[02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:05.860]   for everybody.
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:11.980]   It's totally fine to have my thin OLED TV out on display that's not really bothering
[02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:18.700]   anybody, but you know, I guess there's something to your TV being able to hide in your viewing
[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:19.700]   room.
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:22.580]   How long did you buy your main TV?
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:26.020]   For me, it's my TV is fairly new.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:29.460]   It may be three years old, four years old.
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:30.460]   Casey.
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:35.540]   And I was after having a DLP TV for the longest.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:42.900]   I had that DLP forever and I replaced the bulb in it twice, I think, because it was
[02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:47.100]   just cheap to do that and it still looked good.
[02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:53.260]   I think ours was March 2013 with our new house with, like when we built our house and I think,
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:54.660]   I think this is that same TV.
[02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:55.660]   I don't know.
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:07:00.060]   We don't really watch a lot of TV.
[02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:04.940]   I think I got mine free because I did a talk for Sony and that's how I got paid many many
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:05.940]   years ago.
[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:09.980]   I was like 15 years old and I don't know that I'm, yeah, I get 4K now, but I don't know
[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:10.980]   that I care.
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:11.980]   It's amazing.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:12.980]   I got a quick question to Stacy.
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:15.220]   What maybe you know about this security?
[02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:20.700]   Russia's ransomware group goes the way of Twitter fleets and disappears.
[02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:23.420]   Dark trace or are evil.
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:25.300]   Are evil.
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:28.300]   Oh, was it our evil?
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:30.620]   Disappearing or dark trace disappearing that you're talking about.
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:32.220]   I think it was our evil.
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:33.220]   Oh, okay.
[02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:35.220]   Because dark trace also disappeared.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:40.540]   Yeah, so does this mean something actually happened or?
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:43.660]   It could or it could just be, did they get paid?
[02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:46.940]   Because if they got paid, they could have just been like, all right, we're paid.
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:47.940]   Now we'll go away.
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:48.940]   I just, I don't know.
[02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:49.940]   I'm going to do it again.
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:50.940]   Yeah.
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:51.940]   Right.
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:55.260]   Any else will be you Stacy before we get to our watch, what's called, what's called?
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:58.580]   No, we can't.
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:07:59.580]   Nothing.
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.580]   Yeah.
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:01.580]   Okay.
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:03.580]   Thank you, Ant, for a good rundown.
[02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:04.580]   All right.
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:12.340]   This is a moment when I'm going to take an uncharacteristic breath.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.180]   And now we're as house booth was that guys, huh?
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:21.260]   How's that was just, oh, you're such a dad gum pro.
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.980]   So now we're here with things, things and stuff.
[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:27.740]   And why don't you start us off?
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:34.020]   I'm trying to get my link in here for Mr. Jammer B, but I keep scrolling past this section
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:38.980]   here, but it's the, I've been watching HBO Max here and there.
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:41.980]   And there's a series on there called Generation Hustle.
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:44.300]   I just clicked on it for the heck of it.
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:48.100]   And the first two episodes didn't really do much for me.
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:51.220]   One was about we work already knew that story.
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:55.260]   And this one that I watched the other night was talking about scammers.
[02:08:55.260 --> 02:09:00.780]   And it's this hip hop artist, I believe his name was TJX6 or something like that, X-ray
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:01.780]   6.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:09.700]   And it was so fascinating that this rapper put out an album that basically walked people
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:13.740]   through different types of cyber scams.
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:21.100]   He told people how to get phones for next to nothing and how to do, excuse me, how to
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:23.220]   get on tour and whatnot.
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:30.340]   And he ended up getting himself a $5 million record deal because his numbers were just
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:34.340]   through the roof for Instagram and YouTube and whatnot.
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:35.820]   And he got himself a record deal.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:36.820]   Yeah, that's him.
[02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:39.060]   Got himself a record deal.
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:40.060]   Signed his contract.
[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:43.060]   Of course he didn't sign it in his real name.
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:49.100]   But a lot of it's just brilliant on his part from a marketing standpoint, even though it's
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:53.860]   a lot of serious stuff in there that people go to jail for quite often.
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:57.380]   It's just a different take.
[02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:02.540]   I watched it last night and the youngest hardhead walked in on me watching it.
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:04.380]   And I asked him, did he know this rapper?
[02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:05.940]   And he didn't know the rapper.
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:09.460]   And we started listening to some of the stuff that he was saying.
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:14.540]   And I was telling the hard, I said, you know, haven't I told you guys about ABCD when it
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.860]   comes to your social media?
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:18.740]   Because I used to be really protective over their social media.
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:21.020]   I'm not as protective now.
[02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:25.860]   But it was just neat to see that they could see that on the screen.
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:31.260]   And it's not just the old, baldhead dad yelling at them to be careful with their online presence
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:33.180]   and things like that.
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:34.180]   Good.
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:35.180]   All right.
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:38.820]   I'm going to go first because I want Stacy's to be the big banger closer because I care
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:39.820]   about it.
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:40.820]   I'm curious to hear what it is.
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:43.140]   I want to mention a couple of things real quick.
[02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:47.140]   TikTok caused a rush on ukulele sales.
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:49.340]   I just kind of butterfly with tea.
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:50.340]   Oh, tea.
[02:10:50.340 --> 02:10:53.140]   You can learn these to make musical things that would drop.
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:54.140]   Stocking.
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:55.140]   Same.
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:59.100]   It's bad enough as musicals, ukulele musical.
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:03.140]   I think the most important story of the week, but it's not going to be my number, but Popeyes
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:04.340]   is planning nuggets.
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:07.500]   Um, that's, that they're going to kill.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.300]   This spicy nuggets?
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:10.780]   I think that's a choice.
[02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:11.780]   I would imagine.
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:15.620]   But to get classic nuggets, but they're going to be mondo nuggets.
[02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:17.620]   I think the Popeye fried chicken.
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:19.660]   Hey, you looking forward to that?
[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.300]   Stacy looking forward to that?
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:24.540]   No, no, no, no, cause.
[02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:28.820]   Cause they're bad for you or just cause you know, like when I want fried chicken, I want
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:30.620]   fried chicken on the bone dad, gummy.
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:32.620]   Cause that's, that's okay.
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:33.620]   Okay.
[02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:34.620]   On the bone.
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:35.620]   So I'm excited.
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:39.420]   I'm excited because we can't eat at Chick-fil-A anymore.
[02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:44.260]   And so Popeyes, if you combine their chicken nuggets, especially if they're spicy with
[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:45.260]   their biscuit.
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:46.260]   Oh my God.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:50.500]   You'd have like big chicken minis and I would be very excited about that.
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.500]   That works.
[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:52.500]   That works.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:56.300]   Honey in there with the spicy and the biscuit and the butt.
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:57.300]   Oh, okay.
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:59.140]   And then my heart would stop.
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:00.140]   Oh yeah.
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:01.660]   I actually went to Popeyes today.
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:03.620]   I got the sandwich and I was halfway through.
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:09.380]   We eat them when I realized they left the male off, which was better for shame, but disappointed.
[02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:10.380]   Yeah.
[02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:11.380]   Popeyes.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:12.380]   There's pickles.
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:13.380]   I'm okay.
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:14.380]   The pickles.
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:16.580]   That was why I said to myself, obviously I wasn't going to go storm them back in to
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:19.300]   get the man because it was better for me not to have it because I was eating something
[02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:21.300]   very fried.
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:25.740]   My stuff over the week is dead startup toys.
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.940]   Oh, I'm glad someone brought this up.
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:29.100]   I love it.
[02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:30.100]   I love this.
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:31.100]   I love this.
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:36.740]   This reminds me of the great old site F company, but this is hardware things that have
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:40.700]   died, some of which we've talked about in the show, the JuCero.
[02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:45.100]   It's kind of a, what do you call that thing when you make a big deal of the tombstone?
[02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:46.100]   Paperware.
[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:47.100]   Paperware.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.820]   Oh, it's when you make a big deal and they make it plastic and they put it up there.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:50.820]   Right.
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:55.820]   So this is a tombstone for the JuCero, the Gebo, Gebo, what was it?
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:56.820]   Gebo.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:59.980]   I think used to sponsor this show at some point.
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:00.980]   That's right.
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:01.980]   I think they did.
[02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:04.860]   The one laptop per child, which I thought was going to change the world.
[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:05.860]   I was.
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:07.260]   Yeah, I remember that.
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:13.340]   The coolest cooler and of course, the Terenos mini lab.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:20.580]   Now sadly, they're all sold out, having done better as joke tombstones than they did as
[02:13:20.580 --> 02:13:21.940]   businesses.
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:22.780]   But I think it's funny.
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:23.780]   Wow.
[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:24.780]   I like this.
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:29.980]   So we could soon have tombstones to the thing is the Google has killed, but that'll be another
[02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:30.980]   day.
[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:31.980]   Why not?
[02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.380]   A lot of plastic right there.
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:37.060]   All right, Stacy.
[02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:42.260]   So you get to shut up yourself and myself in the middle of the night now.
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:43.420]   Okay.
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:45.620]   So here's my app.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:49.060]   You know, y'all, I think I've talked about this because I've tried various snore stopping
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:53.380]   things, but I snore and I thought I snored a lot.
[02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:58.580]   So I downloaded an app called SnoreLab and it's an iOS and Android app.
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:02.180]   Here's SnoreLab and it's free.
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:04.860]   There is a paid version.
[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:08.780]   And basically what it does is you plug your phone in, you set it face down next to you
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:12.620]   while you sleep, you hit start and it records your snoring.
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:16.540]   So y'all, I'm going to take you to snoring.
[02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:17.540]   We got a year.
[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:19.580]   You're going to hear me snore.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:22.740]   Oh, you saw your house and we're seeing your snoring.
[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:25.180]   This is Stacy post privacy.
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:28.380]   Oh, wait, hold on.
[02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:29.620]   It's okay.
[02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:30.620]   I got it.
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:31.620]   Hold on.
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:32.620]   This is going to be fun and complicated.
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:34.020]   So let's see if I can do this.
[02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:44.740]   I'm going to switch out my head buds.
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:46.900]   I forgot what then I was trying to play something on this.
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:49.900]   It was going to break because the Bluetooth.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:50.900]   Bluetooth.
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:51.900]   Okay.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:58.180]   Now we're going to play Stacy snoring.
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:59.180]   Is it playing?
[02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:00.420]   There it is.
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:02.420]   That sounded cute.
[02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:04.420]   Oh, that's so bad.
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:05.780]   That's so low.
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:08.780]   Here's something.
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:10.780]   Lovely.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:11.780]   Okay.
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:12.780]   That's my snoring.
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:14.780]   Could y'all hear that?
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:17.780]   This Stacy, that's nothing.
[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:20.140]   That's not snoring.
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:23.460]   That's like a little animal chirpy happily.
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:26.980]   I think Kylo is louder than that.
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:29.460]   That's not snoring.
[02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:32.100]   So that's what keeps my husband awake at night.
[02:15:32.100 --> 02:15:35.620]   I want y'all to know this and makes me go like I want.
[02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:43.420]   I'm going to send you a kylo and I'm probably going to send you a queen prue it too.
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:44.420]   Yeah.
[02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:50.580]   So I sat here and this is what this is the user interface.
[02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:56.860]   It records your snores and it gives you a snore score.
[02:15:56.860 --> 02:15:59.460]   It gives you the time that you're snoring.
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:06.260]   And so it says that when people download this app, they have a snore score of around 25.
[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:07.620]   Mine is one.
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:13.740]   So I felt a sense of really frustrated anger at my husband who's made me feel like a total
[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:14.740]   terrible person.
[02:16:14.740 --> 02:16:16.660]   Like I've been taping my mouth shut.
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:19.020]   I bought the smart Nora.
[02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:20.020]   Yeah.
[02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:21.020]   Yeah.
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:22.900]   We got to call him out on that.
[02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:26.580]   That's the I sense a New York Times trend story coming on this.
[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:29.580]   The snores revolts.
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:33.860]   I mean, because I felt bad and like he would go and spend the night like sometimes he's
[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:38.740]   like, Stacy, you know, it was just too much last night because like sometimes, you know,
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:43.180]   my migraine medicines, they sometimes I'll take like a muscle relaxer because my shoulders
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:46.940]   get all and then that I'm like just gone.
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:51.300]   So anyway, so this app lets you track it.
[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:56.260]   It also offers you some insights that say things like you have the option of saying like,
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:58.020]   did you drink the night before?
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:16:59.820]   You know, so you can start recognizing patterns.
[02:16:59.820 --> 02:17:02.060]   I just think that default.
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:03.060]   You can.
[02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:08.860]   I mean, so some of the, some of the like the factors they have include things like, did
[02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:11.900]   you fast four hours before dinner?
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:13.620]   Did you drink alcohol where you congested?
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:14.620]   Did you check a shower?
[02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:15.620]   Did you eat?
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:16.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:17.620]   That makes sense.
[02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:18.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:18.620 --> 02:17:19.620]   So all of that's in there.
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:20.620]   You can add them.
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:26.100]   And then what it does is it says things like, Hey, by the way, your snoring seems to be related
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:30.020]   to this or is your snoring, you know, this type?
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:33.820]   Here's what here's what you should do about that.
[02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:34.820]   So basically.
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:35.820]   So I will.
[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:39.820]   Did you take the app to Andrew and say, huh?
[02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:41.780]   Oh, you think this is bad?
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:42.780]   Huh?
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:43.780]   I did.
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:50.300]   I said, I will be, I will confess, you know, they did say that there is like four quote
[02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:54.300]   unquote epic snores on here.
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:59.780]   So, but I mean, like last night I snored for a total of three minutes and the night before
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:02.740]   I snored for a total of nine minutes.
[02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:05.860]   And that's not that terrible.
[02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:09.860]   All right, Mr. Andy, you're full of it, bro.
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:11.060]   I'm sorry.
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:12.780]   I just got to call it like it is.
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:15.380]   I think he's full of it.
[02:18:15.380 --> 02:18:16.900]   I mean, I, I get it.
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:20.060]   I do snore, but, but no, you don't.
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:22.060]   I'm allergic to dust mites.
[02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.740]   You chirp and chortle.
[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:25.740]   That's not snoring.
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:30.380]   Well, when he snores, because he, I call that heavy breathing and I think it's relaxing
[02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:31.380]   when I hear him breathing.
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:33.380]   I'm like, Oh, that's nice.
[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:34.380]   He's alone.
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:37.900]   He's a, well, he's, well, he's, he's alive and he's sleeping.
[02:18:37.900 --> 02:18:42.060]   You know, I feel like comforted that he's happy and a stupid anyway.
[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:43.060]   I get that.
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:48.100]   That's so if you all have been told that you snore, this might help you stop or at least
[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:50.580]   help you evaluate as you're trying things to stop.
[02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:52.060]   When you, when your marital fight.
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:53.060]   Yes.
[02:18:53.060 --> 02:19:00.940]   Or it will help you tell your husband or wife or whomever that they are nuts and he saps
[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:01.940]   it.
[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:05.100]   Get the app and try it on so you can Google.
[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:13.820]   Well, all I want to say at the end of this is I hope this show doesn't get a high stores
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:14.820]   core.
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:16.820]   Thank you.
[02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:17.820]   Stacy.
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:19.820]   Thank you, aunt.
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:20.820]   Thank you, John.
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:22.420]   Thank you, Leo, for going on vacation.
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:26.540]   I hope you and company are having a great time and thank you audience for tolerating
[02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:30.420]   us for a long time, but a lot of stories, a lot of great stuff.
[02:19:30.420 --> 02:19:32.180]   And so that is this.
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:33.660]   I got one more thing.
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:34.660]   Hold on.
[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:35.660]   Please.
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:37.980]   I meant to add this to my thing.
[02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:42.780]   It's a shout out to one of our listeners, Miss Gabrielle.
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:49.260]   Last week I, Miss Stacy was, was doing a little demonstration and I asked her to do it again
[02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:52.780]   because it just looked like it had been perfect for a GIF.
[02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:53.780]   Huh?
[02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:55.780]   Well, look what happened.
[02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:56.780]   Oh, no.
[02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:07.060]   Sure enough, Miss Gabrielle was like, really, you had to bait me and create an a gift and
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:08.420]   ensure enough she did.
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:10.220]   So shout out to her.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:11.460]   Thank you so much.
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:13.780]   That is that is awesome.
[02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:14.780]   That is hilarious.
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:16.780]   That's an NFT.
[02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:21.140]   If I ever saw one, that's, that's worth buying.
[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:26.420]   I want you to know that I'm wearing a different black shirt than the black shirt.
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:27.980]   It was so great when you did it.
[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:30.140]   And I was like, yep, there, there's a moment.
[02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:35.460]   And today, I think a, yeah, other moment would be when he asked about the, uh, the
[02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:37.940]   Natalie from the wall and he was like, I don't know.
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:40.620]   And then look, look at your face.
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:42.460]   I was like,
[02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:44.060]   Oh,
[02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:47.340]   yeah, Gabrielle, thank you so much.
[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:49.980]   I daughter will appreciate that.
[02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:50.980]   Yes.
[02:20:50.980 --> 02:20:52.380]   You just said it over.
[02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:53.380]   Oh, I forgot.
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:57.460]   And what the thing we always does so nicely is to, is to, is to figure out a plugs and
[02:20:57.460 --> 02:20:59.460]   what do you plug?
[02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:02.860]   I'm going to plug, um, my show first off.
[02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:03.860]   Yeah.
[02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:05.900]   My show, Hands Off Photography, Twitter, that TV slash hop.
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:09.460]   Uh, we're going to be back in the studio soon shooting and it's going to be a lot of
[02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:10.460]   fun.
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:13.300]   I got to see you, Mr. Victor yesterday and give him a hug.
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:14.300]   I love that dude.
[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:16.500]   He's just, just good people.
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:22.820]   Um, but I also want to plug today's floss weekly that recorded this morning with Mr.
[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:25.820]   Dave Tatt talking about buffer bloke.
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:30.620]   A lot of stuff I had no idea about, but man, he was so good today.
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:36.740]   He's, he's doing the show from a boat from a boat and he's smoking a pipe.
[02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:39.740]   It was just, it was great.
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:42.380]   And let's twit that TV slash floss.
[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:44.700]   The floss group always great.
[02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:45.540]   I'm talking to Doc.
[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:47.180]   I think tomorrow.
[02:21:47.180 --> 02:21:48.700]   Oh, you are.
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.700]   Yeah.
[02:21:49.700 --> 02:21:52.700]   He's, he's quite a character too.
[02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:54.140]   I'll just leave it.
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:22:00.660]   He is indeed, but he's one of the, one of the pioneers I, I, I admire Stacy.
[02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:01.660]   Your plug.
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:06.100]   No, my plug will be for the internet of things podcast and the Stacy and IOT newsletter
[02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:10.740]   because they're free and fun and you'll learn lots of crazy things.
[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:14.260]   I'm like, Kevin toffles about Chromebooks, even though he won't tell me which Chromebook
[02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:15.260]   to buy.
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:19.180]   Yeah, I still love him.
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:21.660]   And now people, that's a wrap.
[02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:22.900]   Thank you all very, very much.
[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:28.460]   I'm not sure what Leo's supposed to say at this moment, but I'll just say salute.
