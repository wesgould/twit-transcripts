[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Stacey Higginbotham and Pruitt. Lots to talk about.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Android 11 is out. We'll talk about some of the new features. There's some really interesting stuff.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Ant, find some really good stuff as a matter of fact. We'll play Doom on a pregnancy test.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I'm not kidding. And then we're to talk about Steve Gibson's suggestion for securing IoT
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and get Stacey Higginbotham's reaction. She's not sure it's going to work. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   This week at Google comes to you from Twits, LastPass Studios.

[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I don't know why I call you guys. And Pruitt is here from Hands-On Photography, our own hand Pruitt from the Twits Studios North.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Where you got the window open, you're muted right now, Ian.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   You got the window open because--
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I didn't mean to be muted, I'm sorry about that.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I didn't mean that because it's such a weird day in the Bay Area right now.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   There's a picture from your balcony.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And I'll also show you the picture in the New York Times where they called it a nuclear winter over the Bay Area.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And this would look like this morning when I got up at about 10 a.m.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It's morning.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's morning. It should be bright. That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So good to see Jeff.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I am in nice and safe New Jersey.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Safe New Jersey is 79 degrees.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Oh, it's like a beautifully lit room.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's nice. It's here it is.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   California is meant to be admired, not inhabited.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I've come to keep--
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   [Laughs]
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Now you tell me.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Who would have thought the air would be better in New Jersey than in New Jersey?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   New Jersey!
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Hey! Hey!
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Hey!
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yo!
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Jeff is the Leonard Town Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Good to see you Mr. J.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Good to see you as ever.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And from the not burning portion of Washington State, Stacey Higginbothop Choices,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   she writes the Stacey on IOT newsletter at StaceyOnIOT.com
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and co-hosts the IOT show with Kevin Tofol.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So she wore that top in solidarity with California work?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yeah, I was saying her top matches are Skye.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I just-- I got fancy today because I did a thing with the-- I did a panel and--
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Nice.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   --was up at 630 marking my shine.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Good for you.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Good for you.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You've been working hard.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So yeah, I just-- I mean, it's not news, certainly not tech news, but because of the wildfires all over the state.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   That never stops us.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yes, good point.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   The State of California has already set a record for the number of acres burned 2.3 million acres burned, and it's not even the height of the wildfire season.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   We got them early this year because of the freak thunderstorms we had a couple of weeks ago.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So we-- this could be the beginning of the end.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's not good.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And you know, the truth is, ProPublica had a very good article.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   The president wasn't far wrong when he said we haven't been raking our public lands properly.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It wasn't raking exactly.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   What we haven't been doing is regular controlled burns.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   We stopped doing that about 40 years ago.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   California is a Mediterranean climate that is supposed to burn.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It's supposed to burn on a regular basis.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But because we have been very good at fire suppression, we've kind of built up a fire debt.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Normally what would happen is you would have, you know, these burns periodically, you know, they've been going on for millennia.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And of course, with no inhabitants, that's no big deal.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   As we got to--
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Well, try to tell that to the squirrels.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But squirrels just run away.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But now, because they're everywhere is built up, the state of California, which used to do these controlled burns,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   the ideal would be kind of a checkerboard where you burn in safe spaces, you burn it controlled,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and then you don't have these big wildfires.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   But we stopped that about 40 years ago.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And ever since wildfires have been worse and worse.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   That's where they can control them very well now.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I don't think so.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   There are not enough firefighters.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   That's part of the problem.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Especially since--
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Here's another happy stat.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We used to use prisoners for five bucks an hour.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Most of the fire suppression was done by prisoners.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   But they've been sent home because of COVID.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   They're either sick or not in prison anymore.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And so we've lost a lot of our firefighters.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So it's just a perfect storm or an imperfect storm.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   This morning it was very red and just looked awful.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And today, even now, right now, it looks like it's twilight.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's twilight of the gods.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   It's got a domerum.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's terrifying.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Domerum.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Domerum.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Domerum.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Thank you for the correction.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, I didn't even-- I never knew how that was pronounced.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I'm like, oh.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I just say it as I see it.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   What does that mean?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Gator?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   This-- the-- the-- the-- something with the gods, right?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Domerum.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's twilight of the gods.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Gator?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Twilight.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Domerum.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's an oom-loud.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You can't miss the oom-loud.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's the oom-- there's two oom-louds in Gator, Domerum.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   By the way--
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Mark Twain was supposedly said-- I can't-- or found this actual quote.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It was told me, he said, I'll bring the vowels.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   You bring the oom-louds.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But I can't find that.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I love it.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   It was just-- it's Gator.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Gator?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And how do you pronounce this--
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Gator?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   A oom-loud?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   A.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's like an A-E.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   E.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Gator?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I should ask my son, who is actually proficient in German.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And it does, in fact--
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   No, that's not.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   --here's Valhalla in flames.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And it does look exactly like that.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   That's-- that's what we're seeing right now outside the Bay Area.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   That's the Golden Gate Bridge on the right.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And--
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   --weesh.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's the East Bay right there.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Here's the East Bay in flames.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So I guess Stacy, you got the same thing up north.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   We've got less of it.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   But we do have-- we can't go outside.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It's still unhealthy.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And there's less of smoke.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I just-- in fact, when Stacy got on, I--
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I--
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Pigeon--
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Pigeon hold her for a while.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   What outdoor air sensor should I get?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And--
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And I said, you should go with Pigeon Labs,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and they have an air sensor, and you went with purple instead.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Because my producer told me.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You always do what Carsten says.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Carsten--
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Carsten, are we going to have to fight?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   As we've already established, Carsten has photos.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So I have to-- whatever he says I have to do.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Anyway, it's-- yeah, the air, I'm sure, is unhealthy.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   But I thought it would be good to have a sensor purple
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   and a Pigeon do maps based on the sensors that they distribute.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   But the one reason I get the purple is it's kind of mostly meant to be worn, right?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   On your body?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   No, the reason you got the purple is because it's Wi-Fi connected
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and meant to sit on the outside of your house.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That's right.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I wanted to--
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And just hang it on the deck.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   The Pigeon is-- it's more of a wearable device that you like snap to your purse
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   or your backpack or whatever.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I need something authoritative because the problem is, you know,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I have the Apple-- the Apple Watch has an air quality index on it.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   But it turns out it's getting that from Heelsburg,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   which is up the road like 20 miles.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's not useful.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It's just way up the road.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Yeah, way up the road.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So this morning I got up and I looked down and I said,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   "Well, honey, it's red out.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I don't think that's a good sign, but it smells fine."
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So I started opening the windows and doors because I'm trying to get some air in here.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And she said, "Close them. I'm working."
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So I--
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   You don't have air conditioning.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   No, we do.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   But it was snowing ashes again today.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   It smelled fine, but my car is loaded up with ashes today.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah, so I think that's part of the problem, too, is sometimes it doesn't smell smoky,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   but it's got to-- but there's air is full of poisonous hydrocarbons.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I know.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Now I know how the dinosaurs felt, right?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Oh, honey, is it okay to go outside the cave?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   No, it's flunking.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That damn asteroid rowing things.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   [laughs]
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Okay, so anyway, that's the story of my-- I'm going to get that purple sensor
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   and I'll put it up and then-- that's why Carston wants it,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   because he knows I live close to the street,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   but before he comes in, he can check my sensor.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He can see how it's always a method to his madness.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Yes.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   There is, indeed.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Carston-- on the track, Carston himself says, "Carson knows all."
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Yes, indeed.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   All about Leo's checkered past.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Carston has a better hype man than I do.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   [laughs]
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So, what should we talk about today, kids?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I'm getting the new Android phone from Microsoft tomorrow.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   That's pretty cool.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The Google Duo.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to come with Android 11,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   which came out yesterday.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So-- I haven't gotten it.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Oh, you could get it.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Just-- you have a pixel, right?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Yeah, just go to your estates.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And just force an update.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You don't have to force it.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I always have to force an update.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I'm just going to wait to see how soon I get it,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   since it rolled out yesterday.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I said, "Let me just see how fast I'll get it."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Does it--
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Hey, did I get it?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I never-- I never wait.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   So, I don't know.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   So, it will tell you eventually, "Oh, you have an update?"
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Eventually, it just auto-updates.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And then you'll pick up your phone,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   you'll enter your pen, and then it'll be like, "By the way,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'll use this."
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Oh, we're not removed.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Yeah, that's really-- that's one thing I don't like.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So, I was saying, "Okay, check for update.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It says, "It's update.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   It says, "up-date it."
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And it says, "I'll update it when you're not using your phone."
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Did-- [laughs]
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   You only waste all of my phone and stop updating it.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It might actually offered me the chance to--
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   it was like, "You have an update.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Do you want to schedule it for 1 a.m. in the morning?"
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   That is nice.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And I was like, "Thanks, Coco."
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Thanks, Google.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I always forget where do I get to its system.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It is.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You have to dig for it, believe it or not.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   There it is.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Yeah, it's not an immediately obvious system,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   and then you have to do advanced,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and then at the bottom system update.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So I remember on the show, we used to get so excited.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   We'd all spend the whole show trying for an update.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So I'm not exciting now.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   All the new things are coming.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Oh, boy.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It's just not exciting.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The phone book is in.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   The phone book is in.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Why is it not exciting now?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I know that's not exciting for me,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   but I want to know why.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I can't name one new feature that I'm saying,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   "Oh, gosh, I got to have Andrea Landon last time."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   What was it last time?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Ten was big 'cause--
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Well, don't--
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Go ahead.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I feel like there was--
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I really like that behind-the-scenes transcription thing.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   What, live transcribe?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I can call it.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   That was new in 10, right?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Or was it a pixel?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Are you actually used it or you just demo it?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I'll use it a lot.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Well, you do.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   In fact, sometimes I just leave it on.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I'll tell you why.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   When I'm watching YouTube videos in bed,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and I don't want to wake anybody up,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I can see the text.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Yes.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   You can also use your phones.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   You know, mine's telling me that the new features include improved device,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   of media controls, my--
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   managed my conversations in one place.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   That is a lie, Google.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I know it's not true.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Built-in screen recording and more privacy controls.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   It's really not different.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I think maybe the one thing that you would like Stacey is now you have these scenes
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   that you can do with the Google Assistant.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Right.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   So when you press in the on/off switch,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   you get the same old choices, you know, emergency restart power.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   But now you'll also see the Google Pay,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and at the bottom here you see these tiles that are home automation scenes.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   So that's--
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Yeah, Kevin loves those.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   You have to set them up, and I guess one of these days here I'll show you online.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I have a couple of things.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I don't have Google Pay payment method in here for some reason.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   But yeah, that's nice.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   That's easy to get to.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Now, we're in-- it's true for all the devices and all the computers too.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Yep.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   There isn't really anything you got to-- you say, "Oh, God, this is huge.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I got to have this."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   That's why I'm excited about the Duo, because it's a hardware form factor change.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Software has been up in a week.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   That's a big shift, big iteration far as form factors go.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   It's not just another candor, size slate of glass.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So here's that.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Here's that messages thing that they were talking about, Stacey, which is you'll have-- you can see if you've got a thread-- oh, it went away.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   What did I do?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I have to refresh maybe.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   If you've got a thread of messages, you can see each individual thread.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Oh, it's incredible.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And then you can control it individually as well.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   You can say, "Oh, that's principal Tobin.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   That's got to be a priority."
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   That kind of thing.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Part of me really would love to-- and this is really only an issue with my family and with Kevin, but is to be able to-- they're on Google Meet still or chat or hangout.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I don't know what we're using.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I don't know what we're using.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   We're using hangouts.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And then I'm also texting them.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And then I'll back and forth.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I kind of want to be like, "Show me everything from Kevin so I can--" because sometimes he sends me stuff, but I don't remember where he sent it.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And the same thing with my husband.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   But that's just too hard.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   There's this bubbles thing, which I actually like.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Facebook introduced this, but I also have to point out this is a security flaw.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Google, which knows it's a security flaw, keeps it in because initially because of Facebook and now others.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   It's the ability of an application to write over other applications.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And that allows an application, for instance, to superimpose something over a form.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Like, so you think you're at your bank, but instead it's malicious application just stealing the login by superimposing something over on top of another one.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So you should only allow this if it's something you really trust.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   The Facebook chat bubbles and now bubbles, I guess, are in Android messaging.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   They are not, as far as I can tell, hangouts, which is what I still use because I'm a Google Fi user.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   But I think on the duo, I will have to use this.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   But I won't have an Android 11, so you can never win.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Bubbles are nice.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   You drag them around, you pop them, you don't like that person.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Capture and share content built in screen recording, finally.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   So that is surprising because Apple's had that on iOS forever.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   So you don't need an extra app, you can just record with sound from your mic so you can even narrate your screen recording.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   That is the feature that excited the hard hit yesterday afternoon.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I think it was about one o'clock or so, our group hangout pinged with Android 11 is here.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Something like that.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   It was excited.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   That's so cute.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And he was pretty pumped up because he read through it and he saw that feature and was like, "Yes, screen recording."
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And it just really blew my mind to see how that feature excited him in particular.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   This is the kid that nearly talks to me.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   But he had to text you.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Maybe he'll send you some screen recordings if you're really looking.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I know that's coming.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Damn, look what I did.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   It just feels like it's all smart reply, which of course we've seen first we saw an inbox and we see in other places.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Now smart reply will happen in your text conversations.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   There are app suggestions.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I don't like that at all.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   On the bottom row of your home screen, see your most used apps on the home screen.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   There apparently are better names, better suggestions for folder names when you work at the store.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Who was the product manager with that stuck with that one?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Yeah, I feel like the problem is it's done.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And it's not much more to imagine.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Can you imagine what the next phase of a phone should be?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   It shouldn't be a phone.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Holla, I know.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   So what is it instead?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I kind of like the idea of glasses.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   I really do.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I like the idea of glasses.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I like the idea of a projector.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   That's PTSD for me, but go ahead.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   A projector?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   A projector.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   No, no, the glasses.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You had the Google glass.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   He got beat up in a men's bathroom.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Don't ask him about it.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   That was scoble.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Never mind.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Anyway, projector, projector.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   That's interesting.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.280]   I think in the home, having a projector integrated in more places in your -- and I've seen some
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.000]   really cool ones where you could actually interact with it.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   So when you touch, it'll project a screen on.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   You can interact with it and then it'll like to press a button or to like swipe right,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   swipe left, whatever.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Those are kind of really interesting to me just because I don't want to have to pull out the
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   screen.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I want the screen to just appear where I need it to be.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's why I'm also excited about glasses.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Well, and you know, Android Auto is another example where it's projecting your phone onto
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   your car's screen.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And actually, this is the introduction of wireless Android Auto.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   So Apple's going to do wireless car play and Android 11 has wireless Android Auto.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   So you don't have to connect -- you still have to connect with the cable.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I think that's an example.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I think the idea is that this data and computing power that you're holding in your hand should
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   manifest itself in other places, like on your eyes or on your car's screen or, I don't know,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   on your Google Assistant.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   So if you want to -- you carry a little globular, a little computer globular on you somewhere,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   and you could have it on your phone, you could have it on the nearest TV, you could have
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   it on a wall, you could have it on your glasses, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   The computing is occurring, but the interaction can be anywhere.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Yes.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It's computing at the edge, right?
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   I like that.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Stacey, isn't that what the --
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Yes, if we would like to call it computing at the edge, sure.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I would like to --
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I mean, it is.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   It is.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   What's the good thing?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Think about it less as computing as an edge, and think about it more as distributed.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   So you're computing -- you're putting the compute where it needs to be.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It's locally distributed.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   It's --
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   It's --
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   It's supposed to --
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Central Internet.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   But it doesn't --
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   What's interesting is if we could figure out ways to do this and share identity in a way
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   that is acceptable to the user, in a way that is scalable and not controlled by, like,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   one corporation, we could have a lot of --
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   We could have a lot of really interesting words like my computer glob --
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   [Laughs]
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   -- for lack of a better word.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Talks --
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Hey, I like --
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   -- that would come in --
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Yeah, I'm like computer glob.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I walk into a restaurant, the computer glob can say to, you know, the restaurant, "Hey,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Stacey's allergic to bell peppers," and she hates the following music.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And that may or may not be interesting to the restaurant.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I can't wait until your computer glob is fighting the other guy's computer glob,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   because he says, "I like that music," and --
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   [Sings]
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   -- Well --
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   -- [Laughs]
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   -- And that's what's kind of fun is figuring out, like, in a world where you have all
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   of your preferences traveling with you, how do you mediate a shared environment,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   which we're seeing at a very small level in the smart home, right?
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   -- Yep.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   -- And we're doing a terrible job at it.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   -- But it's --
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   -- It's still tight --
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   -- It's early days.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And I think --
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   -- You think you nail it, because in effect, that's what your phone is, is your -- is your
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   job, because your identity is in there, and especially with fingerprint or face recognition.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   It's a pretty strong identity token.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It's got -- it knows all your preferences in there.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It has the computing power to share it, spread it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   It's got the radios to do the same.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   The one thing that is missing from your description is it's not ecumenical.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   It's either Google or Apple.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   It's not cross-platform.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   So I agree with you.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   We need something that is not tied to a company that does this.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   But right now, it's -- really, you're going to choose who you are.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   -- You could see you design that.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And it could switch on and off.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   It could license -- Android.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   It could license Apple to come back and forth.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   -- Carsten -- Stacey, obviously.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Carsten loves you best.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Why do you just show that already here is Stacey's computer glob.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   -- No, but I think Stacey, you're onto something.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I actually think that that's an actual description of where we're headed.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Except for that one piece where it's -- but there are people like Tin Berners-Lee.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   In fact, I can now kind of a little bit more understand what TBL was trying to do.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   He started a new company.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   He's, of course, the inventor of the web.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And he started a new company that was kind of around that idea of controlling your data.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Having a data enclave where your data is stored, and then there'll be various manifestations of it.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   That's a little bit different, because that's your data as well as your connectivity.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   -- Well, no, it's the idea of your data and your identity.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   It's not -- the idea is the connectivity is a solved problem.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   The next problem to solve is, like, how do you share your preferences in a way?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   It's basically, think about it, like, you've got to create a directory of people, right?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And you've got to have an active directory of, like, who can access what, you know,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and who can share what things.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And it has to be federated across any service out there.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   And that's where you're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Because we don't even have one identity.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And we -- and not want one identity.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   -- This is solid, is what he calls it.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   It's the solid project.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And actually, there's a new -- there's a new website.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I'm looking at the MIT version.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Solid is a technology like the Web, but with a new level of standard,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   which adds the existing protocols to make it more powerful.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And particularly to empower individuals at home and work,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   that's a singularly awful vision statement.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   But it's a single global log on.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   It's a storage, a place to store securely and privately your information.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I mean, it really is the phone, because without Internet connectivity,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   without connectivity of any kind, it's useless.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   It's a blob.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   It's literally a paperweight.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   -- It's a glob.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Get your -- Get your glob.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   -- Glob, glob.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   -- It's a glob.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   -- It's a glob.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   -- Okay, so -- -- A blob has no connectivity.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   A glob has connectivity.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   -- Yes.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   -- Right.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   So, but Stacy, you haven't disagreed with it yet.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   In essence, now the entire Internet comes down to your phone
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   and that's where it stops, right?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   What we're saying with -- what you're saying with that is that,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   no, now, the entire Internet comes down to your glob,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   but it can go back out to the restaurant, to the nearest TV,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   to your car, to whatever.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   So, there is a connectivity out from the glob that still needs to be solved.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   It's solvable.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It's very solvable.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But it's not -- It's not the -- So, it's not the connectivity that needs to be --
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and maybe I'm thinking you're being more technical than you are.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   So, that's my bad, if so.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And we have connectivity that allows us to talk to the -- like our glob,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   our phone, to talk to other globs in the restaurant.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   -- It's not just a volatiles, don't you worry.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   -- Solidus seems connectivity.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   All Solid talks about is -- -- Right.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   -- is a place to put your data in protocols to talk to other globs.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   But it assumes connectivity, otherwise it makes no sense at all.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So, I mean, I still would submit that it's kind of like maybe a secure enclave
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   in your iPhone or Knox in your Samsung phone.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's a secure space only you have the keys to where you put your stuff, your data,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   and then you have the permissions, you share it.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   And -- But you still need the hardware around it, whether it's a web server
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   or a smartphone or something.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Otherwise, there's no -- It's nonsensical.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   You can't share it.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   It doesn't make any difference if you have it.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   So, I'm trying to make up what glob would stand for.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Chatroom?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   -- A global location only -- -- Biome.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   -- Biome.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   You're looking -- That's it.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Global location -- -- Blob.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   -- Location-oriented Biome.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Your global location-oriented Biome.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   So, you can breathe.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   -- I think that's very good.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   I think this is it.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   We've solved it.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   -- We've solved the future of computing.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   -- The future.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   -- Right here.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   -- Well, it seems to be -- -- -- I need to --
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   -- It seems to be, though, there's some consensus that --
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   -- consensus that we need some control over our data.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   -- Yes.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   -- And identity.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   -- And identity.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   -- Right.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   -- Or identities.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Plural.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   So, let me read what Wikipedia says the project -- actually,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and this is a quote -- "aims to radically change the way web
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   applications work today, resulting in true data ownership,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   as well as improved privacy, by developing a platform for linked
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   data applications that are completely decentralized and fully
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   under users control, rather than controlled by other entities.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   The ultimate goal of solid is to allow users to have full control
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   of their own data, including access control and storage location.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I think that's exactly what we're talking about, right?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And the phone just is a logical candidate because it's --
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   -- It's basically your pocket computer.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   -- Well, you have a dongle in your pocket.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   -- And it can talk to a piece of glass if you like using that.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   -- Right.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   -- It can talk to other things.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   -- Right.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   -- So, I'm the first to have a --
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   -- So, this is a model for that.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   -- Wait, do we have a dongle or a club?
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   -- It's a --
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   -- It's a --
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   -- -- You go up the top of a dongle.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   But if you don't have a dongle on your --
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   -- It's a virtual -- You know what, Stacey?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   -- It's a virtual dongle because it can dongle plug into
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   anything without the actual plug.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   -- So, it's a --
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   -- It's a -- -- It's a --
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   -- A dongle plug.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   -- Are there cookies involved with this gongle blob?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Yes.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   We'll just call them something else so you more authentic people
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   don't get all scared of them.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   So -- But the business model for this becomes a problem because
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   how does Apple make money by selling you phones and blogs?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   -- You pay for it.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   You pay for this and you create a service around it.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   So, you say to yourself --
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   -- Service business.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   -- It's not a hardware business anymore.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   -- Right.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   You say, "Is it worth it for me for the world to adapt itself to
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   me as an individual in my wants and needs whenever I go places
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   and I will pay for that?"
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   -- Yes.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   -- You know who wins that?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   -- You know who wins that maybe first is Amazon.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   -- Yes, very possibly.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   -- That makes sense.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   -- You're going to need to negotiate with commercial entities
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   for a number of things.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Your blob storage could be Dropbox, could be your iPhone,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   could be Apple.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   So, you're fine.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   You want a trusted partner that you could say, "Here, you have
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   to keep this secure and I'm the only one who has access to it."
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   You have to have a company like Apple create the access mechanisms,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   whether it's Face ID or Touch ID or whatever.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And then you also have to have somebody provide the connectivity.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   What we're talking about is something that computing is always
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   needed, which is protocols agreed upon ways of communicating.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So, I can say, for instance, "Okay, I allow this restaurant
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   to know what my food preferences are."
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   You have to have that.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   -- And you're going to need data models for all of those
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   different scenarios.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And this is why I said you got to call the IETF.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   -- Right.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Because you need XML schema for food preferences.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   -- All right.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   So, your read-off bin who just started a new fund and he's
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   waiting for a number of links -- -- of LinkedIn.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   -- LinkedIn, right?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   -- So, one of those backwards IPO things where he has the
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   fund and it'll buy a company to make it.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   That's how it goes public without having a company.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   So, your read-off bin and you're an entrepreneur and you're
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   going to disrupt Google, Apple, Amazon.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   -- It's funny you should call it that because Tim Berners-Lee's
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   commercial entity to do this is called "inrupt."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   -- Oh.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   -- So, you're kind of not far off.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   -- Actually, that kind of sounds painful.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   -- So, you're going to start -- I got a bad inrupt in my
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   side here.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   -- For an X-rupt if you don't mind.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   -- So, what company do you start to do this?
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   You're the obnoxious -- -- I feel like this is something that
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   would actually be started at a big company and spun out into an
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   open source project.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So, I feel like it's like an ethernet kind of situation that was
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   invented.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Was it a -- -- -- Bob Metcalfa 3M.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   -- I know Bob Metcalfa.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   -- Yeah.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   -- Go.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   -- Sorry.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   -- Wow.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   What did he have to do to you?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   -- Holy cow.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Is there a story there?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   -- Oh, man.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   -- No, I just -- every time I have to interview Bob Metcalf,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   everything boils down to ethernet.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I'm like, "Gah, I can't --"
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   -- "I can't even do anything else, Bob."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   -- That is your hammer.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   -- You know, everything.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   -- Three com.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   That's 3M.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   -- Three com.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   -- Three com.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   -- Well, Stacy, Stacy, the good news is the blob blob is going to
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   replace the ethernet.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   So, he's done with.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   You'll never have to interview him again once the blob blob
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   exists.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   -- Like, it's fine.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I just, you know, you get excited.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   -- I know.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   You want to -- you talk to Vince Surf and all he wants to talk
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   about is the internet, the internet, the internet, the internet.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Come on, V.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   -- I know you did that, but let's talk about something new and
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   we're going to talk about this.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   -- I'm excited.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   -- What's next?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   -- I was about podcast, podcast, podcast, podcast, podcast.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   -- I actually am excited about this.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And part of the reason I'm --
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   -- I am, too.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   -- Because when Tim announced this, I was like, "Well, in fact,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   we talked about it on Twigga, year ago."
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   It's like, "Why does that?
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I don't even understand it."
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   But now I think, thanks to you, Stacy, we kind of -- I kind of
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   get the outlines of why this would be -- and there are
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   definitely opportunities.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   I mean, a plot of existing incumbents like Dropbox or
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Microsoft or Amazon might well say, "We want to be the
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   trusted storage location for your data."
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   -- Some people think of it like a DNS for your data, right?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   So you know how when I do a URL, I go to a DNS lookup service?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Think about that for building a service looking up.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   -- Sure.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   -- So there have been a couple companies that have started
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   around this -- there were a spate of them probably 10 years ago.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Anyway, yeah, this is fun.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   I love thinking about this stuff.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   What really happens --
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   -- I actually talked to Tim Berners-Lee about this about
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   three or four years ago when he advised a company that came
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   out of MIT that I ended up investing in and briefly
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   advising to light them no good because they were trying to go
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   into media and media people were stupid.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   But he was germinating that then.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   And what we were talking about is that there are trusted third
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   parties that can -- this is the key.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   They can hold your data and have the mechanisms to act on your
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   behalf upon your order.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   -- Perfect, right?
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And so this company, Infinite Analytics, which is still going
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   strong, was a way to use your social genome to improve
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   commerce recommendations.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And my vision for the media, what they were using brought me
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   in for a brief while, but media people again were too
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   stupid, was that imagine you have Hurston Condé asked.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And this is personalization that works for you.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   So Hurston knows about you, Kanye and Ash knows about you.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Here's the third party in Infinite Analytics.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And it does a service for both of them.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And it improves recommendations on both services.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But because it knows about me independently, I can give a
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   permission to say, without telling Hurston anything, to use
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   its knowledge of me and Kanye and Ash, and use that to
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   improve the recommendations I get at Hurston, or vice versa.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   That won't work between the companies because they don't
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   trust each other.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It won't work for me if I have to have them keep my stuff.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   But if the third party keeps it, then Tim was saying,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Sir Tim, was saying that his dream was that that was a way in
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   which you could store and activate your own data across
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   multiple parties.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So he's been talking about this for years.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   >> So I'm listening to this, and it makes me think of the CRMs
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   that are out there and how they try to model all of this data
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   for different customers and their system, what are
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   the different representatives in house, and all of the
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   gazillion different attributes and the gazillion different
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   scenarios that you could be put into.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And it just seems like it could be a bit of a coding nightmare
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   from far as being a software as a service type of thing like
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   this.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   >> That's why you need protocols, established protocols that
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   make that a little easier.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   But yeah, this is never going to happen.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It's tough to see a business moving, not never.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   >> Oh, geez.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   >> It'll be a pessimistic cynical moral panic.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Geez, Stacy, you have a little optimism.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   >> Geez.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   >> Yes, just load on the pejorative.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   >> You were just, wait a minute, Stacy, you just invented it
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and killed it in the same show.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   >> I didn't invent it.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   It's --
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   >> Boy.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   >> What is that term?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   >> Turn the zeitgeist.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   >> No, no.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   What is the term Einstein used for the thought experiment,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   the gedanken?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   It's another German word.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Anyway, that's what we've been doing.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   We've been doing a thought experiment.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I think really interesting.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Now, here's the question.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   >> Gedanken experiment.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   >> Gedanken experiment.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   >> Gedanken experiment.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:37.080]   to the
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.360]   But like a Transfer. It's a Madonna.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.700]   I was like right after this, I got a new German Word of the Week. That's a killer. It's a killer.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.240]   It's a killer. What is it? It's a killer. You got to go down on the rundown.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.340]   Okay, I'll save it, Save it, Save it. Because I want to go back to the good.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:36:01.840]   Duncan experiment. There was one more thing. I wanted to touch on the fan Android 11 save him.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.480]   Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What were we talking about? Oh, yeah.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.520]   Android 11. I'm just down loaded. I'm excited. What else are you excited about?
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:18.840]   You know, again, my son was most excited about the screen recording, but it also made me think about it
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:25.600]   from a content creator standpoint. There's a lot of screens that I have to record for B roll and things
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.440]   like that, where there's something for hands on wellness or hands on tech or whatever.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.840]   But it is using that third party AZ screen recorder. I believe that's the app that I use.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.560]   It works, but it would be nice to be able to have something native and not have all the extra hoops
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.720]   to jump through that I have to go in and adjust in the settings menu.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.440]   We've used this on iPhone for ages, and it's a really nice feature. It's actually in the control panel
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.440]   on the iPhone. You just press the record button and you can do all sorts of screen recording.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.320]   And actually, I do it all the time because you want to show somebody something or have something look.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:03.120]   Yeah, that's a natural. So it'll be a nice feature. Also, by the way, and this is how we got into that whole
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   "Gadank" is these features that are starting to come out in iOS and Android are kind of, I think, leading us
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:21.320]   in this direction. For instance, this is another feature of 11 and it'll be a feature of iOS 14 as well.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:28.120]   These permissions that when an app is first run or first installed, it's more and more.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.520]   We're going to have the, and I guess we'll get to a point where a fatigue, but we're going to have that app say,
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:41.920]   "Now, you know, or this chat app wants to access location. How do you want it while using the app just this once or never?"
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:48.520]   And then this I really like. An Apple should adapt this. If you haven't used an app in a while,
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:57.320]   Android will reset the permissions. So it will stop doing anything you told it you could do like getting location
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:03.720]   until such time as you use that app again. And then it'll ask you now you've turned, that's been turned off by
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:09.320]   automatically. So do you want to turn that back on? I like that. That's some Apple should adopt.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:16.520]   This is all, but so this is my question. Clearly, this is what users want. We would love it if
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:22.600]   no company owned this data glob that we had control of who gets it and who doesn't get it.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:28.680]   Perhaps getting compensated if we give up permission that we'd love it to then,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:34.920]   you know, be something in our pocket that then talks to our house or our restaurant or environment
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:41.160]   and interacts for on our behalf becomes an agent, a user agent for us. We would love all this.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:48.520]   But companies are not financially incented. So how do we get what we want is the question.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:54.840]   This is what I yell at Germans about. And the Germans just whine about, "Oh, we don't have Google.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:03.400]   We don't have Google. We don't have Facebook. You don't have the headquarters of privacy in the world.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.680]   You just sit at Max Hedram, do that whole starting with V. Don't have Google.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.560]   My back. We don't have Google says the Germans. We don't have Facebook. We should.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:19.400]   This is awful. We're going to kill you for this. And I say, no, invent you're the headquarters of
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.920]   privacy in the world or as they call it, dot-and-shoots. Can you say that, Lord Leo?
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   Dot-and-shoots. Dot-and-shoots.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.000]   Dot-and-shoots. So which means data protection. They don't have a word for privacy. That is our
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.400]   word for production. That's a better word. Yeah. I like it.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.760]   Well, actually, privacy isn't so. But anyway, so I'm saying to them,
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:46.440]   entrepreneurially, start this. Start the perfect privacy company. Where else should
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:51.320]   start for Germany? Stop whining. Start investing. They don't like to invest. They don't like to risk.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:57.880]   But move ahead from that and stop doing protectionism as a future strategy.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.680]   And do this. So I think that actually, this is something I wouldn't expect to come out of my mouth.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.680]   But this company could actually be the child of regulation.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:12.440]   So that is... Good luck. That's not stunning.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.280]   No, I think I did. So my question was, how do we get this?
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:21.080]   How do we convince companies to do it? And yours, yes, is let's convince the government to do it,
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.760]   and they'll make the companies... No, no, no.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:27.560]   The Germans do it because GDPR exists and it's the ultimate GDPR compliant company.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:34.360]   Okay. He's saying build a company around the current state of regulations.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   Okay. Right. Right. Even ahead of it. And then build a giant lobbying arm to make sure that
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.640]   the regulations never changed to disadvantage your company. I apologize. Yeah, because I don't
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.680]   know about you guys, but I've actually come to the point of despair. No, really you?
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:57.800]   Then Mr. I used to be happy. All the technology around me. I used to be happy, happy, happy.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:04.440]   But now I've just given up on the notion that we individuals, users, will ever convince companies
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:10.840]   or government to do anything we want ever again. 1475. Gutenberg.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:17.000]   Bart & Luther isn't even born yet. The Reformation hasn't happened yet. The 30 years
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.640]   war hasn't come yet. No one has invented the essay. No one has invented the newspaper.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:28.360]   No one has invented the modern novel. We are in the stone age of the net. Just calm down.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.320]   Has anybody invented that in Schutz yet? They think they have in Germany, but they haven't.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:39.160]   Tim Berger's lead by invented. I just, because I feel like
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:48.040]   I don't know. I think that the people with money have so much money now that there's nothing we
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:55.400]   can do about it. Can we just get that just right there, a cut of that, and we can just in the show
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.800]   just say, and now let's take a moment for Leo's existential despair.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:12.440]   I move on. I don't see any move on. Just say pretend none of that is true, and that we have
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:20.120]   some sort of... No, it's not pretend. So we acknowledge that that's the reality,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:26.680]   but we also say it is fundamentally human to not give up, to fight against these things and work
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:35.560]   away around. I feel like we have no agency at all. We have agency, even if it's just to stop
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:42.840]   using these products. And you know what? I am slightly optimistic. It's not going to go 100%
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.800]   the consumer way, because there are other interests at work, and consumers honestly are wrong about
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.560]   some things. We want everything for free, and we want it to be the best and most awesome, and we
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:58.840]   don't want to pay for externalities and all that. But if you look at what happened in the smart home,
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.760]   everyone was like, "Yeah, we've got this!" And they built all these things.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.800]   Yeah, well, I'd look at that too.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.680]   No one bought them.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:12.600]   But now the powers that be are like, "Well, crap, that didn't work out the way we planned at all."
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.240]   Now we're going to have to work together and create some standards.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.640]   And now we won't have as much lop.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.440]   Was born.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.320]   And that's why they're doing this.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:28.200]   Project ship. Do you think, though, I, speaking from my little corner of Goddard, Domarone.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.960]   Good to demo-
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.400]   Good to demo-
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.480]   There you go. You can say it.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:39.960]   Look, it looks like it's the middle of the night outside. It's three in the afternoon.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:46.440]   And my little corner of the fireball burning world, it seems like, "Oh, yeah, Apple, Amazon,
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:52.520]   and Google are going to just get together and they'll be an open source smart home standard
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.160]   that we'll all be using next year." Do you believe that? Do you think Project Chip
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:02.520]   will do better than anything else that's been tried?
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:08.840]   I believe that it will make life easier in a lot of ways for a lot of consumers and a lot of people
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.960]   building products. Will it solve every single problem?
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.480]   No. Will it address the red sky out there? Absolutely not.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.120]   That's...
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:26.440]   I'm just pointing that out as a, we have felt kind of despair over things not working
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.960]   for a long time in the space.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:34.760]   And then the fact that nobody bought into it was a signal that the companies had to listen to.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.560]   When we talk about things like climate change, if we want to go to there,
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:45.960]   we're going to have to make some painful choices and companies are going to have to make painful.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:53.560]   Some of that's starting to happen. We're seeing more people who are young become vegetarians.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:45:00.040]   We're seeing lots of small changes. Will that be enough? I don't think so.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:09.320]   C. Stacey, Leo and I were children of the 60s. We thought we were going to end the Vietnam War.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.560]   We were going to bring racial harmony. We were going to kill capitalism.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:19.800]   We were going to bring a global peace. We were just the best and look what we did in the world.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:28.440]   Well, tell him where a bunch of selfish kind of pokes. And I get it. But I think we're...
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:38.120]   I know that I have become much more conscious of the unseen, the externalities and the things I
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:44.600]   choose to purchase, the way I spend my money. I also know that I'm very privileged in the sense
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:50.600]   that I have money to make those choices. I don't have to buy non-organically produced cotton or
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:57.640]   something like that. I can buy fair trade coffee for an extra cost. But I'm willing to make those
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:04.360]   things. And I don't know if it's helping. But I'm putting my money where my values are right now
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.000]   because I have the ability to and because I think it's more important than just buying more stuff.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.960]   And I think other people are doing the same. And I think there are people making choices
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:22.600]   that will help. And I think we need to just get things like our stock markets and
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:30.280]   our fiduciary duties aligned with where we really want things to go. And I think that's hard right
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:39.720]   now given some of the leadership. These are hard problems, but at least we're talking about them.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:45.640]   At least people are starting to acknowledge them. And in some ways, the backlash is so large because
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.680]   we're talking about them more. And it's threatening more people.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.960]   I feel so much better.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.840]   Sorry.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   You want the German word? What the German word? Yeah, it'll make you happy. Go down on the
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:08.360]   rundown. No, I'm not going to say it. You got it. You got to play it. I got to play it. Don't
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.720]   worry, don't worry, Karsten. Don't say it. It's like a Facebook video. There's no music or anything.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:16.760]   It'll be fun. And where did you put it? It's down on the rundown. It says line.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.880]   Line. Hold on. I see it. I see it. The one that says, "Starden, Burden, Harden."
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:34.360]   Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm not in the Facebook. You're Facebook, but you're going to love them.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.520]   You see what it just did, by the way. It put a picture of this guy and said, you know,
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:45.160]   if you want to see more of him, you could sign up. Okay, here you go. This is how you call cats in
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:53.240]   German. Not working. Nabi and Nabi and Nabi. That's Korean. That's question.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:48:00.840]   Harden, Burden, Harden, Bart. Oh, John, always hard. That came. Start the hook. Not working.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.800]   Mimi, Mimi. Chinese. Mich, Mich, Mich, Italian.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:13.400]   Start the hook. Start the hook. Start the hook. Start the hook. Start the hook.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.320]   Start the hook. Start the hook. Start the hook. Start the hook. Start the hook.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.800]   He goes on forever with this. He does. He calls his cat. And only it says,
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.440]   but it can mean a lot of things. For example, I love you or, hey, look at me or come here.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.640]   It's used to get the attention of animals and it works because it's funny.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:37.720]   Okay. Start in Burden, Harden, Bart.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:44.680]   Harden, Bart. Start in Burden, Harden, Bart. And this only works for cats.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.000]   No, that's that's that's that you should be a sweetest.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.120]   Sweetest chef says that. Harden, Harden, Harden, Bart.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:56.520]   Speaking of the sweetest chef, if you have Disney.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.440]   Oh, what a what a sweetest chef. Amazing. Whoa.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.360]   Yes, I do have Disney Plus. Yes.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.520]   Sweetest chef cooking segment on the Muppet show. Yes.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.680]   Amaze balls. I love it so much.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.520]   Is this a new one or the old one that's been around for?
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:19.560]   It's the new Muppet talk show that they rebooted for Disney Plus.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:25.880]   You're telling me, are you telling me that they? Wow. They have a.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.520]   Wonder if I still know my Disney Plus. Bookey dokey cooking. Bookey dokey cooking.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:37.240]   Yes, that's what it's called. And it's so great. They had a they have the best people come on and
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.680]   make things and the sweetest chef is just ridiculous. I could, you know, if I were, for instance,
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:48.040]   right now to play that, I think Carson would actually fall over dead.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.200]   Yeah, we can't play it. Should I try it? I'm just going to let you all know that that y'all should
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:00.680]   inch. If you have it, you have to do the whole show, but the okey dokey cooking. So good.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:06.520]   This is the Muppets. No, I mean, that's the movie, the Muppets. You're saying there's a now show.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:12.200]   Oh, it's more trouble. There's a show. It's on ABC. This one. Yeah, it's Muppets now.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.480]   The Muppets return with a documentary style show.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:21.720]   Let's see if I can find the sweetest chef. I know Carson's already. It's called Muppets now.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:27.480]   Having, yeah, Carson's already having a little bit of a heart palpitation.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:35.320]   Oh, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Carson. Our work here is done. He's turning red.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:40.360]   I see it. You're looking at it through the air. I see it. It's fine.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.480]   Okay. Yeah. Oh, that's right. It's just the air. Okay, he's fine.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:51.560]   Oh, I don't see. Oh, here it is. Oh, is this it? No, that's Fossebear. Something went wrong.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.760]   Please try again. If the problem persists, oh, I don't have DRM enabled.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   Oh, is that part of your cookies as well? Yeah. Yeah. Firefox is installing components
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.600]   that needed to play the audio or video on this page. Please try again later.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.120]   Carson is saved by the Firefox, but he wants to see it. He says,
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:19.560]   he said in a chat, did you see this? Apparently,
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:26.440]   pregnancy tests that have displays have little computers in them.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:34.200]   And a guy has created doom on a pregnancy test. This is your welcome.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.320]   You're welcome. Thank you. This is kind of a meme is doom on something. Now he admits,
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.840]   well, it's really just a video of doom playing back on pregnancy test.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.960]   In the next day, what? No, here he's playing it. Oh, this is now he's actually playing it.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.240]   He was just playing a video. Now he's really playing it. He took the challenge.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:55.320]   I presume it's he. I don't know. So the reason this works, apparently, is well,
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:01.960]   as we waste our time, the pregnancy test, the digital one, same test. It's still got a paper strip,
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:07.880]   which still does some returns color, but there's a scanner. This is such a this is
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:15.320]   a perfect example of consumerism in the end times. It wasn't enough. Or you're geeked them, Leo,
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:23.160]   or read a paper test. They have now built a disposable plastic thing, one-use thing that has
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:31.640]   inside it, a computer and a scanner that scans the paper test. And then the computer converts it to
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:37.560]   thumbs up or thumbs down. I don't know what the result is. It's a sufficiently sophisticated.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.320]   Tells you you're very pregnant. Yeah.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:47.080]   Sufficiently sophisticated computer in this one time used disposable piece of plastic. You could
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:54.840]   play doom on it. Low res. See now you're so much for more is law.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:53:02.040]   I don't know. I do not buy the digital. I please don't use the paper strip one.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:07.080]   Plus or minus is okay. Unless you want to play a game. Go get a rabbit.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:12.120]   Get a rabbit. Yeah, that's true. At least we're not killing rabbits anymore. Right? That's a good
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   point. Single use rabbit is even worse. Yeah, that's true. So here's the close up.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.840]   He's the CEO technology improved. It saves the lives of rabbits. That's for sure. Yeah, this is good.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:30.280]   Are you old enough, Jeff, to remember that? Rabbits? Yes, but I didn't cause anybody to get
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:35.160]   this. No, I'm just saying I'm just saying I think that they stopped using rabbits before I was of
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:41.960]   age. But that was the thing you would call up with joy in your voice and say the rabbit died.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.000]   Yes. And that meant you were pregnant.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.520]   That's horrible. So we've come a long way. You're right, Stacey. We no longer
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:54:00.680]   we don't even eat rabbits anymore. But we can't put doom on a pregnancy stick that you pee on.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:08.120]   So people still eat rabbits? 128. Yeah, French. Do they count? 128.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:13.480]   But you have five rabbits for consumption. I'm just joking. I know. But we don't because we're good
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:20.440]   people. And we don't eat little Peter rabbit. There was actually a fascinating article a couple
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:26.440]   months ago in the New Yorker about the tensions between regulations around rabbits because
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:34.440]   they're both all the organizations are either pet owners or eating rabbits. So there's a lot of
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:39.160]   conflicting desires in those two groups around any rules. It was really kind of interesting.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:47.800]   No, I'm bummed because it turns out he actually had the breadboard and the CPU.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:54.040]   This is just this is not fair. He's not playing doom on a pregnancy.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.560]   Well, when he did the video, one was that the case to do if he's a breadboarder.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:04.040]   Yeah, he says the existing CPU cannot be reprogrammed. The existing LCD can only show four things
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:11.160]   so I had to replace both to make any changes. Oh, that doesn't even count. That's not a
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:19.800]   pregnancy stick doom. Okay, well, let's move to. I don't know. How about what are we excited about?
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:25.240]   I'm trying to find something that's not dystopian. We didn't even talk about chip.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:28.520]   Yeah, let's talk about chip. Do you want to know what they what they actually said?
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:33.400]   Yeah, I'm actually confused. Yeah, because it sounded like it was now part of Zigbee Alliance.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:39.080]   Is that right? So when they announced it back in December, they created it under the Zigbee
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:45.480]   Alliance. Okay, here's my sources and common sense say that eventually the Zigbee Alliance,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:51.560]   if the chip is going to be the more successful project, will one day separate these out.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:57.880]   But for now and chip will run on top of Zig thread. Right. Here's the
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.480]   parameter from the Zigbee Alliance page. And if you go to the GitHub, they actually take that
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:10.760]   blue application layer and they split it out even more. Oh, interest. So they talk about, you know,
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.360]   framing the framework for the request. They talk about security. They don't give you a lot of
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:20.520]   details. But the new news here, the biggest news is that they're still on track to release
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:28.840]   products next year. So, yay. Now, they're all. I do have a question because Zigbee
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:36.440]   is a competitor to Z wave and not compatible with Z wave, right? Until the big players,
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:43.160]   Apple and Google and Amazon got into this. It was like Zigbee versus Z wave. And then even before
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:48.520]   that, what was the what was the other one that everybody bought that, you know, was practically
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:53.560]   the clapper? It was like really anyway, there were these warring protocols, none of which
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:59.400]   understood anybody else. If chip is part of the Zigbee Alliance, does it eliminate Z wave or
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:04.360]   is there are they all just going to come together? Well, they're not necessarily going to come
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:12.040]   together. So the thing to know is Zigbee and Z wave and all, they solved radio issues. So,
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:16.360]   they saw the actual connectivity problems. So they were at a hardware layer. They were really
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.480]   lower down. Yeah. So when you think about what chip is going to solve, chip is going to solve,
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:25.960]   it's going to create a standardized layer for things like, hey, how do we connect this connected
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:31.400]   light bulb to the internet? It's a software. And then once, yeah, and then, yeah, the application
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:37.720]   layer. Then it's also going to say things like, it's going to build a data model or a framework,
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:43.000]   as we were talking about earlier with things. This is going to say a and that the light bulb will
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.040]   be able to say things like, I'm a light bulb, I can turn on, I can turn off, I can change colors,
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:53.000]   I can do this, and all of that will be standardized. Because right now, you actually have to do that
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.320]   individually for each platform. And it's a pain in the. I know. So I can see what manufacturers
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.960]   would like to say, look, we'd like to have one application layer that talks to everything.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.680]   Right. That's what they're good question. Yes. But then the question becomes,
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:14.120]   how far does that standard go? Does it go so far like home kit did that you don't need to
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:19.000]   download the app or like the connected door lock you bought? Because the people making the connect
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   door locks are like, Hey, I need you to download the app. I want your address. So these are some
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.880]   of the fights that people are having. Plights is a really strong word, but these are some of the
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:36.200]   debates and places where you're trying to get value. And if you're like, you know, should I be
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:42.760]   able to talk to Madam A and Siri and ask them both the same thing? Should I be able to set up
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:48.120]   Madam and A and Siri in a once and have it work across all those platforms? That's not going to
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:56.280]   happen. So there's a lot going on there. We got to wait. That's beyond just the radio.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.440]   We got our ways to go. Because really, you think that you think that
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:05.400]   globs of funny names, Zigbee chip, all these things. I mean, it's a good name.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:14.680]   And Z wave, by the way, just the global location oriented. No, the Google lovers online.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:27.000]   Beloved. I feel like so I did recently, and actually, I should, this is kind of worth mentioning
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.320]   on this show. We've finally got tired of I had two Wi-Fi networks in the house. I had Comcast
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:39.080]   business Comcast consumer. It was just a mess. And Lisa was yelling at me all the time. So we finally
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:45.000]   got somebody in and they put an ethernet throughout the house. They crawled up in the attic, they
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:51.080]   crawled in the crawl space. There's ethernet jacks everywhere in the house. And they installed an
[00:59:51.080 --> 01:00:00.040]   industrial grade Wi-Fi network throughout the house. And they thank God, not me, called Comcast
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:07.320]   and upgraded us to gigabit down and 40 megabits up. Or you. Which is really nice.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:15.560]   Yep. So that's all been resolved. But what hasn't been resolved is I have now,
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:21.320]   because we renamed the Wi-Fi. So we started fresh. Go through the house. There's 30 or 40 little
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:30.760]   doohickeys that all have to be reprogrammed. And nobody is the sequel to the cookie drama.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:38.280]   Nobody even nobody does it even the same way, even within a single company. So some of them,
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:45.240]   like, so Google the Nest Hello doorbell, I just go out there and the bluetooth, they connect and
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:53.400]   I say, hey, new Wi-Fi and I can do it. But the Nest camera, I have to scan a QR code on the back
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.360]   of the camera, which is 10 feet off through a moral panic about technology and security and
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:03.080]   privacy and everything. So they added this for you, Leo. I was learning that was within the same
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:09.400]   company. Yeah, no, that's that is that is some of the stuff that you solve. No, it's basically
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.560]   like, Hey, when we built this, this is what we use. This was stated art. When we built this,
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.440]   we were excited about this. So we tried this out. So you're going to see one way to get things on.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:23.880]   Would I be able to go to my phone, run the chip app and say, Hey, all of you little guys,
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.600]   guess what? There's a new Wi-Fi in town. And here's the password. So this maybe the this actually
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.400]   ties into like the issue of, you know, if you want all your things on the same Wi-Fi network,
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.920]   not everything will be on your Wi-Fi network. Something's to be on the hub. So you're going to
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:45.000]   have to manually discover your devices on your Wi-Fi network. I imagine here's what I think is
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.040]   probably going to happen. I bet it's going to be a QR code. That's my thought. That'll just be the
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:57.640]   way it is. There'll be a QR code and everything. Probably a subject for nostalgia. They're going
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:03.320]   to go with a queue cat. It'll be with a queue cat. It'll just be another. Once you have your blob,
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.040]   it will just know it. It'll be smart. It'll do it. You don't need this stuff.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.960]   You're going to be psychic. No, you're also going to want to take everything out of your
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:21.880]   Amazon or Google ecosystem. Just basically do a hardware reset, hardware reset. Because otherwise,
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:28.760]   when you change everything up, it'll double count some of your things and then it gets all confusing
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.520]   and you don't want that. So just take everything out and it's a pain. They don't have an easy way
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.720]   to dump all your data unless you do a hard reset. Just let you know. I've been there. Done that.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:48.200]   Yeah. Well, let me tell you. I did all of the Google devices. Now I have to do all the Amazon
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.960]   devices. Then I have to do all the Sonos devices. Then I have to do all my U devices.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:59.880]   And I did all the Nest devices. We should have had this pain as part of our
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:05.960]   tWitbit. This is this is good content. Why don't you walk around and find all the devices that
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.480]   you need to re-connect. So and now, okay, so now it's all as we curse too much, Ant. And then yeah,
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:19.800]   never the dead gum routers. So now I Steve Gibson yesterday throws me a curve.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:26.200]   Because he's for the first time ever, Steve never had any IoT devices in the house. What does he do?
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:35.320]   Oh, Steve. He decides what do you want? He want to be able to turn on the AC remotely so that when
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.840]   he gets to the office, it's cold. Because it's been really hot around here. So instead of just
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:48.360]   doing like a normal person would do is get a Nest thermostat, right? Then it's all done.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.480]   Yeah, no, or an ACP. Yeah, or something. He got.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:04:01.240]   And he connected there. Oh my god, he got some Chinese thermostat. It was only a hundred bucks.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:12.600]   And then he got a bunch of globus Chinese power Wi-Fi without a hub power plugs.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:19.720]   And he bought a sensor. He got like five all these different things.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.520]   And now, of course, because they're all from no name Chinese companies, he's thinking,
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.360]   well, this is dumb. I just put a put interlopers into my network.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:36.440]   Yeah. Why can't you do that? He's a security reporter. That is like the first advice I give
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.840]   people when they're like, I don't want to bring my network to its knees. What do I do? I'm like,
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.880]   buy from established vendors. That's what we've always said by Ecobe or Google Nest. And then
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.680]   you at least and they patch it. And then by that means still, they still need to ask him what he
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:57.240]   said. Well, but wait, there's more. So he's spent a lot of security now talking about how do you
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.920]   take these IoT devices? And I guess his position is doesn't matter. You still have to isolate whatever,
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.360]   even if you get it from Google and Ecobe, you still have to isolate it from your main network,
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:13.400]   because you'd ever know when there's a security problem. Wrong. So here's the issue. Or maybe
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:19.400]   it's not wrong, but that is if you want to do anything like tie it to your phone. So if you do
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:25.960]   geofencing, for example, you need the things to be on the same Wi-Fi network, right? So you can say,
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:31.560]   Oh, I'm on the Wi-Fi network. Now I need to turn this on. Or what you're doing is you're going to
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.120]   send nothing will run locally. Everything will then go over the cloud. Well, so that's what I asked
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.840]   him. That's separate network. I asked him that. And he said, well, they always they do that anyway.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:47.640]   They're always going out to the cloud anyway. Is wrong. Well, maybe that was going to ask you this.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.680]   No, no, I was going to ask you this because when he said that, I said, I guess that kind of makes
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:58.520]   sense that they don't talk to each other on the local area network. They both talk. So you're
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:04.680]   when your phone talks to let's give you an example, not Steve's example, but I've got a
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:09.480]   Hugh hub, which controls the lights. My phone talks to it. It's not going to it over the network.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:15.880]   128 dot one dot it is it is unless so you're Hugh actually he was a great example because they
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:22.120]   actually make you set up a remote login. So you actually have to everything is local unless you
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:28.600]   over control it from the internet. But you're saying if I'm not specifically telling it,
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:33.560]   I want to control it from the internet. I'm in the same, I'm on the same subnet house. It's local.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:37.320]   It's local. Okay. So that's what I see now was no one's in the sure. Steve said, Oh, no, no.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:42.920]   But I guess it always can things like the other issue is things like your doorbell camera.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.960]   You want that on the same Wi-Fi network because it's faster, right? And you want that to talk to
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:54.200]   like your Google home. So my hello, when it's talking to the hub, yeah, it's talking to 128
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:07:01.960]   192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 100 talking to 192 dot 168 dot 1 dot 202. And they go they know each
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:09.320]   other's IP address and they talk to each other. Google is implementing local control for some,
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:13.480]   but not all of their devices. When I'm talking about local, I'm actually talking about your your
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:20.040]   phone talks to the doorbell. I'm pretty sure. Well, I would add your does talk directly.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.000]   Can you find out? They built that with. Can you find out what devices talk over the land and
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.680]   which devices use go out to the internet and come back down? It does seem like that round
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:39.560]   tripping would be undesirable. But it's his contention because what he then did. So he bought these
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:45.080]   Wi-Fi outlets from this Hong Kong company called Ghost Fund. Ever hear of them?
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:53.480]   I have heard of we actually have. Okay. And then he got a $39. Go V logging thermometer.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:04.360]   And then he got a thermostat. That's let's see from Emerson electronic a $91 thermostat.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:10.840]   So he's got these devices. And now at first he said, well, you could put your Wi-Fi, you could
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.080]   have a guest mode and just put them on the guest network because then they only they don't have
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:19.160]   access. Now I've talked to other people said, no, if something's on the guest network, it doesn't
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:25.640]   mean it can't get across the network to other devices. But he said, it's not a wholly new air
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.520]   gaps network. It is not because Kevin and I actually set up guest networks and put all of our IoT
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:35.720]   devices on it and it caused no end of trouble. But it also meant you could actually see the things.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:41.800]   So a malicious device could still get into your network. So the guest is not sufficient.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:47.480]   So he then suggested for people who don't have a guest mode, he said the guest mode would be okay.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:55.080]   But for those who don't, he says you get a cheap 2.4 gigahertz only Wi-Fi access point.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:03.880]   And you set it up in effect as a isolated IoT network coming off of your main network.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.680]   And so it's a two router solution, basically. He's always talked about a three router,
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.840]   but he said, well, no, you really only need two routers. Place it upstream of your primary
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.560]   network Wi-Fi router. Then plug your primary network secure router into that.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:25.320]   Or he can buy a ubiquity router that lets you actually use the truly virtual LAN.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.960]   He's recommended that and I have that. And it's not expensive. $50 for the edge router X,
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.880]   which is a four port POE router that you can set up VLANs. And they would theoretically be
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.600]   isolated, the up to four different VLANs isolated. Actually, that's probably, if I were going to do
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.440]   this, what I'm going to do. It seems like a lot of work.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.960]   And it's going to muck up some things.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.840]   So that's my real concern is that things won't work as well.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.920]   What was his rationale going to all this, rather than just buying a dash?
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.800]   What was his argument?
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.080]   Just because he's Steve Gipson.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.040]   No, because he would never, he doesn't want him.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.720]   He's not going to buy a Google solution. He's going to do it his own way.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.480]   I didn't ask him. I didn't ask him. I don't know why.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:15.240]   It's pods from China from somewhere that didn't sound like he was super familiar with them.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:20.360]   I think, no, he's assuming. Now, so by the way, this is how Google does it. It's called
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:27.560]   zero knowledge or zero trust, rather, which is you can't assume that anything on your network is safe.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.840]   Used to be, we'd assume anything within the network is ours. And so it's okay.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:40.760]   And he comes from, and Google comes from, and I think the modern consensus is trust nothing.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.040]   Okay. That's fair.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.000]   Right. And I think that's sensible, especially in a high security network.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.880]   And I guess if you're Steve Gipson, you probably say, well, my network should be high security,
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.840]   right? So I guess he's going from that zero trust point of view.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.760]   But I do, I am concerned.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.360]   If you've got it won't work.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:07.240]   Yeah, I guess it is work. The problem is the benefit of networking devices, right, is that you have
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.560]   a network and they can talk to each other over at the network. So if you don't trust something
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:20.200]   on your network and you isolate it, then you're in the benefits you get from having it on the
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.720]   network. Right. And I would guess he would say, well, then I'm not going to use it.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:30.120]   Because I don't trust. I just trust so many hours and time by chief.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.800]   Steve doesn't mind that. That's Steve. That's his thing. Right. So that's, he doesn't mind that
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.440]   part. In fact, I'm sure he got a lot out of it. He enjoyed it.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.400]   You're right. Yeah. Have we did an ad yet?
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.600]   Well, we could do an ad right now. But listen, I'm just curious.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:53.000]   I would love it if you'd stay see listen to security now. It was yesterday's show episode 783.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.640]   It's titled IOT isolation strategies.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:04.120]   Okay. And I would refer you to the local home SDK on Google. They have a page that talks about
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.880]   how it works and what goes locally. So they do use some local stuff.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:16.440]   Yeah. I don't see the hello on their list. So I don't know if the hello actually talks to the
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:25.800]   hub yet locally. Okay. Interesting. Really interesting. So there's still
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:32.520]   a little bit of an unanswered question, which is how many devices talk over the land as opposed to
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:39.160]   through the internet to go to each other. So interesting question, really interesting question.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.360]   And you know what, Steve is our security guru. So I'm sure there's good reason
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.680]   for everything he's doing. That's why I'm curious to hear. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:56.760]   I feel like as your security guru, I have some questions for him about his device choices.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.800]   I mean, they may work for him. But the other thing to think about is we can't expect normal
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.320]   people to do things like that. So yeah, exactly. I'm not even going to do that. What is he? I mean,
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.200]   is he showing off there like no, no, no, no, no, he's talking about how you would do it.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:17.880]   If you were in a zero trust network, how would you isolate these? But honestly,
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.440]   everything you put on your network is a threat. Even your router, as we well know,
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.280]   has just why you shouldn't, which is why you may try for zero trust, but an environment like that,
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.720]   I feel like you should have continual monitoring and updates and maybe automatic quarantining.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:41.560]   Right. But yeah, I don't know. It's interesting. I'm not, I'll just put it this way. I'm not going
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:47.080]   to get an argument with Steve over this stuff. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, I might. I will let you,
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:54.600]   that'd be fun. I'd pay for that. We may have a cage match a little later on. I think an IOT cage
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:01.080]   match is a very good idea. That would be a good show. It would be. It would be. Steve, what were you
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:08.040]   thinking? Steve's in old, Steve's old school. He's an old school, do it yourself kind of guy. Oh,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.880]   yeah. And he's the expert of experts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:21.000]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa. Melissa is a company that helps you keep your customer
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.760]   data good. Did you know, I didn't know this, 30% of customer data goes bad. Every year, people
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:35.960]   move, but also email addresses go bad, phone numbers go bad. And also duplicates can be a real
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:42.760]   problem. That customer list you have is slowly rotting away. Melissa can make sure your data is
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:48.840]   accurate and current and fresh. So you reach the reach the right customers. Their tools have helped
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:54.760]   keep businesses data fresh for over 35 years. They started with zip codes. Now they do it all
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:01.800]   addresses, emails, phone numbers, names even in real time. Oh, I love it that they've got a
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:08.280]   Petaluma address in there. Incorrect data entered by customers happens all the time. Fat finger it,
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:13.400]   you know, you've done it. I've done it. Simple human error. Customer service reps making a mistake.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.200]   Duplicated records makes it easy for bad data to find its way into your system. But Melissa can
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:24.040]   help you verify your data. They can even do it right at the point of entry. So they've got a great
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:31.320]   API, which you can add to your point of sale or your customer service tools. And I'm, you probably
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.520]   encountered it in the past when you're talking to a customer service rep and you give them the
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.280]   first few letters or your name and the first few numbers of your address. And they say, oh, yeah,
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.320]   I've got it right here or they know your zip code ahead of time. That's Melissa going to work.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.360]   Melissa's matching and deduplication tools can help you uncover, merge, and purge hard to find
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:56.120]   duplicate records. Their flexible deployment offer options mean you can set it up to suit your needs,
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.040]   your business size, your preferences, your budget. They have flexible on-prem solutions. They've got
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:08.840]   a web service. They've got secure FTP processing. So you can just upload a list and download the clean
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:13.720]   version. They have software as a service delivery. You could choose the best way to meet your specific
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.040]   business needs. And it's important for you to know, since you're going to be giving them your
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.840]   customer data that Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits, because they're
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:28.280]   totally committed to data security privacy. And of course, compliance in many industries, they have,
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.520]   you know, there's GDPR, there's a California privacy, they're completely compliant. They have the
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:37.800]   utmost dedication to your data security. They implement strong controls and safeguards. So your
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.400]   data is safe. Over 10,000 businesses trust the address experts. And you can trust them to make
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:49.560]   Melissa your foundation for data driven success. They can even add demographic information. Public
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.840]   records like property and mortgage data, marital status, social media handles, they'll fill in the
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:01.480]   gaps that you add emails and phone numbers as you're entering the customer record. You can also
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.760]   identify current customers, which will allow you to find new prospects through Melissa's prospect
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:12.040]   database. There's a lot of great tools at Melissa. I want you to try it. By the way, Melissa's

[01:17:49.720 --> 01:18:03.480]   going to that website, Melissa.com/twit. I think I'm just going to let my IoT devices live as they wish.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:12.920]   Float freely. Be free on my land. Enjoy. It's okay. Do you have a device on your land to track?
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:19.800]   So you said that. How do I do that? There are a bunch of outside devices. I mean,
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:26.200]   I mean, you provide some sort of indication like things joining the network. But
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:33.080]   that device, the firewall I mentioned, that tracks where the devices on your network go. I think Bit
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:39.160]   Defender has one. All right. That's a good idea. So you could put something on your network,
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:43.960]   another IoT device on your network that monitors the IoT devices and make sure they're not
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:49.160]   phoning home inappropriately. Or does it maybe monitor for patches or what it must be doing?
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:54.440]   A lot of them do DPI. A lot of them are doing D-calf inspection. So it's not just the IoT
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.120]   devices. And it's very clear when you put something like this on your network, you should tell
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.760]   everybody in your household what it's doing, because you will be able to see things like
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:07.000]   where your wife goes online, like what site she goes to, if you look at that data.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:16.840]   So. No, no, I wouldn't do anything without her permission. I'm using something I really like
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.960]   it called Next DNS. I've talked about this for a while. It's kind of like a Raspberry Pi
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:28.360]   in the cloud. So all our traffic goes through that because I modify the DNS instead of using
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:35.560]   Comcast DNS. I use Next DNS. And it allows you to do all sorts of security monitoring. I don't,
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:42.920]   you know, I don't know exactly. I feel like it's protecting me against certain kinds of issues.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:51.960]   And then it also blocks malware, which is great. So I think that's a really good thing. And I don't
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.680]   use all of the stuff. There's parental controls on it. This is a really nice service and expensive
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:03.000]   service. Plus you get analytics, which is great. You can see how many queries are blocked.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:07.880]   This kind of stuff. So this is just a software service. Next DNS.io.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:12.360]   But I bet you something on the network would probably even do a better job.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:17.800]   This is, you know, no normal person's going to even be aware of this. I don't know how we solve this.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:24.440]   Well, that's, I mean, that's why a lot of these devices are, they're geared towards consumers.
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:30.680]   Comcast actually, they actually offer a fairly nice service that does some of this automatically
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:37.720]   as part of your Xfinity home or Xfinity Wi-Fi. X5. Thank you. Yes.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.480]   That was connected to mine. Yeah.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:47.160]   Yeah. And they'll do some basic network monitoring. I know Euro offers a little bit of that.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:53.160]   Yeah. Euro has that Euro plus is pretty good. We're not using Euro anymore because we're using
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:58.760]   this new thing that this company put in. So I don't know. It's a company called Arachnus.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:05.320]   There are Rekness. Fancy high and serious. Spiders. Yeah. Sounds like spiders.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:12.680]   But yeah, I actually talked to the company and I said, well, what about Ruckus?
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.680]   We use Ruckus because we use Ruckus here in the studio. He said, this is the same. It's the same
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:21.640]   as Ruckus. He's the same chipset. It's just, you know, he really liked it. Now I'm really
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:29.960]   nervous. He said, the good thing is we can manage it remotely so they can log in. They can log into
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:36.200]   our network. Oh, and you try. You trust this stranger? Yeah. He's a nice guy. Oh, oh, oh.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:42.520]   So, but the re. So part of the reason I did this is because I've, Lisa was really suffering
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.800]   and it was she's in the work at home thing. I get to come to work, but she gets to,
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.520]   she has to work at home. And so we did this so that she could call them if there's a problem.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.960]   Instead of having to call me. All right. I made a huge mistake.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:07.960]   Oh, we're terrible people. We're like, he was like, oh, we're like, do you know I have
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:13.720]   despairing? Do you now know I am despairing? Yeah. Yep. Steve is going to come over and
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:20.360]   replace everything he has with the steam powered thing. Yeah, I don't know. I give up. I just give up
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.720]   tweet from Zach James and I would love to know what you guys think of this attention.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:32.120]   In the last 24 hours, YouTube publicly, but quietly admitted to using your Google activity
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:37.960]   to recommend videos. They did this after I exposed this fact via tweets yesterday.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:46.520]   This section was not in the privacy statement until today, recommendations using your Google
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:50.840]   activity. So they've been doing that for years, but they apparently he says it was together.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.760]   They're fun. They didn't put it here, which is stupid, but this is not some secret. They've
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:58.680]   been doing it for years. That was the whole that's been the whole antitrust fight about the fact
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.080]   that they pull all together under one ID known as for ages. That's what I thought. You can go to
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:07.880]   myactivity.google.com and you've always been able to do that and see what they know about you.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:15.800]   We've dropped ourselves to a tweet scoop. Yes. Well, I'm just giving you a chance to shoot it down.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:22.920]   This was nothing. It's shot. Is there anything bad about them? I don't think there's anything bad
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:30.040]   about them using everything they know about me to recommend YouTube videos. You don't have to do it.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:37.320]   Right. I've said it before. I like what the algorithm does for me and YouTube because I
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:45.080]   watch YouTube more so than watching regular television shows and the algorithm just gets me.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:51.880]   Even if I'm changing my mind on certain things that I normally seek out during the week,
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.040]   it picks that up and says, "Well, maybe you like this too." It works.
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:02.280]   All right. Sorry. I even mentioned it. I don't spend it enough time.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.120]   Do you let your kid watch YouTube?
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:17.320]   We watch a lot of SNL and she does. She has all her Lofi ASMR-E things
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:26.520]   that she plays while she studies. You can turn that off. You can manage that in your privacy settings.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:33.320]   Obviously, Google knows like everybody knows about the tyranny of the default and defaults are what
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:37.560]   99% of the time are chosen because nobody's changing anything.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.680]   I do like the fact that say I'm looking for how to repair a dishwasher or something like that.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:53.160]   I go and look that up on YouTube here at my desk. You pick up the yellow pages and you call
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:59.240]   the person. I just did a TLDR for you there. Go to the yellow page. What is that? You call them.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:04.520]   The yellow pages? Is that that thing I put up under my chair so the chair levels off?
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.720]   That's right. Save it. You have another on pages. Wow.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.040]   They don't still do that. I haven't seen yellow pages on my doorstep in a long time.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.640]   I have it. I asked you. Do you know what yellow pages are? They all know? Yeah. They all say,
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.680]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah." They know the yellow pages. I'm sorry. I couldn't give up for a minute.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:26.120]   There is yellowpages.com. You can always go to yellowpages.com.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:34.600]   My mother-in-law actually keeps yellow pages in her car at all times for throwing at people.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.480]   Yeah. I think it's because her smartphone doesn't. I don't really understand it, but sure.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.880]   I'm sorry. I interrupted for a cheap joke. Keep going.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:51.880]   No, it's all right. I'm saying that if I'm looking to repair a dishwasher or something like that,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.160]   I'll look it up here at my desk trying to find different steps or whatever on YouTube.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:03.000]   Now, I'll go downstairs later on in the day to end my day, if you will, and watch TV. I may see
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.520]   one or two of those related videos pop up as a recommendation, but I won't see it every single
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:16.440]   day after that. It's not like how Amazon will keep putting those cookies out there because it's all
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:21.800]   you shopping for something, and it just shows up every single day until you finally just yell at
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.000]   it enough or delete your cookies. I think YouTube gets it right from an algorithm.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.520]   Google News does not. Google Assistant does not because I will search for things that I will get
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:38.920]   just the stupidest stuff for weeks afterwards. Weeks. It kills me.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.960]   And that could be annoying.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:45.080]   Oh, it's totally annoying. I'm like, I am not interested in L brackets.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.200]   Why do I have to tell you that I'm not interested in L brackets?
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:53.480]   For a longest time, I was getting barbed wire advertisements. I don't know what it was I searched
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:57.960]   for. Well, these are, yeah, these are an advertisement. These are like content.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.240]   Content about L brackets. I was also surprised that there were multiple
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:09.880]   like news articles that were recent. So, yeah. For those.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.320]   You got your Android? I did. I got my updates.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:18.600]   Yeah. They're nice. Did you see the new emojis? Oh, I didn't see the new one.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:25.960]   You can now do this. I don't know what it means, but you can do it. The pinch, the fingers,
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:31.400]   and thumbs. Hey, chef kiss. I don't know what it is, but that's there.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:36.600]   No, no, no, that's the Italian thing. No, it's the he he he he.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.560]   Isn't that something from Don Phanucci and Godfather too?
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:45.000]   I think it's so generic that you can use it. It's like the eggplant emoji.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.560]   Use it for whatever you want. Right. No, the eggplant emoji is not at all generic.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.680]   No.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.760]   It's a very specific word from the yellow pages. Can you put my sound up?
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:04.760]   Yes. Yellow pages is a pet. Whether you already have an animal or looking for one,
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.720]   sit and you'll find pet shops, kennels, even victory services. This is creepy.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:14.920]   Close to where you live. So before you go walkers, give you new pages of thumb.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.760]   I had no idea Yellow Pages had a TikTok channel.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:24.920]   That's a British one. And it's funny because now we have now we have to explain
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.720]   walkies to a whole group of people who don't remember walkies.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.880]   Here's another one. So no, that's not it. That's oh yeah, here it is.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:40.280]   This is British also.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:47.000]   That's not the Yellow Pages jingle.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.240]   No, that's a fake. This is forners.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   Furner Yellow Pages. That's a cover band.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.160]   That is the strangest thing. It's a Yellow Pages cover band.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:03.000]   I want the let your fingers do the walk in with the Yellow Pages, right?
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.320]   Right. I've seen Yellow Pages. I couldn't have done that out of my head in the real world.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:12.920]   A couple of years ago in North Carolina, they were dropping them off in our neighborhood.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:17.960]   Like I said, they weren't as big as I remember them. So I guess that means people
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.320]   aren't buying as much space.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:28.920]   You know where it's also going the way of the Encyclopedia. You don't see those anymore.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:34.600]   That's right. So when I started, let's see this. Let's see this. Let's see this.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.960]   This is another 30 seconds for the Yellow Pages.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.320]   Yeah! The crazy pool hose broke!
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:44.040]   Is that Gilligan?
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.480]   The Bell Yellow Pages talks when your fingers do the walking.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.680]   Pool doctor, we make emergency calls.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.080]   Calling can save you time and energy.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.720]   Mrs. Murphy?
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:56.520]   Pool doctor?
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.680]   You recognize my voice. Get the Yellow Pages talking.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.280]   We make emergency calls.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.800]   Let your fingers do the walking.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:09.240]   That was the right jingle. The worst ad though was.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:15.640]   So when I started the advanced local sites, the newspaper sites, we thought that Yellow Pages
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:20.600]   was the future. Yellow Pages is going to be everything. We spent a fortune developing our own
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:24.040]   Yellow Pages system because we were going to replace the Yellow Pages. Don't forget a lot of
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:29.560]   ad money. A lot of ad money. Locally, but in the Yellow Pages. For years, advertisers still thought
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:35.400]   why can't not be there? And it was going to take over. It was going to be the future of the internet
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.760]   and my boss regretted that for a long time.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:46.280]   So AT&T, which developed the Yellow Pages, never trademarked the name Yellow Pages or the fingers.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:52.760]   Never applied for a trademark, which is why there are now so many Yellow Pages.
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:53.800]   Or about nothing more.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:59.000]   But there are online Yellow Pages. You can use that.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:09.160]   They never protected it. Wow, that was a rat hole. I apologize.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.000]   Yeah, that was your rat hole too. You just know you started it, dude. You started it.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.280]   Well, how did I start it? What did I start? You made a joke about the Yellow Pages.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.640]   You made the Joe idea.
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.240]   Sorry. Don't blame me for that.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.160]   See, I was old. I forgot three minutes ago.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:27.320]   Let's take another YouTube story in there if you wanted to look at that, sir.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:33.000]   Oh, you like that one? Game creator has his YouTube video of his game.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.480]   This is from Mike Masnick's Tech Dirt, Timothy Geiger writing.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:43.640]   Demoditized over the soundtrack, what he even created the soundtrack himself.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:49.800]   Dan Salvato, which created the Doki Doki Literature Club.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.400]   What?
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.280]   Yeah, I know.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.800]   Okay, not the best name.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:00.840]   Is being demonetized for his own music on YouTube because the platform claims the soundtrack
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:04.520]   included in his videos, which he composed. Is someone else's content?
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:10.120]   He tweeted about this. Apparently his videos have been going on and been demonetized for several months.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:19.400]   Don't know who it is that he's... See, this is why I would hope he didn't sign up for content ID.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.040]   Maybe he did.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:28.200]   It just makes me wonder who was the other party in this that it supposedly...
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.920]   Well, I'm guessing he signed up for content ID for his music.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:33.880]   Oh, so you think it was automatic?
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.080]   Yeah, of course it was.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:42.280]   Yeah. So I'm not sure. I share his...
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:48.920]   I mean, but this is now a story and one would think that someone could get on a phone and speak to
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:53.320]   an actual person instead of an algorithm and get this squared away, right?
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:58.520]   Come on, I need some optimism from you.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.760]   Okay, here's the optimistic last paragraph.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:05.560]   "Once Salvato complained on Twitter, YouTube got in touch to investigate
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:12.040]   and fixed it." So I guess the moral of the story is tweet about it.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:24.520]   I read this. I had a couple videos on my small little channel and I get the warning every now and then
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:29.160]   because there's some songs that I have rights to from the artist that says,
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:34.760]   "You know what? Hey, I provide written consent to use my songs in his videos."
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:41.560]   And I get that notification every time I put those songs out there and dispute it and it gets fixed.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:48.600]   But the problem is it's algorithmic and it comes from not the artist, it comes from some other
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:53.000]   distribution or whatever, but it's never the artist name.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.920]   The notification is always some distribution company and I have to respond back and appeal it
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.600]   and say, "Okay, you're good."
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:08.520]   I bet you, my R17-year-old knows Doki Doki Literature Club because it's kind of an anime-style
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.640]   horror game written by Dan Salvato.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:18.920]   So I'm finding this thing interesting.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.400]   Oh, good. Thank you because I'm not.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.280]   I know you were.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.400]   You were having an existential crisis.
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.080]   Line 123 and 24.
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.400]   Oh, you jumping way down. I was up in the 70s.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:32.680]   Fine.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.440]   No, no, no, no. 123.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.800]   There's no order in this.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.160]   There's no order in this madness.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.200]   No, no, no, no.
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:39.160]   Stand for the brand.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.080]   I've been doing this show for 20 years. I should know that by now.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.680]   Stand for the brand.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.640]   Stand for university.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.440]   Oh, it's stand for university.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.960]   They have a cable TV news analyst.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:48.200]   They have a cable news analyzer, which is fascinating.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.800]   So if you go to the next link, you can play with it.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:52.200]   Okay.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.720]   You can see the possibilities of what it can do.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:57.800]   So this is, you know, actually, this is one of the things that has always
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:05.000]   powered. It goes back to the Daily Show with John Stewart and then all the modern
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.560]   commentary shows.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.480]   There have always been clipping services and search tools.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:16.200]   You know, for instance, when you're watching John Oliver's last week tonight,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.480]   he does that middle piece.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.520]   You know, and now this where they mock newscasters or something.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.840]   And it's, and it's for the most part, I think it's based on these search tools where you could say,
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.440]   well, give me every time Leo said the dukey dukey literature club.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.920]   And then you can string them all together.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:36.120]   And it's a fun little montage.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.920]   So these tools have been around and widely used by TV for a long time.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.440]   But this is a little different.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:47.400]   This lets you search for query terms in cable news.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.280]   I imagine it's using the same back end because everything, I guess, is transcribed and stored
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:52.920]   somewhere.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.920]   But you can do a comparison.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.160]   For instance, this is the canned one that it comes with,
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.000]   where you compare Joe Biden to Donald Trump over the last eight months.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.480]   And you can see the frequency is this is only on cable TV news, the red bar.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:07.640]   If you go to the the Gatorian started link,
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.840]   I'm on the top line there.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:09.800]   You can see some examples.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:10.200]   OK.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.760]   Computing screen time.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.280]   Oh, this is more than just mentions.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.600]   We are screen time.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:17.160]   Face time.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.760]   So you're seeing their faces or people.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.440]   Oh, yeah, this is Kamala Harris face.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.120]   So this is using face recognition.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.000]   That's interesting.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.680]   Compare Kamala to Elizabeth Warren, for instance,
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.080]   filtering by face tags.
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.440]   So there's a lot more male faces on cable news than there are female faces.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.200]   About 50% more.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.000]   That's interesting.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:39.880]   Not a surprise.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.440]   Male presenters also outnumbering female presenters.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:48.840]   Yeah, this is kind of this is like that Google book tool.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.840]   Here's yeah, exactly.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.800]   So here's Kamala Harris on the three cable networks, which is interesting.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:55.400]   OK.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.520]   So.
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:56.680]   So.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.320]   One four number.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.280]   So BC, obviously.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.520]   Yeah, CNN, which is orange.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:04.360]   I can't tell it's hard to read.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.480]   Yeah, actually, I think if you change the date, it'll make it easier to read.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.760]   OK, make it more recent.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.920]   Yeah, it goes back to 2010.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.840]   Let's let's go.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.520]   Let's do something a little more recent.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.640]   Invalid date.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.600]   Come on, be patient.
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:19.240]   I'm getting there.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.640]   He's an old man, you know.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.400]   You can't type that fast.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:24.120]   So there you go.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.640]   This is in the last nine months.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:26.840]   Um.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:31.240]   Orange is just Kamala.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.920]   Oh, this is all Kamala Harris.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.320]   I see.
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.960]   Well, so so orange is MSNBC.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.800]   But this is you would have expected this was more than CNN.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.080]   Oh, CNN is very low.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:47.080]   So the idea would be you detect bias or favoritism.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.920]   Perhaps.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.840]   Spin.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:51.880]   Spin.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.960]   Here's.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.040]   Yeah, I know.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:59.800]   Here's Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.560]   Uh, CNN Fox and the miss.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:04.920]   Yeah, Hillary Clinton, an email.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.360]   An email and not mentioned at all on anything but.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.560]   Uh, MSNBC for the last.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.080]   Did I do something wrong?
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.840]   Yeah, I think you did.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.160]   I don't know what you did.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.040]   Oh, it's only Fox.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:19.000]   You gotta change the date again.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:19.960]   It's only Fox.
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:20.920]   Look at that.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.040]   That's all Fox.
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.120]   MSNBC until March 2020.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.280]   CNN, not at all.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:26.600]   Okay.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.880]   Video club.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:28.600]   That's interesting.
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:30.600]   I like that.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.440]   This is the kind of thing you teach your students, right?
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.200]   For data driven journalism.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.880]   Whatever I put in here isn't showing up in the news, believe it or not.
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:44.200]   Is this only dealing with the political side of things?
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:44.680]   I don't know.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:45.640]   What like what are you putting in?
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:48.200]   I put in the Yokey literature club.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.240]   No.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.280]   I just see.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.000]   I'll just put in.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.720]   That's good.
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:51.720]   Right.
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.560]   Farve and it doesn't come up with anything.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.520]   I'll put in Twitter and it didn't come up with anything.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:57.320]   That's weird.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:59.400]   Well, did I say name Twitter?
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:05.480]   Because I think name is for the database of just proper named entities.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:10.920]   And I put in Twitter or capital T for name.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.360]   They'll put it in human names.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.480]   Okay.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.240]   Jack.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.120]   It's cable news.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.960]   It's not sports.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.800]   Mark Zuckerberg is a little more.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.840]   That's definitely been in the news.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:26.840]   Yeah, that'd work too.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.480]   Let's try that.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.640]   I'm bored.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.480]   Okay.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.280]   Just saying.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.120]   I just wanted to see if this thing would work.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.240]   You know, it's.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.200]   We've got to be in depth.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:40.920]   Better driven.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.960]   But it's not about.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:42.440]   Hold on.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.560]   It's not working.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.560]   Oh, you broke it.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.680]   See, it's not going to be broken.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.480]   Well, it actually suggested Zuckerberg.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.720]   So that's not a bad thing.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.880]   There we go.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:01.720]   Do you ever any of you ever get seeds in the mail unsolicited seeds from China?
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.520]   No, I have not.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:02.920]   I have not.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:03.240]   Right.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.600]   That was kind of a thing, right?
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.640]   It was at one time.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:14.280]   Never figured out what it was, but apparently it was Chinese companies mailing seeds to random
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.320]   Americans.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:21.800]   The thought maybe it had to do with this thing on Amazon where they would send you
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.720]   seeds and then you'd be a verified buyer.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:30.120]   Then they could put a review in Amazon is now banned foreign sales of plants.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:36.520]   Not because they're phony reviews, but because it's a threat to US agriculture.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:43.080]   The US and other countries, according to Engadget, have been dealing with a wave of
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.240]   strange, unexpected seed shipments all summer.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.320]   The Wall Street Journal has learned that Amazon's banned all sales of foreign plants and seeds in
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:58.920]   the US, whether they're imports or sales inside the country by non-US residents to protect our
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.280]   customers and enhance the customer experience.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.400]   Amazon did not explain why.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:12.120]   Tens of thousands of Americans received mysterious seed shipments in the past few months.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.520]   Most have been post-marchists coming from China.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.920]   Often falsely labeled as another product.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.120]   At least some of them were potentially harmful to US agriculture, including
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.640]   noxious weeds, plant diseases, and even pests.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:38.600]   But it's not considered by the US to be a new kind of a tech, a seed attack.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:48.440]   It's actually a brushing scam where vendors pay people to order cheap products and write bogus
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.960]   reviews to spur sales.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:56.840]   Amazon maintains seed deliveries from its site where real orders delayed to COVID-19.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:06.440]   We've learned a new word, "brushes" or "brushing", which is phony reviews on Amazon.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.880]   Maybe that's why these seeds were going out.
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.240]   Vocabulary time.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.240]   What's the German for brushing?
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.880]   I have no idea.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.040]   No, there's no word.
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:30.680]   Amazon is filled with fake reviews according to CNBC, and it's getting harder to spot them.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:36.600]   It's Katie School of Writing on CNBC about Amazon's fake reviews problem.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.680]   I think we've known about this for some time.
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.200]   We're not the normals.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.960]   Speak for yourself, Mr. Head.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:48.200]   I think normal people are aware of it.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:53.160]   When you go to the wire cutter, a lot of them talk about how they determine
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:58.280]   the difference between the fake reviews or they use fake spot fake.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:06.200]   In July, UCLA and USC released a study that found more than 20 fake review-related
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.240]   Facebook groups.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:14.840]   They solicit on Facebook bad actors solicit paid positive reviews to bots and click
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:18.200]   farms that upvote negative reviews to take out the competition.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:28.920]   In these 20 fake review groups of 16,000 members each, in more than 560 posts each day,
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:35.320]   sellers offered a refund or payment for a positive review, usually about $6.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.240]   That's why it's harder to spot them.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.840]   It's one thing when the company itself writes them they're always too glowing
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.080]   or the negative review that's always too negative because it's a competitor.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:51.080]   But these are normal people getting paid $6 in a free product to review something.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:59.880]   I think this is an issue because I tell you, Amazon reviews are a very useful tool.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:09.160]   Amazon told CNBC it uses "Powerful Machine Learning Tools and Skilled Investigators to
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:17.560]   analyze over 10 million new reviews every week, 10 million aiming to stop abusive reviews before
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.600]   they're ever published."
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:25.960]   The company recently removed 20,000 reviews after an investigation found that the top Amazon
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:28.600]   reviewers in the UK were engaging in fraud.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.840]   So maybe you shouldn't be trusting those Amazon reviews.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:35.560]   They certainly have gotten less trustworthy.
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.240]   I think we'd agree on that.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:42.840]   They 100% have, which is such a shame because I can't trust Amazon's...
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:46.520]   Amazon choice is stupid.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.840]   Yeah, that's just random.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:52.280]   Maybe Amazon makes it or...
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.280]   That's the Benedict Evans piece actually.
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:00.520]   Amazon's profits AWS and advertising.
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.680]   What is Amazon's real business?
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:06.040]   I love this graph.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.480]   So this is Amazon...
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:08.920]   Is anything that makes the money.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.360]   Yeah, that's their real business.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.720]   So this is Amazon's revenue versus profit.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.240]   And the revenue...
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.240]   This is the hot evidence column.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:18.200]   So it's going to go into detail.
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:18.920]   It's really good.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920]   And this is in billions.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:30.200]   So from 1995 to 2019, from zero all the way up to almost 300 billion dollars in revenue.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.120]   But look how flat profit is.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.000]   It's almost always zero, just a little bit above zero.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.520]   Wouldn't you want to make more profit?
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.920]   No, because you want to invest in the future.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:45.400]   You've got a lot of time.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.480]   It's not the long-related thing that Amazon, right?
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.120]   Well, or do you think they're hiding profits?
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.440]   I was going to say, let's talk about taxes.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:59.960]   Yeah, you don't pay taxes on revenue.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.560]   You pay taxes on profit, right?
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.720]   So...
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.000]   Depends on where you are.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.960]   In Washington state, you pay a business tax on revenue, which is...
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.240]   Crazy.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:09.880]   Okay.
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:11.800]   Did you know that when you decided to move there?
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.240]   I didn't.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:15.480]   But it's okay because I have a high margin business.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.280]   But man, I'm glad I don't have a low margin business because that would kill me.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:24.280]   The closer your revenue is, your profit is your revenue, the more equitable that tax is.
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.040]   But if you're like Amazon with a low profit and a high revenue, maybe that's why Washington
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:28.760]   state does that.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.400]   Because they don't have a state income tax.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.080]   We do not.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.360]   The money's got to come from somewhere.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.760]   If you don't have an income tax, you're taxing somewhere.
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.160]   So that's smart of them, right?
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:47.720]   They have some large companies, perhaps, in the state that very rarely declare profit,
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.880]   but often have about $300 billion revenue as an example.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:55.160]   Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.040]   I wonder when that came into being and how...
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:01.800]   Although then you would think, "Well, no, you'd still want to optimize revenue."
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.760]   I don't know.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.240]   I don't know.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.040]   I'm not a tech lawyer.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.000]   This is a good article, but I don't think...
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:13.720]   I don't know if I could boil this down into less than a half hour.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.400]   No, but you keep going.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:20.200]   So what he's saying is that one analysis here, AWS,
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:20.920]   is like the old...
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.080]   Looks like it's the whole profit of Amazon.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:23.880]   Their web service.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.440]   It's not.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:27.240]   And the way it works out, the way he tries to cut it up,
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:31.960]   e-commerce is now only half of Amazon revenue, which is fascinating.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:38.840]   But e-commerce from the selling other stuff is about as much as selling Amazon stuff,
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:39.640]   which is a big deal.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.080]   It's a big major part of the business.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:46.040]   That was a big story that half of Amazon's revenue comes from third-party sellers.
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.800]   That's a big part of the business.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.480]   And Amazon under accounting rules does not report the gross sales.
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:56.760]   It only reports its own sales and its fee for outside sales.
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.240]   So we don't know what the outside sales gross revenue is.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.280]   Total gross sales.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.440]   It would be pretty, friggin' impressive.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:03.480]   Oh, interesting.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.000]   That's smart.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.280]   You don't want to raise any...
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.960]   Get any attention for the total amount of selling you're doing.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.760]   And so then the advertising piece is growing quietly and rapidly.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:23.320]   And that's interesting because it really is taking away from Google and Facebook.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:31.400]   Amazon's ad business probably covers operating income and could be plausibly close to what
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.520]   everybody says is they're big cash cow Amazon web services.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.160]   Amazon is not one... So he says close to six years ago,
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.440]   I wrote a pretty popular essay about Amazon's business at the time.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:48.280]   Quote, "Why Amazon has no profits that made two points.
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.880]   First Amazon is not one business.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.640]   It's many different businesses at all different stages of maturity and profitability."
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:58.920]   The more established obviously the more profitable others are new and in a loss...
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.320]   early the loss startup phase.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:06.040]   But because Amazon doesn't break it out, you can't see from the outside.
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.360]   Because it's all gets aggregated into one pool and then reinvested.
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:16.840]   Amazon is not a loss making business that will eventually have to raise prices to make money.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.600]   Rather, this is important.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.240]   It's many businesses leveraging a common platform and a common balance sheet.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:26.920]   So that's actually a good insight.
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:32.360]   The second is Amazon is run not for net income, not for profit, but for cash.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.760]   He's always said that.
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.160]   Bezos has always said he runs it for trailing 12 months absolute free cash flow.
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.880]   Let's not forget he's a hedge fund quant.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.800]   That's where he came from.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:51.240]   And he's always seen this not as a traditional business, but as almost a derivative.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:55.320]   It's a sophisticated financial instrument.
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.200]   That's really interesting way to say it.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:01.960]   Yeah, I think that that's how he thinks and that's his genius, isn't it?
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.400]   It's had positive cash flow since 2002, 18 years.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:12.760]   So when you are looking at charts based on operating income, not cash flow,
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:16.840]   you're not seeing what's really going on.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.880]   Why does he, so this is the question.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.080]   Why does he run it that way?
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.800]   Why is he running it for cash flow?
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:27.160]   Why is he trying to, so that he can invest in new businesses?
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:31.800]   That cash flow, he creates established businesses, which then generate cash
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:34.360]   that he pushes forward into the new businesses.
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.240]   So it's a giant growth enterprise.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.760]   You could almost call it a pyramid scheme, but all of the,
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.880]   But it's his own pyramid.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:42.760]   But it's his own pyramid.
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.080]   So he's not tricking anybody.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:48.840]   But it's why the warehouse workers are paid so less because it's
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.800]   Well, I don't know about that.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:53.320]   I don't know if there's any excuse for that when you're running that much money.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.680]   I don't know if there's any excuse for that.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:58.040]   Well, and then they also,
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.640]   if you think about it from that perspective, all of the data and insights that they derive,
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:07.400]   from running all these businesses, they get to actually
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:12.680]   use those to plow into businesses that they know will generate more cash.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.440]   So it's a virtuous cycle.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:21.240]   The other thing that's interesting there, and I don't know if this is antitrust,
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:24.920]   but it's kind of, someone brought this up and I've been thinking about it a lot.
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:32.520]   In the IoT space, for example, most connected devices are built on Amazon's cloud or maybe
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:35.960]   Google's cloud and they pay into Amazon, right?
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:41.320]   Amazon has tons of devices that are kind of subsidized by their cloud business,
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.320]   in the sense that they don't have the ongoing cloud costs or they do, but
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:51.080]   They're charged, internal charges are made, but you're right.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:51.320]   Right.
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:57.000]   So that becomes really interesting when you think about companies that are starting out,
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.600]   and I've seen companies fail and it's not just because they couldn't pay their cloud bills,
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:09.400]   but it's a really interesting question about the advantage that having your own cloud
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:16.440]   gives to Amazon and Google's devices, for example, that other products don't necessarily have.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.120]   So I don't know.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:18.840]   I was thinking about this.
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:23.960]   Stacey, to make your point, if we go to my middle number, I'm going to sacrifice a number,
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:30.440]   and the ultra of Stacey, you have estimates of tech company cloud spending.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.440]   Oh, there's a chart.
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:43.000]   So Netflix estimated 500, what is this, 500 million a year?
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.480]   They're the biggest.
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:46.760]   Right.
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:50.360]   Snapchat at 300, which is amazing.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.000]   TikTok was on Google.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.760]   Snapchat.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.280]   This is not Amazon.
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:56.840]   This is cloud.
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.040]   I was like, they're a GCP customer.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:00.280]   Okay.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:00.520]   Sorry.
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:00.760]   Go ahead.
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.840]   Netflix is AWS.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.840]   Palantir.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.840]   Right under fourth here, snowflake.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:11.240]   What the hell?
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.480]   That's actually the new database.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:19.240]   Om wrote about that this morning, and we just learned that Warren Buffett put a quarter of a
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:25.880]   billion dollars into it, which is the first time I think ever that the, what do they call them?
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:31.640]   The oracle of Omaha has ever put money into a startup.
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.800]   He usually invests in established.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:33.960]   Right.
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:35.720]   No, he wants old ice cream places.
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.120]   Right.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:41.400]   Snowflake is a big cloud company, but it's about data insights.
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:41.560]   Right.
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:42.120]   Stacey.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.720]   It's data warehousing.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:47.560]   I think part of it's cache is because it's Bob Buglia.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.360]   Right.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.040]   And...
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:51.800]   And Om was raving about him.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:58.040]   He's done a lot of really, he was at Microsoft.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.800]   He was, he was something else.
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.000]   Om's...
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.400]   Juniper.
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.960]   Om's piece is a buffet of snowflake.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:11.880]   Is a big deal.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.080]   Storage isn't...
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:15.960]   Interesting.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:20.360]   Storage isn't sexy, but those companies can do super well because everything...
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:20.840]   Exactly.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.200]   We're only generating more data.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.760]   They do it all on AWS.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.520]   Yeah, but they're...
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:27.160]   Snowflake, right?
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.560]   They...
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.040]   Yes.
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:30.360]   What are they adding?
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.480]   What value do they add?
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.280]   Manage.
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:35.960]   Software and smarts on top of it so you get the right data at the right time.
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.400]   It's managed.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.040]   Let's see.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.760]   So we're used to that.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.720]   This is what Om writes.
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:45.800]   We're used to that when you buy Dropbox or OneDrive or iCloud.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:46.360]   We're used to that.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:47.720]   It's managed cloud services.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:50.040]   But usually when companies buy cloud storage,
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:54.840]   they're not buying the management as well.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.320]   Snowflake is basically giving the same kind of managed cloud services.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.640]   We're used to as consumers for big companies.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.120]   And part of the problem, and one of the reasons I'm sure that
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:11.000]   you're seeing a quarter of a billion investment from Berkshire Hathaway
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:19.800]   and a quarter of a billion from Salesforce Ventures is because cloud is really taking off.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:22.600]   And there are the people...
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:25.560]   The really sweet spot at this point is people who are saying,
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:26.840]   "I can't trust the cloud.
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:30.200]   I don't want to put my data in the cloud.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.800]   I don't feel like it's safe in the cloud.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:33.240]   I'd prefer on-prem storage."
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:42.120]   So they're competing with Amazon Redshift and Google's BigQuery and Azure SQL on Microsoft.
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:51.240]   But according to Om, it's Frank Slootman, the CEO, who was from ServiceNow,
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.840]   I think was the company you were trying to remember.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:58.760]   But also that this is a hot category.
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:04.920]   Yeah, their sales, their revenue increased two and a half times.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:05.880]   They're still losing money.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.240]   They're not making money.
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:09.560]   Yeah, you can't make money in public.
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:10.360]   Right.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:15.160]   So Om says, and I think this is really kind of...
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:16.840]   I would agree with him on this.
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:21.240]   We're experiencing an historic shift away from a traditional industrial economy
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.400]   to one with a digital heartbeat.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:26.760]   And so you're seeing somebody like Berkshire who says,
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:32.280]   "I want to buy Dairy Queen McDonald's and C's candy," saying, "You know what?
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.040]   All of the growth is shifting in another direction."
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:37.720]   He's late on that.
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:38.360]   Did he just get rid of him?
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:38.600]   He is.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:39.800]   He's late.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:41.800]   He's like, "Really? That's what he does.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.560]   He just got rid of a bunch of banking, right?"
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.160]   Yeah, he did.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.520]   He's a little late on it, but he's not too late.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.080]   I don't think...
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.240]   So that's...
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.760]   Especially because of Covid, right?
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:53.960]   Especially because of Covid.
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.960]   I think if anything...
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:56.600]   Yes.
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:57:01.800]   If anything, Covid has made the big tech companies more powerful and more profitable.
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:04.120]   That's why Apple hit $2 trillion.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:07.480]   That's why Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the history of mankind.
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.480]   It's because of Covid.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:13.080]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:13.640]   So I think...
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:14.440]   Yeah, snowflake.
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:15.560]   So let's go back to this.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:20.200]   So that's why snowflake is way up there in the top six.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:21.160]   Then Pinterest...
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.960]   Pinterest, who would think that's still so big?
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:26.040]   So here's the...
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:28.280]   I don't know whether it lists all inclusive or not, but...
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.360]   Here's the Google Cloud portion of Snapchat.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:31.800]   So really, if you had those...
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.760]   The Snapchat plus the Google Cloud part of Snapchat.
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:35.240]   Oh.
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:38.120]   Now your stack gets up there to the Netflix size.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.200]   Lift, slack.
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.360]   By the way, slack.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:43.480]   We love slack larger.
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:46.120]   Slack's stock is tumbling because slack...
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:50.680]   Of all of the big messaging platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.760]   has not grown during Covid.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.400]   The relevant...
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.680]   It comes on using it constantly.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:58.840]   Yeah, but that's the point is that maybe the competitors are starting to outpace them.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.520]   Data dog.
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:02.520]   Sumo logic.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.240]   If you did log...
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:04.680]   Data dog does log...
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.400]   Like log...
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.800]   It's like Splunk.
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:08.600]   Splunk.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.520]   Analyzes log files.
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:10.760]   Right.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:14.840]   So you know what's interesting and what you'll see is
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:19.160]   there's two factors that are happening that are important to note with your biggest spenders.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:20.760]   Video and imagery.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:21.240]   Yep.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.120]   Right.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:27.160]   And then the other thing is high processing analytics and data storage.
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:27.640]   Right.
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:31.000]   So with Palantir and Snowflake, what you're seeing is
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.520]   you know, having to pay for getting the data someplace
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:40.200]   and then the cost of analytics on it, which are more expensive.
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.680]   The other thing that's interesting in this is
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.360]   number of multi-cloud companies.
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:46.920]   Not all of them by any means.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:52.520]   And I would have thought AWS would be totally dominant,
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.680]   but Google Cloud has a number of big
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:57.080]   clients here.
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:03.400]   Snapchat, TikTok, Unity, Data Dog.
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:06.120]   Palantir doesn't have a parenthesis text to it.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.240]   It's unknown.
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.600]   And we don't know.
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:09.000]   Okay.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.080]   We don't know where Palantir lives.
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.640]   But Vladimir knows.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:15.560]   Who knows?
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:16.360]   No one knows.
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:18.600]   But they're spending like crazy.
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.720]   Palantir was an AWS.
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.120]   Well, this doesn't say that.
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:24.920]   Interestingly.
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:31.240]   Amazon, Amazon, there was a big kerfuffle two years ago,
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:32.360]   where their employers were like,
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:34.120]   we can no longer host Palantir.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:34.760]   Oh, interesting.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.520]   I don't think Amazon gave it.
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.400]   No, they don't share about this.
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:40.200]   Thanks though.
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:47.240]   Microsoft has once again been affirmed as the victor and the Jedi contract,
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.120]   by the way.
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:50.120]   And Jeff Bezos is hopping mad.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:53.320]   He says, this is a corrupt process.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.920]   He's right.
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:55.800]   He's right.
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:58.440]   Well, I don't, is it?
[01:59:58.440 --> 01:59:59.320]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.200]   You can't tell.
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:00.760]   That's the problem.
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:02.280]   There's no faith left.
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:03.480]   I'm not the expert in this.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.800]   That's what corruption does.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:08.520]   It just utterly destroys your faith in any system.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:10.600]   But does, but Amazon's contention is, well,
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:13.880]   we're clearly, obviously, technically superior.
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:15.400]   The Pentagon should have chosen us.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:15.960]   Is that true?
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:18.360]   No, no.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:20.200]   Amazon, well, okay.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:23.960]   Microsoft, Amazon would like you to think that in like,
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:26.360]   Gartner's magic quadrant puts it up there.
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.600]   But Microsoft's cloud is not shabby.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:32.040]   It is a very, like, if they chose Google, I'd be like,
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:34.200]   okay, that was, that was a weird deal.
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:36.280]   But choosing Microsoft is not.
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.160]   Right.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:42.760]   Yeah, that's, so I'm not sure I buy that part, but this is the thing.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:43.960]   It's an unknown process.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:49.320]   The Pentagon admitted they screwed up, calculating the cost.
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.640]   And they said, but we're still going to give it to Microsoft.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:56.680]   Amazon came back with a lower price, but they said,
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.760]   but we're still going to give it to Microsoft.
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.960]   So maybe that kind of confirms it.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:03.720]   This is the statement for Amazon.
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:09.000]   Why we will continue to protest this politically corrupted contract award.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.080]   When the DOD announced its plans for corrective action in March,
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:17.000]   we objected because it was clear it was nothing more than a do-over for
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.360]   Microsoft to fix its non-compliant proposal.
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:27.720]   The DOD's reevaluation was nothing more than an attempt to validate a flawed,
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:30.040]   biased, and politically corrupted decision.
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:35.640]   It's important to point out the DOD cited prices, a major factor in the previous decision.
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:39.640]   This time we offered AWS, offer this Amazon speaking, offered a lower cost
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:41.640]   by several tens of millions of dollars.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:45.560]   The DOD's decision to intentionally ignore the clear cost benefits
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.560]   offered by AWS reinforces the fact that this corrective action
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:51.800]   was never meant to be fair.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.560]   That's Trump's favorite word.
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:56.680]   Fair.
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:58.680]   Fair.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:01:59.400]   Fair.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:01:59.880]   Sad.
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:05.800]   Anyway, I guess there's still a court battle, but from the point of view of the
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.560]   Department of Defense, it's done and over and that's it.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:15.960]   But yeah, Jeff's really saying this is a corrupt process.
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:17.880]   He's not pulling punches anymore.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:23.560]   Unlike a lot of big CEOs who are still kind of careful.
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.800]   Yeah, at this point, I don't think it doesn't matter.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.600]   I feel like Trump could set a small animal on fire on national television
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.400]   and people who like him will still like him and the rest of us will be like,
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:36.600]   "Oh my God, did you see that?"
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.240]   That's very clear.
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:38.200]   Yeah, it was cheerful.
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:41.320]   He said it at the beginning of the campaign.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:44.600]   He said, "I could shoot somebody in Fifth Avenue and it wouldn't lose any votes."
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:46.280]   Now he's killed.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.480]   Who knows how many people with COVID-19?
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:50.840]   So here's a question for you.
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:51.880]   Didn't matter.
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:56.040]   Are you pissed that Bob Woodward held his, what he knows for the book?
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:57.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:03.800]   So that's another insight that some have drawn is that plenty of people knew
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.400]   what was going on in the White House, but waited till it was close to the election
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.800]   so they could make big bucks with a book contract.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.080]   And that's pretty obvious, right?
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:13.880]   The books are coming back.
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:16.600]   And Woodward has a lot of hate, but he's had it for six months.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:17.560]   Yep, sad on that.
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:19.560]   And could have made a difference early on.
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.960]   Although, so here's what the president said to Woodward.
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:28.040]   By the way, did you find it interesting how instead of Woodward asking a question and sitting back,
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:32.680]   he was really interacting, talking back, you talking over the president and stuff.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.120]   What did you think, Jeff, of that conversation?
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:37.240]   That seemed a little odd to me.
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:39.000]   That wasn't like a reporter saying any question.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.360]   I think that's how you deal with Trump.
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.200]   I think that's how you deal with Trump is you push him.
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:46.040]   And that's how you get him to say things like, I don't care about black people.
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:48.680]   Why would I care about black people is basically what Trump said.
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:50.200]   I don't have any empathy.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:53.080]   Maybe that's because Jonathan is saying, are you really saying this?
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:57.640]   Yeah, maybe that's the case because Jonathan Swan did exactly the same thing in his access
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:59.160]   interview with the president.
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:00.920]   He kind of prodded him.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.880]   And I guess the idea is if you continue to prod, eventually he's going to throw up his hands and
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.720]   say, well, let me tell you the, so what the president said to Woodward is,
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:15.560]   oh, I knew in February it was going to be bad, but I didn't want to panic the nation.
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.320]   And that's something a lot of presidents would say.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:22.920]   I'm sure when they discovered aliens in area 51, that's what Herbert Hoover said,
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:28.840]   is I don't want the world, I don't want to tell the nation that the aliens are among us.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.040]   Whoever it was, I don't know.
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.800]   It was probably Eisenhower.
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:37.160]   Eisenhower, you know, I didn't want to get people upset riled up.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:39.480]   So he said, I'm not going to tell them about the aliens.
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:41.160]   Let's just keep this between us.
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:48.680]   I think it's probably the case that you could tell people, look, this virus is going to be bad,
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:51.000]   and we need to really prepare for it.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.560]   Wouldn't panic people the same way aliens might?
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.560]   But is that a reasonable?
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.320]   I mean, that certainly presidents have said that before presidents don't tell us the truth all the
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:04:59.720]   time, right?
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:01.480]   They'd be to prevent panic.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:07.640]   So Margaret Sullivan, the Washington Post, is writing about it and talk to Woodward.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:08.680]   What did he just call?
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:09.240]   What do you tell him?
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.440]   I'm trying to fight it now.
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:13.320]   Yeah, because it is a shame that he didn't release this earlier.
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:17.320]   But it's also, I guess, if you wanted to make an impact and you want to make a lot of money on
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:22.680]   a book, holding it to a close to the election isn't a fully cynical.
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:23.240]   Is it cynical?
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.520]   Maybe that's a little cynical.
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:25.640]   It's this is cynical.
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:29.080]   Here's the calculus.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:33.640]   Would it have changed anything if he released the questions?
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.520]   Yeah, I think at least media couldn't have had the narrative that, well, do you say this?
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.480]   But Trump says that.
[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:43.160]   The denialism would have been at least poked through.
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:47.320]   He would have found something else to say, but it does seem bad.
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:52.360]   If you're a journalist and Woodward is a journalist, does he still work for the post or is he just on his own?
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:54.280]   Yeah, kind of.
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.800]   So he's a journalist.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:58.280]   So if you're a journalist and you have a big scoop,
[02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:04.920]   I can understand why Mary Trump might have done that.
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:07.080]   I can even understand why Michael Cohen might have done that.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:09.000]   But what was the journalist?
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:09.320]   Right.
[02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:17.480]   He told Trump, I told him it was for the book, but did not sign the agreement, promising any timing.
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:18.760]   He says, I don't do that.
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:22.680]   Woodward said the aim was to provide a fuller context that could occur in a news story,
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:24.840]   which is a real slap at the Washington Post.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:27.960]   I knew I could tell the second draft of history.
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:28.920]   Oh, gag me.
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:33.080]   And I hate that phrase that we write the first draft.
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:34.520]   That means we ignore history.
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:37.080]   That means only things that are new are news to us.
[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:39.080]   And we don't care about history in this ridiculous.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:42.200]   Anyway, I knew I could tell it before the election.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:48.760]   That's interesting.
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:49.800]   It's really interesting.
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.680]   What do you think, Stacey?
[02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:55.640]   Are journalists compelled to write the story the minute they learn something?
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:57.400]   Tell the world, will they know it?
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.880]   Oh, you're muted.
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:03.960]   She doesn't want to tell the world, you say, because...
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.200]   No, my dog started crawling.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:07.640]   I would say...
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:09.880]   He doesn't like Bob Woodward either, I think.
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:10.840]   There we go.
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:13.880]   I would say normally we are.
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:21.800]   I do think there are cases where you might not share information because for a short time,
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.760]   for national security or for weird...
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:25.240]   Right.
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:26.280]   Patriotic reasons.
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:26.680]   I do.
[02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.720]   I'm old fashioned that way.
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:30.920]   No, I think that's reasonable.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:33.720]   For the most part,
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:37.400]   like I would not have sat on those tapes.
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:39.560]   Maybe his publisher told him to...
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:41.240]   I don't really understand.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:43.960]   It's possible, like the first couple of weeks,
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.440]   he didn't know how bad it was going to be.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:47.640]   So, like, I don't...
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:48.280]   Yeah, this was...
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:48.920]   Yes, that's part of it.
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:51.000]   This conversation was when in April?
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.880]   No, well, the original one was like in...
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:56.520]   No, Trump was referring to February.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:08:00.200]   But I think the conversation was later.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.560]   He said, Trump said I knew in February it was going to be bad.
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:06.040]   But I think...
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:06.520]   I mean, I...
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:10.360]   And part of it might just be a cynical reaction to like...
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:10.920]   No, February.
[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:12.280]   It was February, okay.
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.000]   Oh, okay.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.440]   Sorry, Stacy.
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.120]   Information went...
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:16.760]   Point of order.
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:17.800]   Point of information.
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:20.440]   There were these two problems with what he heard from Trump in February.
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:22.680]   They kept it from putting in the newspaper at the time.
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:25.960]   First, he didn't know what the source was of Trump's information.
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:27.400]   It wasn't until months later in May,
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:29.640]   which is still a long time ago from now,
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:32.920]   that Woodward learned it came from a high-level intelligence briefing in January
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:35.400]   that was also described when his days were pouring in the book.
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:38.360]   In February, what Trump told Woodward seemed hard to make sense of.
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.040]   The author told me, says...
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:44.040]   Margaret Sullivan, back then Woodward said there was no panic over the virus.
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:46.760]   Even towards the final days of the month.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.240]   I agree.
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.440]   Anthony Stucauci was publicly assuring Americans.
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.200]   There was no need to change their habits.
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:55.320]   Secondly, Woodward said, "The biggest problem I had,"
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.040]   which is always a problem with Trump,
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:08:59.880]   is I don't know if it is true.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:01.640]   That, I believe...
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:04.920]   So funny, what a more reporting, but still, it was a...
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:06.760]   February.
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:08.120]   In May, I feel like...
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:11.160]   So in February, having...
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.440]   I've only dealt with an unreliable source in very few instances,
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.120]   and it's horrible.
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.040]   And so, Trump would be a nightmare to interview and try to work with
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:25.000]   from that perspective.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:30.680]   So more reporting, okay, I'm not understanding where Trump got that from.
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:34.120]   But as soon as he got that, I do kind of feel like...
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:35.880]   I would have released it.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:39.080]   Woodward said he believes his highest purpose isn't to write the daily stories.
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:41.560]   That's a really snotty thing for a journal scientist.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:41.880]   Yeah, that is.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:45.480]   But to give his readers the big picture, one that may have a greater effect,
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:47.400]   especially with a consequential election looming.
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:50.360]   Oh, that's just his ego talking.
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:51.160]   Exactly.
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.760]   And he had an influence and then went, "Oh!"
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:55.320]   So there were a couple of conversations.
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:59.480]   February 7th, Trump said, "The coronavirus is more deadly.
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:02.520]   You know you're even than your strenuous flu."
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:07.960]   On February 26th, he told the public it's going to go away.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.000]   So at that point in February, he maybe...
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.640]   Maybe he knew maybe he didn't know maybe he was trying to impress Woodward.
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:14.440]   "Oh, it's bad."
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:16.200]   Because that's part of it.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:18.200]   Like you said, he's an unreliable...
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:20.680]   He says things for a variety of reasons.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.640]   Sometimes just to...
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:26.440]   As any human does this sound more authoritative,
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:28.760]   it was in March that he told...
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:34.200]   It's when in March 19th that he told Woodward on tape,
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:35.960]   "I always wanted to play it down.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:38.680]   I still like playing it down because I don't want to create a panic."
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:41.240]   So in February, he says really serious.
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:45.000]   In March, he says, a month later he says, "But I'm playing it down."
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:48.280]   So I don't know.
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:51.400]   I mean, these are ongoing conversations it sounds like.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.240]   I'm also amazed.
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:59.400]   I am so amazed that the president will talk to people who are clearly trying to write negative
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:10:59.800]   story.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:00.440]   Here you go.
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:01.080]   You go like that.
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:02.520]   He goes into ego in history.
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:04.920]   He can't help himself.
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:05.560]   Good Lord.
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:08.920]   You know, all of this is going to be a very...
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:09.560]   I hope...
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.720]   You know, the old phrase, "History will judge them."
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:24.440]   I hope that I live long enough to just hear a clear, concise, accurate story of what the hell happened in 2020.
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:25.720]   Because I don't think...
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:27.240]   I think there's as much we don't know.
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:29.480]   But I do think...
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:30.520]   I kind of agree with you.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.080]   It is somebody like Woodward's responsibility,
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:35.800]   if he knows something that early to say.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:39.320]   But it could also be respect to the office.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:40.600]   If, you know...
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:41.880]   What?
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:42.520]   Well, yeah.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:51.000]   If LBJ had told you, listen, Jeff, there are aliens in area 51.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.360]   But I don't want to create public scare.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:57.880]   You might not send that tape to Twitter.
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:11:59.800]   Though you have a higher...
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:03.400]   As a journalist, you have a higher responsibility to the public.
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:09.560]   I think at the point when the aliens had clearly come down and started murdering small
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:10.040]   children.
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:10.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:11.880]   That's when you would say...
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.960]   That's when you would say, "Yeah, this could be worse."
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:15.560]   You might sit with that for a minute.
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:17.800]   Like, "Okay, let's see how this plays out."
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:21.720]   But once, you know, 100,000 people were dead, I think you'd be like, "Alright."
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:23.640]   Well, April 19th, it was still early, right?
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:24.520]   We only...
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:25.720]   No, it wasn't that early.
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:27.160]   That was a month of the lockdown.
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:27.800]   No, you're right.
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:31.000]   But still, we might have stayed in the lockdown.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.640]   I mean, lives would have, could have been saved.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:36.920]   And trying to prove the negative gets you nowhere.
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:40.200]   He withheld information from the American people.
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.000]   He's a journalist.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.520]   He should be ashamed of himself.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:44.120]   Full, effing, stop.
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:44.600]   They're a John.
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:45.240]   I didn't say it.
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:51.400]   So are you going to stop teaching Woodward's stuff in your journalism classes?
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.800]   Do you put an asterisk?
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:57.880]   No, I fancy today whether there should be a movement to withdraw his Pulitzer prize
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:12:59.400]   for killing people.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:01.720]   I don't think.
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:04.280]   Hey, let's do a change log and end the show.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.240]   I'm going to do a change log.
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:05.720]   I'm just going to...
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:07.400]   I'm going to have one more piece of information.
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:12.600]   On April 19th, there had already been 13,899 deaths.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.320]   Yeah.
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:17.960]   So there were enough deaths to say, yeah, this could get bad.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.760]   Good fact, boy.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:19.240]   Yeah, very.
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:21.000]   This is serious.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:21.560]   Yeah.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:21.880]   Okay.
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:24.360]   Time for the Google.
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:25.080]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.520]   I got to do this thing.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.960]   Oh, this thing.
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:28.440]   The thing.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:29.240]   Coming up next.
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.200]   The thing.
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:31.400]   The Google change log.
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:31.960]   It's coming up.
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:33.880]   And now it's time for the...
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:35.560]   How long do we have to wait for it, Leo?
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:35.880]   Well, I'll ask.
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:38.760]   Mr. Jarvis.
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:42.840]   And now the name or may not be an ad here.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:43.320]   I don't know.
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:47.720]   And now it's time.
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:51.400]   Let's play the drums or trumpets or whatever those are called.
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:52.600]   Oh, Google change logs.
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:53.240]   Sorry, Leo.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:55.160]   Why are you apologizing?
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:56.600]   I enjoyed that.
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.880]   Hey, this is cool.
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:01.480]   That's cool.
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:02.040]   This is cool.
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:02.920]   Oh, we're back.
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:03.880]   That's auto play.
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:04.360]   Auto play.
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:05.560]   You don't know what's going to happen next.
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:09.400]   Google's got this new verified calls feature.
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.520]   It's coming to Android phones.
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:15.160]   Verified calls will display the caller's name, their logo.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:17.640]   But a company, when it's making business calls,
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:21.640]   can now add why they're calling.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:24.600]   And let us scam you.
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:25.240]   And yeah.
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:27.800]   I would like to sell you something.
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:30.520]   How's your sighting?
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:35.160]   And there will be a verification symbol that will indicate the call has been verified
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:37.080]   by Google.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.680]   So if you're a legitimate business,
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:39.160]   they're applied.
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:39.480]   How?
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:45.320]   With Google's amazing information.
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:47.400]   But think about this.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:48.360]   I get business calls.
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:49.320]   It's hard access.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:49.880]   All the time.
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:53.560]   Maybe it's from somebody, you know, maybe your car is done.
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:54.840]   Kind of a call.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:55.240]   It's car.
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:55.240]   It's car.
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:56.760]   It's updated for the mobile era.
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:00.120]   I just know that it's a good call.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:02.200]   A call is garnets.
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.120]   Oh, oh, God.
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:05.320]   Another red hole.
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:06.120]   Oh, no.
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:07.400]   Oh, sorry.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:08.120]   I didn't ask.
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:09.240]   I don't care.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:09.960]   I'll Google it.
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.200]   Go.
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:10.680]   Oh, you do.
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:11.400]   I was going to show you.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.760]   Now I used to show you who car I kiss.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:13.640]   Here, we'll do this.
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:14.200]   You, Jeff and I.
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.400]   You never stop for you.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:16.200]   Jeff and I'll do this.
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:18.840]   Imagine I'm wearing a giant purple satin turban.
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:22.840]   And you've got an envelope in your hand.
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:24.600]   No, I have an envelope and I'm putting it to my head.
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:26.200]   And I am saying,
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:29.640]   Sis boom ba.
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:32.680]   Sis boom ba.
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:34.280]   And then I give this to you, Jeff.
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.440]   You open the envelope and you say,
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:39.640]   I don't have the punch line for you.
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:40.440]   So you're going to have to do one.
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:43.320]   What is the sound made by an exploding sheep?
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:48.600]   That's Karnak the Magnificent.
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:51.400]   In a nutshell, it's Johnny Carson.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.000]   It's an American icon.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.120]   It's a Johnny Carson bit.
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:54.520]   Yeah.
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:57.000]   Wait, did you know who Karnak was?
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.280]   Yes, I did.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:15:59.400]   You did.
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.160]   Oh, Uncle Ant.
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:01.640]   Thank you.
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:03.240]   How did you know, Ant?
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.880]   Is this something you saw with Rick?
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:07.640]   It's used to watch a Johnny Carson show.
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:08.920]   Oh, it's grand parents.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:09.560]   Okay.
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:09.880]   Okay.
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:12.200]   Watch and learn children.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:13.240]   Just a little bit of a match.
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:14.200]   Watch and learn.
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:22.200]   The guy was going to break up.
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:29.160]   Because he knows the joke, but he's laughing.
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:30.360]   I trouble divining this one.
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:33.080]   So the idea is he's a mind.
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:33.960]   Sis boom ba.
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.400]   He's a mind reader, right?
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:37.880]   He's looking, he's reading an envelope and he's saying,
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:39.160]   Sis boom ba.
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:40.440]   It's the answer to a question.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:41.320]   He opens the envelope.
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:41.880]   Boom ba.
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.520]   He always glows in the envelope.
[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:45.160]   He always did that.
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.320]   That's grand sound made when a sheep explodes.
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:53.560]   Now in order to laugh at that,
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:59.560]   you also have to know that Sis boom ba was the,
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.000]   the cheer.
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:03.960]   Who was it?
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.000]   Whose cheer was that?
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:08.440]   I'm trying to remember it.
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:10.040]   Now, Karnak, if I look it up,
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:12.680]   I don't remember the cheer.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:13.720]   And now it goes to Karnak.
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:15.480]   Um, it's a cheerleading chant.
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:19.320]   Originally from 1867.
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:21.640]   That's how old we are.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:22.040]   Stacey.
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:22.680]   Yup.
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:26.840]   And actually it imitates the sound of a skyrocket flight.
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.880]   The burst of the fireworks.
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:30.200]   Boom.
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:32.040]   And the reaction, the crowd.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:34.680]   Hey Stacey, Stacey, you had to ask, didn't you?
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:35.480]   You see what she started?
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.680]   You had to ask.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:37.880]   You could've just let it go.
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:38.840]   Karnak reference.
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:39.640]   You're right. I'm sorry.
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:40.760]   I was just confused.
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:43.400]   Cheerleaders at the University of Texas,
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:44.360]   after they were saying,
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:47.720]   I've been working on the railroad with Chances boom ba.
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:51.160]   Oh my gosh.
[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:52.040]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:53.480]   One more, play one more Karnak joke.
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:55.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no more Karnak.
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:55.880]   No more Karnak.
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:56.840]   Keep going, keep going.
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:58.440]   Moving on.
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:17:59.000]   Change log.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.360]   Yeah, try to live.
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:01.080]   Let's talk about it.
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:06.120]   Okay, you can choose to leave this in or edit it out.
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:09.480]   It's up to you.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:11.240]   This is from 1974.
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:15.320]   I think this is going to get us taken down by the Johnny Carson.
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.720]   Yeah, probably will be.
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:18.040]   Yeah.
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:21.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very exciting night for us.
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:24.760]   Not only are all the members of our fantasy family with us,
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:26.120]   we also have a great visit.
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:27.000]   We'll be right wide.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.880]   The famous seer, sage, all knowing, all seeing, all omniscient.
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:35.160]   And former master of ceremonies at a house of pies.
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:39.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, Karnak, the magnific.
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:41.160]   So this is my past for comedy in the '70s.
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:44.120]   Now I should also tell you, he would do this as a regular bit,
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:48.200]   and he will watch as he enters stumble over the step,
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:50.520]   because he did every time.
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:51.400]   Go ahead, John.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:53.480]   Let's roll that tape.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:03.400]   It's Johnny in a cape and a giant.
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:04.360]   And that was wrong.
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:05.560]   It's red, turban.
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:05.880]   Watch.
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:09.240]   Every time he stumbles on that step, every time.
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.840]   I guess this is from an era when Rip.
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:15.800]   Well, we didn't know what funny was.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:23.640]   There was an article a while back about how sitcom writing,
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:26.200]   if you go back and look at it, it's horrible.
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:27.880]   Come here and see today.
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:28.680]   Yeah.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:35.640]   Well, even today, if you watch my favorite geek show,
[02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:37.800]   The Big Bang Theory.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:39.240]   Yeah, I like Big Bang Theory.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:43.160]   And if you take the laugh track out, it's not funny.
[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:46.440]   It's like that's not a joke, but people are laughing.
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:48.760]   It's not funny.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:50.040]   So let's do one here.
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:50.600]   Let's do one.
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:51.320]   Silence, please.
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:52.440]   As thy divinely.
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:53.800]   Yes, hermetically sealed.
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:54.760]   Yes, I understand that.
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:55.960]   Funkin Wagner's porch.
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:57.320]   He's sealed up the portion of the day.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:57.880]   Yes.
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:59.320]   He means that no one could even open it up if they want.
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:00.520]   That may be his name.
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:01.160]   Except you.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:04.120]   That's true.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:10.840]   He's going to say something about a camel nesting in your bippy or something.
[02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:11.800]   That happens too.
[02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:12.280]   Yeah.
[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:13.560]   A thousand clowns.
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:14.680]   A thousand clowns.
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:16.120]   A thousand clowns.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.720]   That's what I said.
[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:22.600]   It's very formulaic, but that's part of what's funny about it.
[02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:24.520]   Who put together the NBC4 schedule?
[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:30.600]   That's funny because the affiliates we should mention are in the audience for that one.
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:33.560]   Because he mentioned our NBC family is in the audience.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.240]   So good state.
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:39.400]   Well, in its time.
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:42.040]   I just pointed out your grandparents loved it.
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:46.040]   He was hugely influential on my style of comedy.
[02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:46.760]   Oh, exactly.
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:47.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:48.440]   Yeah.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:50.840]   Okay.
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:53.240]   What David Letterman was to the next generation.
[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:54.760]   Yeah.
[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:56.120]   So cheers.
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:57.880]   You were on sitcoms a minute ago.
[02:20:57.880 --> 02:20:58.600]   Stacey's dying.
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:20:59.000]   I love it.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.440]   Cheers.
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:02.680]   There was a really interesting analysis.
[02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:06.440]   I just put up of its rear episode.
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:09.400]   Stacey's going to ram the mic into her eye.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:15.080]   I also have my TV guide column there being a former TV guide TV critic.
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:15.400]   Yes.
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:19.080]   Which I said that cheers was perhaps the perfect show the best ever.
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:20.840]   That's all there on the line.
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:21.320]   Wow.
[02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:22.040]   I disagree.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:22.920]   You're wrong.
[02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:24.200]   There have been better shows since.
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:25.000]   So it's not you.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.040]   Oh, well since perhaps.
[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:26.520]   No, no, no.
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:29.640]   Here ladies and gentlemen, I give you just to prove your theory.
[02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:31.080]   This is a modern sitcom.
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:33.800]   The Big Bang Theory Without a Laugh Track.
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:39.400]   Nothing makes beer taste better than cool, clear Rocky Mountains spring water.
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.680]   I don't have the Rocky Mountains anyway.
[02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:45.160]   Philadelphia.
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:47.480]   Really?
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:49.240]   I thought they were out west someplace.
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:50.120]   Think about it, Raj.
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:52.280]   Where did the movie Rocky take place?
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:55.000]   For the Philadelphia.
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.080]   Okay, now I get it.
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:00.680]   Let me know if you hear a joke in there.
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:04.920]   So it's funny though, because there were a lot of laughs which we didn't hear.
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:08.280]   It's like going to a Roddy Dangerfield show, which I did a couple times.
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:08.600]   Yeah.
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:11.320]   And the stuff was never funny, but you laughed your ass.
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:12.440]   I like Rodney James.
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:14.520]   It was part of being in the atmosphere.
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:15.560]   I don't get it.
[02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:16.120]   Back to me.
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:17.160]   Oh, all right.
[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:18.680]   Google's area 120.
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:21.480]   Still does Stacey do you know who wanted to move this?
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:24.040]   I think you have to conversely.
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:25.560]   What was his main line Stacey?
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.840]   What was his, but let's prove this now.
[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:27.640]   Let's see if you really know.
[02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:32.200]   What was I like to say, this is Alice to the Moon because it's so old.
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:37.160]   That's Jackie Gleason on the honeymooners.
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.000]   Jesus.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.840]   Apparently I don't get no respect.
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.040]   I don't get no respect.
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:45.800]   Let me get my other foot out of my grave.
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:52.200]   I don't want this week in Google to turn into two old guys
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:55.000]   making fun of the young person.
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.160]   It already has Leo.
[02:22:57.160 --> 02:22:58.840]   He has to use younger than I am.
[02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:00.360]   The younger person is making fun of us.
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:05.400]   I'm not making, I simply asked who Carvak was.
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:10.120]   Stattler and Waldorf explain comedy to a young person.
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:12.760]   Is that where Waldorf?
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:13.640]   Can we, okay.
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:14.040]   Back to it.
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:15.880]   Like, you know who's that one?
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:16.680]   You know who's that one on Waldorf?
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:17.480]   All right.
[02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:19.400]   Those are the cranky men in the Muppets.
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:24.120]   Please tell me those are the cranky men in the Muppets.
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:28.360]   Google's Area 1, yes they are.
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:31.640]   Google's Area 120 launches Orion Wi-Fi,
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.760]   a service that allows carriers in need of better service
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:39.400]   to rent public venue Wi-Fi networks.
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:42.040]   I don't even understand.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:44.440]   This is like, because the hotel is ripping you off.
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:45.080]   I don't understand.
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:52.840]   So Area 120 is the blue sky research arm of Google,
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:54.840]   right? Area 120 experimental stuff.
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:56.600]   Later sometimes becomes a business.
[02:23:56.600 --> 02:24:00.200]   They've created this thing Orion Wi-Fi.
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:01.240]   Let me, here's their description.
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:06.440]   As you walk into the grocery store, Orion helps the local network
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:09.320]   tell the carrier about its pricing quality.
[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:11.880]   If the carrier decides the connection is good enough,
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.080]   we'll auto connect you.
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:15.640]   If the quality is too low, we won't.
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:19.320]   When your connected internet traffic flows over the Wi-Fi network,
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:21.960]   just as if you had connected directly to the Wi-Fi,
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.160]   Orion cannot access users' internet traffic.
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:27.000]   I don't understand what this does.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:28.200]   Well, is the grocery store a system?
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:31.720]   Is this kind of like phone or whatever Comcast and stuff do,
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:33.960]   where they take available public Wi-Fi
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:38.360]   and they, but instead of just giving it to their users,
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:39.880]   they're selling it to carriers?
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:41.960]   Is that what's happening here?
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:43.000]   I don't know. Let's keep going.
[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:46.120]   Yeah. It's actually kind of like interesting.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:47.480]   Arbitrage thing, but yeah.
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:48.760]   Gotcha.
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:49.320]   Pippi.
[02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:51.560]   We have some in the freezer.
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:52.600]   Did you eat it, John? Yeah.
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:53.480]   You didn't eat it yet?
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:54.680]   Okay. We have some in the freezer.
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:58.200]   Oh, John, how can you be so inhuman that you would delay this?
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:00.680]   He said it's just some spaghetti with cheese.
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:01.240]   I don't know.
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:03.160]   Oh, I got more at home.
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:03.800]   I'm like eight.
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:07.080]   You know, it's not good reheated.
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:07.640]   Sure.
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:09.000]   It's got to be fresh.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.440]   Hey, here's a good thing.
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:11.640]   Now you can try it yet.
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:15.640]   Stacey, you need to try it.
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.080]   It's I'm telling you, it's good.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:18.680]   Can't show you, Pippi?
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:20.120]   I eat it all the time.
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:21.880]   The trader, the trader, Joe's,
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:22.520]   can't show you Pippi.
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:23.400]   The frozen, the frozen, the car.
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:25.560]   Oh, I don't have a trader Joe's anywhere near me.
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:27.560]   Oh, for you, you need to move back to Texas.
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:28.760]   I thought they were from Seattle.
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:29.560]   Yeah.
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:31.320]   Okay.
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:32.920]   By near me, I mean on the island.
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.280]   Oh, the island.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:35.160]   It's no treasure.
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:36.040]   Excuse me.
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:37.080]   On the island.
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:39.800]   I have a counter-contrainer.
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:40.600]   This is worth a busy drama.
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.160]   Drama drama.
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:42.200]   Me, Stacey.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:44.200]   This is worth going over a bridge.
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:45.240]   It's a ferry.
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:49.000]   35 minute, 20 dollar ferry.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:49.960]   It's 20 bucks?
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:50.440]   Oh, wow.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:51.240]   Do I realize?
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:51.800]   Keep it.
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:52.920]   Is there a bridge somewhere?
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:57.240]   There's a bridge to Densla,
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:25:58.040]   which is rural,
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.240]   and then I can drive all the way around
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:00.280]   to Comer for an hour and a half.
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:01.000]   That's too far.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:01.480]   Yeah.
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:02.120]   Are you really?
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:02.600]   No.
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:03.960]   You're really living in the sticks.
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:07.400]   I'm going to have fiber in a month.
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:08.040]   Do you like it?
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:09.800]   I do most of the time.
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:11.560]   I mean, most of the time I don't mind taking the ferry,
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:12.520]   and the ferry has summer rates,
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:14.200]   which is why it's expensive now.
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:15.480]   They should have local rates.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:17.800]   Like, oh, I live here, so I should get a deal.
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:18.360]   I agree.
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:18.520]   Yeah.
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:19.000]   Yeah.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.040]   But it is public transportation,
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:23.320]   so I'm paying for it,
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:25.720]   and I am able to live on an island.
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:26.920]   Yeah, no, that's cool.
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:27.800]   I want to do that.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:31.320]   But like you, I would have to pay for
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:34.280]   life evacuation insurance,
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:35.320]   medevac insurance.
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:38.680]   That's another story for another day.
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:40.600]   Google Podcasts for Android.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:41.560]   This is good news.
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.880]   Allows you to cast.
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:45.960]   It's on the now playing screen.
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:47.480]   There's now a cast button.
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:48.440]   So if you're listening,
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:50.520]   this is a good reason to use Google Podcasts.
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:53.800]   You can now cast it to your home theater system,
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:56.600]   or anything else with Chromecast or casting available.
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:00.280]   I guess you, yeah, you could cast it to a Google
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.000]   speaker.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.080]   Your Google Home Max or something.
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:09.000]   And I like this.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.840]   Carsten is padding a little bit,
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:13.560]   because there are only four stories in the changelog.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:18.120]   And two of them are Google's area 120 launches
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:18.920]   right in one.
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:21.960]   If you didn't understand it the first time,
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:24.360]   you'll get it the second time you feel.
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:27.240]   And that's the Google changelog.
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:36.200]   Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.040]   Let us let us wrap this pleasant.
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:41.320]   This has been a five hour show.
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.600]   So, and it feels like it.
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:45.800]   This show is longer than any other show I do for some reason.
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:46.120]   Is it?
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:47.880]   It's Jeff's fault.
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:51.000]   No, well, we do get you asked about Cardack.
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.600]   We do get to your fault.
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:54.920]   But I think it's because we enjoy hanging out with each other.
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:27:56.600]   And it's just a big part of it.
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:56.920]   Yeah.
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:59.960]   I just wish the listeners felt that way too.
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:06.840]   Actually, I always start with Stacy's thing.
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:08.600]   Let's start with Ants stuff today.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:11.400]   Oh, mine's easy.
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.080]   At the time of recording this,
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:17.640]   this show, Filmic Pro announced a new feature with their,
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:21.000]   excuse me, with their iOS and Android mobile app
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.120]   that allows you to get clean HDMI out
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:28.360]   with your camera to be used as a webcam
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:30.680]   in your computer setup.
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:32.440]   Now, I must say, with the use that for the show,
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:35.400]   this is an app I've used for quite a while now.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:39.000]   But when you go to buy that app, it's a $15 app.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.320]   Yeah, but I own it because that was the one that was going to have
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.440]   use all three cameras and record all three at the same time.
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:47.880]   Did they ever add that feature?
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:50.200]   I don't recall.
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:53.240]   They put it in a free little app,
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:55.960]   but I wonder if they put it in the Filmic Pro app ever.
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.480]   It's probably in there by now.
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:58.840]   By now, it ought to be.
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:00.440]   Well, that's great news.
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:02.680]   So how do I get HDMI out?
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:04.520]   Well, there's a dongle, isn't there?
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:06.280]   Yep, you just get a dongle.
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:11.480]   And get a dongle and actually have a USB C power supply on it
[02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:14.360]   where I can plug in some power to it as well.
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:15.400]   And you'll be good to go.
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:19.640]   Like I said, I've used them for other things that I've done
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:22.440]   with my smartphone and gimbals
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:25.880]   because their app also ties into smartphone gimbals
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:29.240]   and allows you to do different controls with the video
[02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:31.240]   on the gimbals hardware.
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:34.360]   It's a really good app and seeing that they're sort of thinking
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:37.880]   forward with, heck, everybody's doing all of these zooms
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:39.560]   and skips and things like that.
[02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:43.320]   And if you try to look up a Logitech C920 on Amazon,
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:44.920]   you're not going to find one, no.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:46.360]   What is it?
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.200]   Will it be better than the Logitech?
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:49.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:50.200]   You got a good camera.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:50.600]   Yeah.
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:51.880]   Your smartphone camera is.
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:52.360]   Yeah.
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:53.000]   Oh, you think?
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:53.320]   Yeah.
[02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:54.840]   Nice.
[02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:57.400]   Put a nice light in front of it and put it on a tripod
[02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:58.680]   and get to go.
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:29:59.960]   I'm going to play with that tonight.
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:02.920]   I'm doing what you're doing.
[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:04.440]   You're going to have to help me do it when--
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:09.160]   I need to find a dongle from my Android device
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:11.480]   because nowadays, most of the smartphones,
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:14.840]   all they have one I/O port on them.
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:17.160]   So I need to get a dongle that's going to allow me
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:21.880]   to be able to connect HDMI out as well as add power
[02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:22.680]   to my smartphone.
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:23.800]   Because when you shoot in video,
[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:25.400]   you're going to shoot through to battery
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:27.800]   and Phil McNose says, hey, get a dongle.
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:29.640]   That'll let you do both.
[02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:32.760]   I have just redownloaded Phil McPro.
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:33.880]   That's fantastic.
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:34.920]   Paid four to a while ago.
[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:37.960]   My pick of the week is something you can pick up
[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:41.480]   at your local trader, Joe's.
[02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:44.200]   It's something we like to call
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:52.120]   "Caccio e Pepe," which is just Italian for spaghetti and pepper.
[02:30:52.120 --> 02:30:53.800]   It's really effing good.
[02:30:53.800 --> 02:30:55.640]   Don't get scared when you open it up.
[02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:59.400]   The "Caccio" is little squares that, of course,
[02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:02.600]   Michael wrote out, but it's spectacular.
[02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:03.720]   It's spectacular.
[02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:06.520]   According to the cover, spaghetti pasta
[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:12.040]   and a rich creamy sauce with pecorino ramana cheese and black pepper.
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:14.120]   That's mine.
[02:31:14.120 --> 02:31:14.760]   That's good.
[02:31:14.760 --> 02:31:15.480]   Pick of the week.
[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.360]   That's your pick of the week.
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:23.400]   My pick of the week is Ift Pro.
[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:25.400]   This morning gift.
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:26.040]   Mm.
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:29.080]   Launched a pro service for consumers.
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:32.440]   This means a lot of things, but what it mostly means is
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:34.440]   you now can have your triggers,
[02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:37.400]   they can set up multiple actions.
[02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:41.080]   You can also do queries with your triggers.
[02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:45.720]   If I say if my Android device comes within a certain range
[02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:51.640]   and my door, my Yale lock is locked, do the following.
[02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:55.560]   There's a lot more things that can happen.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:59.960]   The caveat here is it costs money.
[02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:02.040]   The other thing it does,
[02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:05.960]   so they want to get us to a $9.99 subscription fee,
[02:32:05.960 --> 02:32:12.280]   but they're willing to accept $1.99 until you feel like the service is worth it.
[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:15.240]   So the idea being you pay what you want,
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:19.320]   but at least $1.99, if you decide not to pay,
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:25.400]   then you only get the applets that are available to you already from the brands
[02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:27.480]   and three custom ones that you have made.
[02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:30.520]   Oh, so they're also limiting the free plan of considerably.
[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:30.840]   Yes.
[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:36.920]   But you also get faster service if you pay and you get support,
[02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:38.120]   which has never existed.
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:43.960]   It's basically trying to compete with Zapier or some of the more
[02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:47.480]   robust paid services out there.
[02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:52.920]   So I pay for Zapier, but I have used if this is for a long time.
[02:32:52.920 --> 02:32:56.760]   I like Zapier for lots of web-based things,
[02:32:56.760 --> 02:32:59.000]   but they don't have that many smart home things.
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:05.160]   Now, if they say only about 25% of their users are actually doing smart home stuff.
[02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:12.520]   But as a smart home person, most of my devices are on ift.
[02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:18.280]   And so I was actually playing with air quality sensors right now, given the thing.
[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:24.520]   So I'm like, oh, maybe if my air quality sensor sells me the air quality is disintegrating,
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:30.520]   my lights can turn red in flash or and my window sensors say my windows are open,
[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:32.120]   then do this. Ta-da!
[02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:38.040]   Multi-step zaps, which are a big part of Zapier, really are great.
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:39.640]   I use them in a lot of ways.
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:43.480]   And that was always one negative of this and that. It's only two things.
[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:44.360]   If this, then that.
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:47.160]   So I think this is a huge improvement.
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:52.760]   And I don't know if it's worth 10 bucks a month.
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:56.680]   If I say $3.99, which, you know, notice they don't put $1.99,
[02:33:56.680 --> 02:33:59.080]   you have to enter that by hand if you're going to be that cheap.
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:02.360]   But if I put $3.99, which I think would be fair,
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:05.400]   would it be that forever, I wonder, or at some point, are they going to?
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:07.400]   I don't know.
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:09.800]   I mean, they can't charge more without telling you.
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:11.880]   They will let you know when the price goes up.
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:13.160]   But, you know, I had,
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:18.680]   Lyndon's going to be on the podcast tomorrow and then I wrote a story today based on our conversation.
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:21.880]   But the idea is he really,
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:27.240]   sitically, he doesn't want to piss everyone off because that's been happening a lot.
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:30.120]   But I do think he's acknowledging that for 10 years,
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.360]   people have been using IFT for free.
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:36.840]   And this is going to piss a lot of people off, especially his hardcore users.
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:41.480]   But those hardcore users, I think, could be enticed with, you know, faster,
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:44.600]   I was going to say faster latency, but lower latency, faster service.
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:49.720]   And actual really complicated and good applets.
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:50.920]   So I'm going to try it.
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:52.360]   I think it's possible too.
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:55.240]   It might help me save.
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:58.920]   Like, I could actually do things with this that I couldn't do with Wink,
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:00.760]   or that I could do with Wink.
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:03.080]   So now I don't have to have a Wink subscription.
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:08.360]   And it's possible, like, if I took my smart cameras, like my Arlo feeds,
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:13.240]   and I put them into like a drive, maybe I wouldn't have to pay for that subscription.
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:14.680]   So it might save me money.
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:17.400]   I'd have, I'm still playing with it and looking at it to say.
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:19.240]   I pay 20 bucks a month or zap year.
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:24.680]   So even 10 bucks a month would, I shouldn't be so cheap would be a good deal.
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:26.280]   It's just that I already have zap year.
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:28.120]   We use zap year a lot.
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:29.640]   Sponsors?
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:31.080]   You used to be a sponsor, right?
[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:31.640]   I don't.
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:32.920]   Are they still a sponsor?
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:33.960]   I think former.
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:36.680]   I would say if they were a current sponsor, but I don't think they are.
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:39.560]   So, but you know, they could come back.
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:42.760]   So I should say sponsor-ish.
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:46.600]   In the past, they have been a sponsor.
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:48.120]   And I do use them a lot.
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:52.280]   That's how we get all of those stories about the Orion Wi-Fi in the
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:54.040]   change box.
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:57.560]   In exchange.
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:36:04.040]   So it isn't zap years got a free tier, which gives you five zaps, which isn't too bad,
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:07.160]   but it gets pretty expensive pretty rapidly.
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:11.640]   So I wonder, I'm guessing, are there other things besides zap year?
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:13.000]   If this then that's been around forever.
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:17.720]   But I think I would guess that zap year was starting to beat him.
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:21.720]   It's the closest competitor I can think of.
[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:25.080]   So I've just subscribed to if this then that pro.
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:27.400]   And so I'll play with this a little bit.
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.640]   Yeah, because I've always had in my heart, I've always thought, you know,
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:32.840]   I want them to succeed.
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:38.680]   So and I look forward to seeing Linda Tibbetts on your show or listening on your show tomorrow.
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:39.240]   That's great.
[02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:43.000]   There is no video component to my show because we record it like 6.30 in the morning.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.560]   Yeah, you wouldn't want to see Stacey at 6.30 in the morning.
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:47.240]   I look mostly like this.
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:48.840]   I'm teasing you.
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:49.640]   Of course you do.
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:51.320]   Just a little less eye makeup.
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:52.760]   It's not the makeup.
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:55.320]   It's the I need my coffee.
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:57.880]   You don't want to see me at 6 in the morning.
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:00.360]   Why do you record so early?
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:02.840]   I have to get it to my producer.
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:03.960]   Wow.
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:05.560]   I know.
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:07.080]   And we do news and so.
[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:12.360]   What about producers that they that they are so important to the production of a show?
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:13.560]   Like they really are.
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:17.080]   We people often think the hosts are the most important part of a show,
[02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:18.040]   but it's actually not true.
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:18.760]   It's the producer.
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:20.360]   Rydney, you agree, Carsten?
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:21.560]   Get to done.
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:27.400]   I mean, I could produce my show, but I don't want to do that.
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:29.080]   No, that's the hard work.
[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:30.200]   It really is the hard work.
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:33.480]   Jeff, your number of the week, my friend.
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:35.000]   Well, I'm changing it right now.
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.360]   Oh, it's a new number.
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:46.440]   So 49 years ago, a very big deal, Harry Belafonte sat in and hosted the Tonight Show.
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:47.400]   That was a big deal.
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:51.400]   And so now there is an honor of this NPR.
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:59.240]   There's a documentary called The Sit In, Harry Belafonte hosts the Tonight Show.
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:00.600]   Nice.
[02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:03.960]   And right now on MSNBC on the readout, they're talking about that.
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:04.680]   That's how I know about it.
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:05.800]   Wow, that's a big deal.
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:06.520]   Yeah.
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:07.400]   What year was this?
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:13.640]   Well, what's today versus minus 49, 1968.
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:16.280]   So the Civil Rights Act have been passed for four years.
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:19.000]   You would think-- Wait, math doesn't work out.
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.440]   Yes, it does.
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:20.760]   Sorry.
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:21.000]   Yeah.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:29.880]   You would think that by then having a Black man host that's a night show would be no big deal.
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:31.400]   But it was.
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:33.240]   You see, you know, who--
[02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:33.720]   That was right.
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:34.360]   It was.
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:37.720]   Yes, I do because I like music.
[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:37.960]   Good.
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:39.800]   What's his famous song?
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:40.760]   Deil!
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:41.320]   Deil!
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:42.280]   Deil!
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:42.760]   Deil!
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:43.240]   Deil!
[02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:44.200]   Deil, I taught him.
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:45.400]   I love the music.
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:45.880]   I love the music.
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:46.680]   Go home.
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:47.720]   I feel young again.
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:49.720]   Deil, he said Deil!
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:50.200]   He said Deil!
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:50.840]   He said Deil!
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:54.200]   Our Mask of the Week.
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:39:01.320]   From this is our newest intern, Carsten Sunzak Modeling, the--
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:08.360]   We have pictures of Zach and Alex wearing it in the red doom of the Bay Area.
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:11.560]   It looks like it has two old TV clickers on either of us.
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:11.880]   That's the--
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.080]   Those are the big respirators.
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:15.160]   These are the 3M tech.
[02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:20.360]   T-E-K-K protection full face respirator.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:23.800]   Now Carsten, tell me it doesn't have an outbound valve
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:28.280]   that it protects both the wearer and people around them.
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:31.080]   Otherwise, I can't recommend it.
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:33.960]   Well, no one's going to get within six feet of you if you're wearing that thing.
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:34.760]   I would love to.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.600]   I actually would love to have this.
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:37.240]   How much is it?
[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:40.040]   Did you buy them for the whole family?
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:49.960]   He also recommends the stylish yet comfortable face cover.
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:53.240]   $15.97 from Verde.
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:55.160]   It's just based-- I don't think this is going to work.
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:56.680]   It's just a basic plastic.
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:00.120]   More than a face shield, the aerodynamics,
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:04.360]   allow it to be used even as a wind deflector for cycling.
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:06.360]   So let me ask you a little question.
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:07.640]   Wear a mask, folks.
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:08.280]   Don't wear that.
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:09.720]   Go ahead.
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:09.960]   Yeah.
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.040]   I feel like we could actually do a service for people.
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:17.240]   So I bought the number one Wall Street Journal mask pick
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:18.840]   from their article a little bit ago.
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:19.560]   Yes.
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:23.000]   And I just-- would y'all like to hear how it performs or not?
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:23.160]   Yes.
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:23.960]   Well, you said thank you.
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.280]   So I feel like these masks are cool, but maybe not as helpful.
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:31.000]   And I am looking more for like everyday mask wear.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.200]   Sorry, Carsten.
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:35.000]   This is the number one Wall Street Journal pick.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.040]   I'll tell you who makes it in like a wear--
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:40.840]   or wear your W-A-Y-R-E.
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:43.160]   And it's a five layer mask.
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:46.920]   And they say it features a thoughtful face enveloping design
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:48.200]   in a silky touch fabric.
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:49.080]   It's $18.
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:49.800]   Not bad.
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:50.920]   Unless you buy a material.
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:51.480]   It looks good.
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:53.720]   So this is the mask.
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:56.200]   It actually does pin to your face,
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:40:57.960]   and it's super lightweight and comfortable.
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:00.280]   It's kind of breathable.
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:03.720]   The downside is the material is not awesome
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.400]   when it comes to washing.
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:06.600]   You have to hand wash it.
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:07.080]   Oh.
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:08.920]   You cannot put it in the washer.
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:11.960]   And I'm sad because it has the stretchy these things
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:13.480]   and you get to custom fit it.
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:19.000]   So it's very comfortable, but it's not maybe practical.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.680]   So I was just going to let you all know that.
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:24.920]   So one of the other ways you can sterilize a mask
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:25.880]   is by ironing it.
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:30.040]   Oh, this has us putting spraying isopropyl alcohol on it
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:32.120]   for like 15 and letting it spray out.
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:33.720]   So you don't have to wash it each time.
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:36.120]   You could just spray alcohol on it.
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:38.920]   But then you got to let it set for a long time.
[02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:39.800]   I'll call that.
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:42.760]   Otherwise you're like, oh.
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:46.360]   You know, I have to stand by the masks that I make,
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:50.600]   which I feel the more I learn about them,
[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:52.120]   I feel like they're really good,
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:55.720]   which is use 600 thread count cotton, two layers,
[02:41:55.720 --> 02:41:59.480]   one one layer of either chiffon or silk in between.
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:01.400]   The silk or chiffon uses static
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.880]   to stop aerosolized particles
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.560]   and the cotton on both sides.
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:08.360]   Protects the people around you from the
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:10.760]   spume from your coughing,
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:12.760]   but also when I wear it with my
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:15.400]   mask fitter,
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:18.520]   I also am only breathing through the mask.
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:20.200]   And I believe that gives me,
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:21.640]   according to the research,
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:23.640]   I read it close to N95,
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:26.680]   95% protection against aerosolized particles.
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:31.080]   So you can also do that with a fitter with a surgical mask,
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:33.160]   which I think is going to give you an N95 as well.
[02:42:34.040 --> 02:42:35.240]   So these are inexpensive.
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:36.360]   These are disposable though,
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:37.240]   so they're not really good on the mask.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:38.360]   Maybe you don't want it.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.760]   Yes, but...
[02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:43.160]   Because The New York Times has a fascinating story,
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:44.280]   and it's just a theory.
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:45.400]   Yes.
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:49.000]   But the theory is that masks being imperfect
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.040]   let a little bit of the virus.
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:53.320]   And we know that you need a major low.
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:54.440]   Nothing's 100%.
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:59.400]   So enough in that it creates a kind of crude vaccine.
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:00.280]   That's a very ovation.
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:02.040]   Yeah, very ovation.
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:02.840]   This is...
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:03.160]   Yeah.
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:03.640]   And then...
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:05.480]   I learned about this on Peter the Great.
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:06.920]   Even if it's not a vaccine,
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:10.200]   it is the case that you will have a much milder
[02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:12.840]   case of it if you get a smaller dose.
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:14.360]   Give a smaller viral load.
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:14.760]   Yes.
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:17.080]   And it's unknown whether it provides any
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:19.000]   preventative effect,
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.600]   but it certainly is known to be a less serious viral load.
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:23.640]   I think with the fitter,
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:26.680]   and this is worn a lot of times in medical offices,
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:28.360]   you'll see these in dental practices a lot,
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:31.720]   that seals what would normally be open sides
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:33.240]   on a paper surgical mask.
[02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:35.320]   But you know what?
[02:43:35.320 --> 02:43:36.120]   I like that wear.
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:36.760]   It's beautiful.
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:38.520]   It's beautiful.
[02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:40.440]   It's very comfortable.
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.040]   Shop w-a-y-r-e.com.
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:45.480]   I guess they make clothing as well.
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:48.520]   But they also make masks.
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:50.600]   So there you go.
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:52.840]   And I'm not trying to poo poo carstons things.
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:53.400]   I just like...
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:56.040]   Like I really need some...
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:56.760]   No, you're right.
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:01.000]   Carstons got a little bit into the burning man side
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:01.720]   of masking.
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:02.760]   Yeah.
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:05.480]   The steampunk masks.
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:05.720]   Yeah.
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:09.400]   And I think we can safely say,
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:12.120]   despite the politics of the whole thing,
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:16.520]   that every serious scientist degrees masks
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:17.800]   are effective.
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:19.880]   They reduce, they flatten the curve,
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:22.920]   they reduce your chance of infecting somebody else,
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:25.080]   and asymptomatic individual affecting people.
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:27.320]   And they may even, if worn properly,
[02:44:27.320 --> 02:44:29.080]   and maintain properly protect you
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:31.160]   from people in your environment.
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:32.600]   And so we, everybody at TWIT,
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:33.640]   is always masked.
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:35.320]   John is masked right now.
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:36.760]   The only person who's not as me
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:39.160]   when I'm in either this part of the studio
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:40.040]   or in my office.
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:44.440]   And these, this I can wear forever.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:46.200]   This is very comfortable.
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:48.760]   I usually wear it with a...
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:51.560]   I don't have it with me, the face shield.
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:53.160]   So I think that helps a little bit.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:56.200]   And I like the fact that it keeps strangers away.
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:59.240]   And you can hear me pretty well, right?
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:00.680]   Yeah.
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:01.960]   I don't sound muffled to it.
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:05.160]   Is this the longest show we've ever made?
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:06.280]   No, not even close.
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:08.920]   Well, if we do it, three more minutes, right, John?
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:13.000]   Five more, we'd have to do five more minutes.
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:13.560]   I'm not.
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:14.280]   It's okay.
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:15.640]   I don't want to just set a record though.
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:19.640]   I have concerto in head for Stacy.
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:20.120]   Oh, wait me.
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:22.600]   I need a drink.
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:25.880]   I've been recording and performing since 6.30 today.
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:29.160]   Well, this was my easy week, Stacy.
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:33.160]   This week I was only on Zoom today for eight hours, last week was 11.
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:34.440]   You know, if you would like,
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:37.480]   I will be glad to make this show a lot shorter from now on.
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:38.840]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:39.800]   I don't want you to stop.
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:40.280]   No, I enjoy it.
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:41.560]   That's...
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:42.440]   I'll go down to Stacy.
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:43.640]   Honestly, I don't really hear her answer.
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:44.120]   I enjoy it.
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:47.080]   I make it long only because I don't want to stop.
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:50.440]   But I can be disciplined.
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:52.520]   Stacy, is there anybody left listening now?
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:52.760]   No.
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:56.600]   No, we could say anything we want at this point,
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:57.880]   because they've all disappeared.
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:45:59.720]   Anybody out there?
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:03.400]   Cricuts, I hear crickets.
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:05.480]   I was on my college radio station.
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:05.960]   Yeah.
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:08.680]   And I offered $20 to the first person who would call in.
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:09.160]   Nobody called in.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:09.800]   Nobody called in.
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:12.600]   Wait, did Aunt go away because,
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:14.040]   Aunt, what is your thought here?
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:17.000]   How long would you like to show it to be, sir?
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:17.880]   I'm not going anywhere.
[02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:18.600]   I'm just watching.
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:21.880]   Like two hours feels like a good show,
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:24.200]   unless there's like a lot of news.
[02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:24.920]   This is fun.
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:27.560]   We had to think of the fun we would have lost in the last hour.
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:32.120]   The whole, the whole carneck thing would have been lost to posterity.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:37.000]   I mean, Stacy, how dare you steal that joy from history?
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.600]   That's true.
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:41.320]   I mean, apparently several people in the chat room were like,
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:44.120]   "Carneck, who is that?"
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.120]   So I don't feel so awesome.
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:49.640]   There is the course existential question that if a podcast is produced,
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:52.440]   but no one listens, does it matter?
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:53.560]   Is it a podcast?
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:56.840]   It doesn't make any noise.
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:59.160]   Or is it just a ridiculous phone call?
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.280]   "Starden Burton, hot and bought."
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:07.800]   It is time to say, farewell to our friend Stacy Higginbotham,
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:11.000]   she is the star of StacyOnIOT.com.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:14.680]   Follow her at Gigastacy on the Twitter.
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:15.880]   Keep up on our events.
[02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:18.520]   She's, are you got a new one coming up anytime soon?
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:20.760]   Oh, I'm announcing it.
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:22.360]   Oh, tomorrow.
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:22.760]   Yay!
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:23.560]   It is.
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:24.120]   Ow.
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:24.680]   It is.
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:25.880]   You can have a sneak pre-
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:28.200]   See, I've lost words.
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:28.680]   That's sweet.
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:29.720]   I'll tell you about it next week.
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:31.720]   Well, I'll have a sneak peek later on.
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:36.200]   Aunt Pruitt, host of Fans on Habergegody.
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.160]   He believes in love.
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:44.520]   Oh, he's, are you doing your next hands on photography?
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:46.600]   You're going to do studio food, right?
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:51.240]   I'm going to show you how to create that shot right there in your home food.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:53.240]   Oh, I want to watch that.
[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:54.120]   Do you do product?
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:57.400]   Is that going to be equivalent to shooting products and making them look pretty?
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:57.880]   And?
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:47:58.520]   Yes, ma'am.
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:00.200]   Keep wearing those sunglasses.
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:01.400]   Don't ever take them home.
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:02.280]   Single light.
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:03.080]   Never take them home.
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:03.640]   I love it.
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:04.120]   I love it.
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:05.080]   I'm tuning in.
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:05.640]   Yay!
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:07.800]   My vote is terrible.
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:08.120]   Hop!
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:11.160]   There's a new show of Hop Every When.
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:12.040]   Friday, Thursday?
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:16.120]   Hop is every Thursday at about two o'clock.
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:16.360]   Nice.
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:17.560]   Pacific.
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:20.040]   The glasses have confused the focus on your camera.
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:20.440]   I know.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.320]   It's, it says,
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:22.600]   I want love.
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:25.720]   Whatever love is, I want to focus on that.
[02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:27.880]   Wait, when is your wellness on?
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:29.160]   Because that one is delightful.
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:30.760]   Hands on wellness too is another great one.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:32.680]   When do you do that, Anne?
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:35.480]   What time?
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:39.560]   Hands on wellness is about, I believe it's 11 a.m.
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:40.760]   Pacific on Fridays.
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:42.440]   So Thursday, it's hop.
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:44.440]   Friday, it's how.
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:45.720]   That's right.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:47.080]   And you just,
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:47.560]   and also,
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:49.000]   we're the mass people.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:49.400]   Thank you.
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:51.880]   As you can see with my model behind me there,
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:52.600]   we're in here in the mass.
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:53.880]   You can pay yours too.
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:57.160]   We are all about the masks here at Twit.
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:48:59.320]   That is, there's no dissent about that.
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:02.040]   Jeff Jarvis, however,
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:04.200]   will be seen in the next Trump boat parade.
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:06.920]   Without him.
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:07.480]   Hauling green.
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:07.960]   He's going,
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:09.320]   you look like you're going to Sturgis,
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:10.440]   to be honest with you.
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:12.520]   You'll find him at buzzmachine.com
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:14.840]   at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:16.840]   And don't forget he's the director.
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:17.720]   How could we ever forget?
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:20.360]   The Town Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:23.880]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:24.840]   It's the School of Journalism.
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:28.360]   At the City of University of New York, New York.
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:31.160]   Thank you everybody for putting up with us.
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:34.600]   This is always my favorite day of the week,
[02:49:34.600 --> 02:49:36.360]   because I get to do this show with you guys.
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:36.840]   Thank you.
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:39.720]   Former TV guide critic, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:41.800]   Thank you everybody.
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:42.600]   We do twig.
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:44.440]   Well, it's, you know,
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.160]   it's about 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:49.960]   That would be 2100 UTC.
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:52.120]   You can watch the live version of the show,
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:55.480]   which, believe it or not, is actually 7 hours long at Twig.
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:59.400]   Twig.tv/live.
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:01.080]   You can go here, Stacey.
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:02.440]   He snores a lot of fun.
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:04.440]   Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two.
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:06.120]   Angry Stacey, attack the mic.
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:10.920]   If you can't do a live thing,
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:12.440]   you can always do the on-demand show,
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:16.280]   because it is a podcast at Twig.tv/Twig or YouTube,
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:19.000]   or subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.800]   So you get it the minute it's available after we finish.
[02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:26.600]   Thank you everybody for putting up with us for this long marathon.
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:28.120]   We love you. Stay safe.
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:30.360]   We want to see you next week on This Week in Google.
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:31.000]   Bye-bye.

[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:39.880]   and really dive deep into what it can do for you
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:42.360]   and how it can improve your quality of life,
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:44.920]   whether it be tips and tricks on how to use it better,
[02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:46.760]   whether it can be little known secrets
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:49.080]   that open up a world of possibilities,
[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:52.360]   so many topics to dive into, including your emails.
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:55.960]   Subscribe by going to Twig.tv/HOA.
