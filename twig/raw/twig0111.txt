[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.120]   and the cloud and today.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.840]   Yahoo.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840]   I think a little bit.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.080]   Anyway, joining us now, Gina Trapani of smarterweird.org.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.640]   And of course, think up app.com.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.960]   Great to have you, Gina.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.760]   Great to be here.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.000]   Good to see you.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840]   To my right, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   And his new book is out September 27th, public parts.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.040]   That's exciting.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.200]   Your copy is all of my books.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.880]   Oh, well, then I won't click this preorder on Amazon.com.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.200]   Although at $17, it's quite a deal.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.720]   That's the hardcover Amazon price.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.320]   Kindle Edition 1299, that's great.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.160]   September 27th.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.840]   And your publisher obviously knows
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.640]   how to use the Amazon because you've got the zoom in.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.880]   You've got the read it.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.440]   You've got a video related media on the page.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.040]   I mean, you're working it here.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.920]   You're working it.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.720]   Next week, I'll put up the introduction online.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.920]   Do you do this or does your publisher--
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.680]   Do you do that?
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.320]   OK, good.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.760]   Good, good, good.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.160]   You wouldn't let me anywhere near it.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.720]   Well, no, I just--
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.080]   sales like publishers do less and less these days.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.440]   And it's almost like your job to publicize the book.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   But you got a good publisher, obviously.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.680]   That's great.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.960]   You got to get the good publisher.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.120]   Yes.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.960]   By the way, Gene, I was unpacking my books
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.080]   as I moved into my office.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.040]   And I found my complete guide to Google Wave autographed
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.960]   by Gina Trippani.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.160]   And that is going in a very special spot on the show.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.360]   That's computer history museum.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   It is, exactly.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.440]   It's very there.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.840]   I'll put it right in between the Minitel computer, which
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.520]   is sitting right behind me, which has just
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.280]   been discontinued in France.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.240]   And Cedric Engrond from TF1--
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.480]   or TCI, rather, brought me that.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.440]   And the Amiga 1000 that we had in Lisbon.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.840]   And somebody's bringing us an Osborne
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.640]   and a 20th anniversary Macintosh.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.240]   So we're going to actually have in here
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.040]   a pretty decent technology museum.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.120]   That's really cool.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.600]   I'm excited about that.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.960]   Kevin Marks is also here.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.080]   Kevin is a technology museum in his own right.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.560]   He's worked at all the biggies.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.120]   Currently a sales force.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   But he's worked at British Telecom previously.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.880]   Yeah, Google, before that.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.720]   Apple, before that.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.960]   You've been everywhere.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.360]   We just figured it out, though.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.320]   Never at Yahoo or Microsoft.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.920]   That's true.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.280]   Maybe I should come and get them a call.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.960]   I think it's too late, although I understand.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.680]   They might be looking for a CEO right now.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.000]   I love Carol Bartz.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.480]   I'm going to put the name for it.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.320]   Really.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.240]   Even in departure, Carol Bartz manages
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.080]   to send a little FU to the Yahoo board yesterday
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.240]   sending from her iPad, and, "missive to all the Yahoo
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.800]   employees," saying, "I've just been fired by phone."
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.960]   Best announcement email ever.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.040]   No kidding.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   Short to the point.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.320]   And he's a little knife at the end.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   Little jab in there.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.680]   Nice working with you.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.600]   As Carol Swisher reports out, she
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.640]   was the first to publish the email.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.960]   Although everybody got a copy because everybody at Yahoo
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.480]   got it and forwarded it on to TechCrunch and everybody else.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.040]   But she pointed out that the chairman of the board
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   and Ms. Bartz were in flight at the time.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.680]   So there was no way they could do it in person.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.800]   They were going to the opposite sides of the country.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.480]   Because they could have waited a day or two.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.400]   No.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.920]   No, has to happen right now.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.440]   Why did it happen so quickly?
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.280]   And why don't they have a replacement ready?
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.000]   They don't have a strategy.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.360]   The company's going to be run by its CFO temporarily.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.040]   But he's advised by an advisory board of a dozen people
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.520]   from all different walks of the company.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.400]   And, of course, Jerry and David, it's just a mess.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   I tweeted in Google+ today, what would you do with AOL
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.760]   and Yahoo?
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.440]   And I didn't see a single answer.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.760]   I just got a lot of jokes.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.680]   Yeah, even I joked.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   I don't know what I'd do.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.400]   I called him Roadkill on the information super highway.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.600]   Because I do think AOL and Yahoo both are outmoded.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.440]   It happens.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.480]   I compared him to Prodigy, CompuServe Mini-Tel.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.640]   Technology leaves you behind.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.120]   And it's-- few are the technology companies
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.280]   that can devise a second act.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   The whole notion of a portal, the whole notion
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.760]   of being the gatekeeper of--
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.680]   it's ignored the end-to-end architecture of the net.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.720]   And it tried to replicate the old centralized architecture
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.520]   of media that we had and services that we had.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.280]   And that's what's so fundamentally different here
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   is that the net is end-to-end and it's distributed
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.720]   and it's all kinds of different things
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   that people just don't understand.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.040]   And none of the CEOs of Yahoo has ever understood that.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   Doesn't that concern you?
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.280]   These are two big content companies.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.800]   In fact, AOL is one of the few companies investing
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.600]   in journalism, I guess you could call it investing
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.120]   in journalism.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.680]   They have an investigative journalism fund.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.400]   I mean, isn't this not good?
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.880]   Yeah, but you know what, Leo?
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.360]   I've been arguing lately I wrote a treatise
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.240]   about the link economy a while back, which will really
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.160]   put you to sleep fast, arguing that we in content
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.560]   think the value is in the content and it's not.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.640]   It's in the relationships.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.880]   And if I told the story before, your stop,
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   I went to lunch with the former president of a big network
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.840]   news operation who said, you know, Google and Facebook
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   and all these companies use our steel to make their cars.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.120]   They don't value our content.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.800]   And I said, no, it's the contrary.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.280]   Mark Zuckerberg values more content than you do.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.680]   All you value is what you make.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.960]   You take all your value is encased in your content.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.080]   And he sees that there's value in content made
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.280]   by lots of people and he extracts that value
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.480]   in a different way.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.760]   So he encourages more content for more people in more ways.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.840]   And it's a fundamental architectural shift, I think,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.800]   that these poor guys don't get.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.520]   But they have the mind share and they have this user base.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.920]   I mean, I understand that I saw your Google+ post, Jeff,
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.720]   and everyone just said, oh, just toss AOL and Yahoo,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.280]   whatever, that they can't change.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.000]   They've got no plan.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.280]   They're totally worthless.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.800]   But the fact is that they're two of the biggest internet
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.240]   companies out there and they have--
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.000]   Still.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.280]   They could turn things around, right?
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.800]   I mean, if they did turn themselves into a platform
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.880]   for content creation and sharing, I mean,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.360]   like the internet is one, but they have a distribution channel.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.000]   I remember the one time that a life hacker post made it
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.160]   onto the Yahoo front page.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.640]   And it was insane.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.000]   I'd never seen the kind of page that we got.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.040]   And there's a lot of power there.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.000]   I mean, it sounds like what you said, what they need,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.600]   is a plan and they need better leadership.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.640]   I think Om said, now that they've fired Bartz,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.440]   they should fire the board, kind of start all over again.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   It sounds like just an issue of leadership and strategy.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.720]   But they're not totally--
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.680]   I mean, they're both huge brands with huge mind
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.360]   share and users.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.280]   They could do something good.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.480]   It's funny that we're lumping Yahoo and AOL together
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.520]   on this one.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.560]   Because Yahoo's the one whose CEO resigned.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.400]   I mean, AOL's in a little bit of trouble
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.000]   with the Huffington Post, Mike Errington blow up.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   But I think in some ways, they strengthened their brand
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.720]   a little bit.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.720]   Well, I take it back.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.760]   They weakened their brand with the investment
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.280]   in the Crunch Fund.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.760]   But I think Ariana stepping forth--
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.440]   this is my opinion.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.640]   I'd love to hear yours-- and saying, we fired Mike Errington.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.280]   He's out.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.320]   We're not going to condense this.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.040]   Now, it looks like there's two different AOLs.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.200]   But don't you think Ariana did the right thing there?
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.840]   I think-- I got some sympathy for Mike and Tech
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.240]   crunches there.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.320]   Because lots of-- everyone else is doing it too.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.040]   He pointed to the list of investments
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.480]   the New York Times has in startups, which includes automatic
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.280]   and John Borthwick's beta works and things like that.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.480]   But they're both invested.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.920]   They're each invested in daylight.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.120]   We're out of a partner.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.720]   Both the better times and Ariana invested in the same company.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.040]   Right.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.400]   Oh, Malik runs a venture fund and a very successful tech
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:45.960]   blog as well.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.800]   So it's not like Ariana is proposing something that's
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   completely outlandish.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.720]   It's just that his personality is such that everyone--
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.240]   That's true.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.680]   gets wound up by him.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.000]   I mean, I think it's reprehensible.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.440]   And we don't invest in any companies we cover.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.920]   But we do take advertising from companies we cover.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.800]   And some have said, well, how is that different?
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.480]   I think it's substantially different.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.200]   And it's unfortunately the way it has to be.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.280]   Media-- free media has to be paid for somehow.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.760]   I really dislike the argument that Mike uses
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.120]   and some of the other tech crunch writers have used
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.840]   that as long as it's OK, as long as we disclose,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.720]   I just feel like there is such a thing as--
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.440]   do you not think that there's such a thing as an inappropriate
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.720]   conflict of interest?
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.600]   Well, Kevin's point is that you have conflict.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.720]   Everyone has conflicts.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.600]   And the primary solution to that is transparency.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.240]   Well, I agree.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.160]   You need transparency.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   But isn't there such a thing as an inappropriate conflict
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.640]   of interest?
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.760]   And what would that be if there is?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.680]   I think we're trying to--
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.080]   I don't want to seem like I'm Mike's apologist here.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.040]   But remember how he started TechCrunch?
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.480]   He was a venture capitalist who wrote about new companies
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.800]   to get information, to shed information,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.400]   and to give him a brand.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.560]   He said, I'm an investor, and I want to know more.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   And the best way to do it is to write the blog.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.800]   And so from day one, he was doing this.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.240]   You're right.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.360]   This is not a change.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.400]   And from day one, he said, I'm not a journalist.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.360]   I talked to him at Disrupt in New York
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.760]   and tried to make him take on the mantle of journalism
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.480]   and say, take it on and prove it, change it.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.680]   No, no, I'm not a journalist.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.640]   I'm not a journalism.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.240]   Perhaps I understand that better now.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.000]   And what I think is happening here
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.760]   is that we're going to find all kinds of entities that
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.480]   gather and share information for their own purposes
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   and their own good that is useful to others, for others of us,
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.440]   to curate and link to and whatever, who, in fact,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.040]   are not trying to do journalism.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.760]   What complicates this is that it's
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.000]   taken over by AOL as Ariana is pushing that--
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.120]   or is taken over by AOL and then merges with Haffy to Post.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.400]   Ariana is pushing journalism.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.120]   But Ariana, too, does things that people say
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.360]   ain't journalism either.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.680]   But in fact, do spread a lot of information.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.720]   So I think, Leo, you're right to hone in on the question
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.880]   of conflict.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.720]   Let's talk about that for a second.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.080]   Who's to lose more in an issue of conflict?
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.160]   I mean, if David Carr, or Cara Swisher, who
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.680]   smashed Ariana for this, they lose credibility.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.720]   They lose the key value.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.680]   That's true.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.440]   But Ariana, also, if you find that he's basically screwing
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.640]   over the people he invests in using this in bad ways,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.480]   he loses direct investment.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.400]   So he has the same investment in having
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.840]   to hold on to trust credibility or gain it, I think,
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.440]   that anyone else.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.760]   And so my only point here is that--
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:37.840]   Well, what if the big score is funding a startup,
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   then pumping it up with TechCrunch and turning it?
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.520]   What if that's the billion-dollar score?
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.480]   That's what he has to gain.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.240]   But at some point, doesn't that bubble get revealed?
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.440]   Well, of course it gets revealed.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.760]   But by then, he's walking away with a billion dollars.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.240]   See, here's my problem.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.520]   I know who stands up for the reader,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.360]   who is making a decision, whether it is to buy a product,
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.920]   to invest, to use a product, and is making that decision
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.040]   based on information that is not objective.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.600]   Now, these guys will say, well, not nobody's objective,
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.000]   and the reader is competent to judge the difference
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.480]   and let the chips fall where they may.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.560]   It seems to me there's an opportunity, then,
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.280]   to provide information for people that's reliable and trustworthy
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.160]   and not compromised by an investment in the company.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.440]   You're providing that information?
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.440]   Absolutely.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.000]   Absolutely.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.560]   The question is, is that area in the business or not?
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.600]   I don't care what Mike Arrington does.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.120]   He could do whatever he wants.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.960]   It's not my job to police Mike Arrington or Cara Swisher
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.160]   or Gigah Ome or anybody else.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.960]   It's my job to police my own endeavors.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.880]   And I personally think it's a reprehensible behavior,
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.040]   and I think that people shouldn't read those blogs
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.760]   if they feel, you know, I guess they know that they can't trust it.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.040]   I just, I know my feeling now when I go to TechCrunch,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.800]   every single article I'm going, well, yeah,
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.200]   I wonder who's got a stake in that pie.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   Did you always wonder that?
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.600]   Not as much as I do now.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.360]   I should have always wondered it, it turns out.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.320]   Well, no, I mean, they will disclose on the poster
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.080]   if there is a stake.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.400]   They do do that in the same way that you can't say it.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.280]   Yeah, but I don't want to have to read every article
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.680]   and parse it and try to say, OK, now, oh, this one's trustworthy.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.160]   Oh, this one's not trustworthy.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.080]   I say, throw out the whole site because I'm not going to--
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.760]   it's not my job to figure out which articles are trustworthy.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.560]   Well, but having them posted exactly the same,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.520]   they have a bunch of people--
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.160]   I don't read them either.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.680]   I agree with them.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.800]   I don't read them either.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.720]   I mean, the thing is, I, you know,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   what three are you trying to employ?
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.920]   It's a bunch of journalists that I like reading,
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.840]   and I'm going to keep reading them because I respect them
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.280]   as journalists.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.360]   And some of them have worked other places before
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.640]   and moved around and some of them have started up.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.880]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.720]   I will read M.G. Seagler.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.320]   Yeah, I will tell you.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.640]   And I consider that I read M.G. Seagler, not TechCrunch.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.680]   I read Alexia, and I read Alexia because I know them,
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.280]   and I trust them.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.400]   But I'm more worried about our audience
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.360]   who are finding fewer and fewer venues where they
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.600]   can find reliable technology information.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.960]   Is it really fewer and fewer?
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.560]   I think it's more and more.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.160]   Well, no, I'm not saying there aren't more and more venues,
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.320]   but if they are all compromised, everybody seems to agree.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.720]   Everybody's got a bias.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.680]   But that's-- if we get to hear from everybody,
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.480]   that's not so bad.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.760]   The problem before was when you actually
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.800]   had gatekeepers who would decide what you got to hear,
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.000]   that was much more problematic.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.880]   I think Dan Gilmore said this week
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.560]   is that the only gatekeeping now is you.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.600]   You get to choose which sources you listen to and trust.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.880]   And that responsibility is put back on you.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.280]   You can't just delegate that to some suppose,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.640]   that you're a board, that you assume is doing that job for.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.280]   You've got to look at the good exam and the bias
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.400]   and everything you read.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.000]   That's a good thing to learn to do.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.800]   Yeah, well, I mean, and that's always been the case.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.600]   And we've found that out about the New York Times.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.240]   Although, you asked me a good question, Jeff,
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.480]   which I don't want to dodge, which is what do you read?
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.120]   And it's getting harder.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.480]   I mean, I still trust the New York Times.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.840]   I know they have investments, but I
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.480]   don't consider, I know they have such a strong ethic,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.280]   that I don't consider that their reporters are influenced
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.200]   by their investments.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.480]   And if I'm proven wrong on that, then I'm really
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.640]   going to be devastated.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.760]   Well, one of the great ironies of this is,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.320]   and I want to hear you answer the same question
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.200]   in a second, Gina.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.280]   But of course, I'll get in first,
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.400]   is that I had a huge blow up with Ariantin
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.120]   at the online news association in Washington
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.720]   about five years ago when he claimed
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.480]   that the New York Times in a public forum there
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.600]   could not possibly have been positive about a company
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.080]   he had written about if they weren't in their pocket.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.440]   And I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.640]   that's going too far.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.600]   And the irony is he didn't reveal the time
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.200]   that this company-- I forget the company--
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.400]   was a competitor of day life, and both Ariantin
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.200]   and the New York Times had investment in day life.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.040]   And I'm involved with day life.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.200]   And he and I really kind of came to blows
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.040]   and took a few years for us, not as famous as yours, Leo,
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.120]   took us for years for us to kind of make up.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.520]   And the irony is that he accused the New York Times
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.640]   of a level of conflict.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.120]   The New York Times has now accused him of.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.520]   And for neither is there in my mind a smoking gun.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.800]   And so I think Kevin's right here is that,
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.880]   like it or not, the responsibility--
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.560]   everyone's not just a journalist.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.360]   No, everyone's an editor.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.880]   And that we all have to judge the sources.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.080]   And the truth is we always have.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.600]   We just have fewer sources to judge.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.920]   And now we have more.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.280]   And so now sometimes when the original company--
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.400]   when there's news about Facebook or Google,
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.800]   what do we often point to?
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.600]   We often point to the company's own sites.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.520]   And when they do a good job of revealing stuff
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.480]   in a way that we find open and trustworthy,
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.480]   they get the first word.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.160]   I guess I sound like a kind of pathetic Pollyanna going,
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.480]   but no, but they've got to be trustworthy.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.880]   Aren't they trustworthy?
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.720]   Oh, no.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.600]   Poor Leo.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.000]   I'm so depressed.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   You know, I read TechCrunch with a giant grain of salt,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.600]   especially when Errington, or really anyone other than MG,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.320]   is the author.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.240]   And I think that at this point, most readers probably do.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.640]   I mean, we have checked TechCrunch articles
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.440]   in the rundown here.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.400]   I mean, I think that it's not going to be my first source
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.160]   of opinion, and I often disagree with them.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.880]   And Errington drives me a little crazy.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.120]   They've got great scoops, though.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.800]   We can't avoid reading them because they get the scopes.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.320]   They do.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.840]   They report things that other organizations that
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.480]   have codes of ethics or lack of conflict like the Times can't do.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.560]   They can get me information that the Times doesn't or can't
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.160]   because it hasn't been vetted or confirmed in different ways.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.440]   So I think, I don't know, I kind of
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.600]   feel like this is on the reader to decide.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.120]   And I think that TechCrunch readers do know,
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.920]   and they do disclose right in the post,
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.680]   in line in the post, if there's a conflict or an investment.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.280]   In this whole blow up with Errington,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.720]   I felt the people I felt the worst for were his editorial staff.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.160]   I felt so bad for his bloggers.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.080]   And I think that was just me sort of right back to my life.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.480]   I think they feel pretty bad.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.880]   Yeah, they feel pretty bad right now.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.160]   Yeah, I mean, it just seemed like an epic.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.360]   Well, and it's so funny because he gets fired in and he quits.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.800]   He gets reinstated.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.640]   Well, what's the latest?
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.600]   He's been reinstated.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.040]   Well, I think right afterwards he was.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.560]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.760]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.680]   Ariana fired him.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.160]   But then Tim said he was still an employee.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.240]   Well, he's because Tim has a $10 million investment,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.560]   half of the total investment of Crunch Fund.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.840]   But that's not an editorial employee.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.760]   Mike no longer writes for Tech Crunch.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.600]   Right, right, right.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.640]   There was an unpaid--
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.800]   Mike under the bus, and then Mike got in the driver's seat
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.000]   and he drove over Ariana.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.280]   It's just so ugly.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.680]   And it's really--
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.520]   And Mike's ultimately made him to Ariana.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.200]   Yes.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.680]   This is our definition of independence.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.080]   It's hard for a company to then kiss and make up
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.760]   when you undercut a key executive like that.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.000]   So it's a real no-go-and-back situation,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.160]   I think, for both sides.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.400]   It's just ugly.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.000]   And I guess that's why we're blumping AOL with Yahoo.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.720]   Exactly.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.440]   Because they really aren't the same situation.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.080]   AOL still has Tim Armstrong.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.160]   They're saying, you know, ironically,
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.360]   you wouldn't have-- you've asked me 10 years ago,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.560]   who's more likely to be around in 2011 AOL or Yahoo?
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.560]   I wouldn't have said AOL would be the vital company.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.360]   And Yahoo's struggling.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.880]   It's been an epic public drama.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.120]   And at times, I just want to close my eyes and just say,
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.760]   aren't you people all just grown-ups?
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.680]   Can't you just get in a room and settle it?
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.160]   At the same time that having this discussion in public,
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.600]   I'm sure that Jeff has been loving it.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.520]   You know, it was like you really get to hear all sides of it.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.440]   And I felt bad for Ariana and his bloggers being like,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.040]   this is the first we ever heard of Crunchfun
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.400]   was when the Times article published.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.960]   And we really have no idea what's going on.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.200]   But you know, Mike started this site.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.160]   And you know, the thing is, a tech crunch really is about Mike.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.600]   And you know, there are a lot of things
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.600]   I don't love about Mike, but his passion and drive
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.720]   behind the site--
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.440]   I agree.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.880]   And just his passion in general, even if it's totally
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.560]   wrong-headed and crazy at times, is something.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.320]   And I think it's really neat to see what it is.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.600]   I got to say, the day I heard that AOL bought TechCrunch,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.280]   I saw-- I could see.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.720]   Couldn't we all just kind of see this day?
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.520]   It's just like drama playing out.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.000]   And immediately, Mike starts slamming in gadget at AOL's
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.480]   number one property.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   AOL doesn't defend in gadget to Polsky leaves,
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.640]   Nieleye leaves.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.160]   And then AOL sends out a confidential memo,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.640]   which TechCrunch immediately publishes.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.520]   I mean, the drama just builds an union.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.800]   You could just see Mike going, fire me, fire me, fire me,
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.640]   fire me, fire me, fire me.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.920]   And I mean, it's just--
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.200]   I don't know what really went on.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.800]   And it's just-- you know what?
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.320]   This is the equivalent of--
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.360]   you know, I don't know what our Paris Hilton's scandal.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   That's true.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:53.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.920]   Some frus will talk about it.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.120]   These are our celebrities.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.680]   This is what we have for Kardashian.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.320]   This and Eric Schmidt.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.920]   Eric Schmidt was at Dreamforce Mark Benney
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.520]   off the CEO of your company, Kevin Marks Disclaimer there.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.920]   I guess, interviewed, hair Schmidt about a number of things.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.000]   And here's this segment.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.040]   Here's the portion of the interview in which Benney off
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.160]   asks Eric Schmidt about Android.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   When we were working on Unix in the 1980s--
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.800]   He's talking about novele.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.640]   His original company.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.000]   Clever enough to think of a strategy that
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   would maintain fragmentation, avoid fragmentation,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.760]   but allow for open time.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.480]   By the way, that's an Eric Schmidtism.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.000]   Maintain fragmentation.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.400]   That is avoid fragmentation.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   All right, then.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.840]   I've seen that.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.600]   By which I mean maintain it, by which I mean avoid it.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.880]   Model for that.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.200]   What they do is, although Android is open source,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.920]   and you can do anything you want to it,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.720]   if you want to sort of use the brand and so forth,
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.160]   you have to be able to run the application store.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.200]   That's the requirement.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.440]   And that's such a powerful incentive
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.360]   that it keeps all the people who would otherwise go one way
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.120]   and the other in fragment Android.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.240]   Like Amazon.com.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.680]   Together.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.840]   So rather than using a contract, which is the old,
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.920]   if I could say, Microsoft model, or a no contract
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.560]   and hope for the best, which is an Eric optimist model,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.720]   now we have a pretty strong carrot and stick model
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.480]   where the people who really want the benefit of the platform
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.760]   have a high incentive to maintain API compatibility.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.520]   So on the one hand--
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.520]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.040]   Now, Amazon's doing exactly the opposite.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.360]   And he knew it when he gave this speech, I believe.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.000]   They're using Android, but they're
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.720]   using the Amazon store.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.640]   They've completely reskinned it in this new tablet, which
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.400]   MG Seeker, by the way, got the scoop on.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   He got the scoop on, right?
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.520]   He was able to play with it.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.320]   He was the only Tucker Porter who was able to use it.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.520]   Which is actually both a testament to him
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.080]   and to the power of TechCrunch, we should add.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.600]   But that was the point that Eric was making there.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.800]   I've told about this before.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.240]   I think I wrote a post on this back in January
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.760]   that Android is two things.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.320]   Android is an open source stack that
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.480]   is being used by consumer electronic companies
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.080]   to build all kinds of things.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.480]   And Android is also the Google Apps, and the Google Apps
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.160]   store, and the Maps, and the Gmail,
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.920]   and the other pieces of Google controls,
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.560]   which make up a big chunk of the utility of the experience.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.560]   I agree, but it's not much of a stick.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.520]   But it's the stick they've used so far
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.560]   to try and converge the cell phones.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.640]   And I suspect they'll be using that a bit more.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.360]   But yeah, Amazon doesn't need that, right?
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.040]   That's true.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.560]   That's true.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.880]   You can put a Lola, an LG, and Samsung do need it, I guess.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.320]   Yes.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.520]   But Amazon's playing a different game.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.120]   Amazon's in a different business.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   Amazon is in the business of selling media primarily.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.280]   The devices are a means to that end.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.560]   And in some ways, their tablet is more of a response
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.120]   to the nook than it is to the iPad.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.280]   Because they already sell stuff onto the iPad,
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.720]   but they're worried about Apple taking the control there.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.920]   So this gives them another lever here.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.360]   So what they've done is basically what
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.520]   Barnes and Nub are doing with the nook, except extended a bit more.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.200]   And they've replaced more of the Google
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.800]   stack with their own stuff because they've
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.880]   got their own app store there as well.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.640]   And they've also got their own media store that
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.520]   will be better integrated than the existing Google one.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.280]   So it will make sense as an audio video device as well.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.000]   But Kevin, I think the question that Leo's
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.480]   getting to here is, didn't Amazon just
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.320]   do to Eric Schmidt what Eric Schmidt said he didn't want done
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.360]   again, which is fragmented?
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.840]   Yes, he used the basis.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.800]   But then does Google get any benefit?
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.440]   Put it this way.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.320]   Does Google get any benefit out of Amazon using Android
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.040]   in its tablet?
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.880]   Yeah, well, yes, because they're still using the Android base.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.800]   They'll still be using the browser.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   Google will still probably be the default search engine,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.000]   unless Amazon wants to annoy its users.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.120]   So they'll still be getting a bunch of the value they get.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.160]   And that's a lot of the--
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.360]   Well, ironically, they get the value of the search,
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360]   no matter what OS.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.080]   I mean, I'm just a blackberry playbook used Google.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.840]   So you don't really need Android to get the benefit there.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.840]   Right.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.920]   Well, there was some people with a switch,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.640]   whether there was a Verizon phone that switched to being just
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:14.640]   a nice--
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   Big mistake.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.840]   Just to drive people crazy.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.800]   Users can switch it back.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.040]   And I think broadly, they come from with that,
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.280]   because it's the commoditize your compliments thing again.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   It's like, where does this company make their money?
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   They want to make the things that are complementary to that
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.880]   as cheap or free as possible.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.840]   So for Apple, they make their money
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.600]   from selling the physical devices.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.200]   So they want to make the content as cheap as free as possible
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.480]   so that they build the app store and the original iTunes
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.560]   audio video store to make sure that that content is available.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.840]   But they're happy to pass most of the revenue from that
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   through to the publishers to get the publishers on there.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.080]   Google cares about advertising and about searches happening.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.040]   Particularly, they really care about mobile searches,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.880]   because those are much higher value searches
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.720]   than the general searches, because there's
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.800]   a much like their call to action there.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.960]   So they're very keen on having that piece of the mobile devices.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.840]   And the tablets is part of that.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.160]   But I think the stress of Android is still mostly
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.120]   on the phone side.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.800]   And Amazon is in the media distribution business,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.280]   originally starting with physical media,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.360]   with selling books and other stuff over the net.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.320]   But now, moving strongly into selling digital stuff,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.960]   both with a Kindle and with the other audio videos,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.360]   stores their ramping up.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.800]   And now they've got their app store for Android
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.560]   to go along with that.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.080]   And making that the different one on the device
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.760]   and iterating on that, I think, is a sensible thing.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.720]   And to say, is this a fork of Android?
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.320]   I think that's a slight misnomer in that it will probably
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.800]   be one of the Android releases.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.600]   Part of the problem is that Google doesn't actually
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.720]   do its Android development in public the way it does.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.840]   It's WebKit or Chrome development in public
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.800]   the way Apple does its WebKit development in public.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.480]   There isn't a public source tree,
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.080]   except when they do a release.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.240]   And they haven't pushed out the latest versions yet.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   And so Amazon will be working from an older version.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.320]   But they could potentially pull in the updates into that.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.800]   And if they just built on top of that,
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.600]   rather than actually modifying the guts of it,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.320]   that should be no more--
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.520]   Well, here's another way to look at it.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.720]   They're not creating another device.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.240]   Gary V. just put up a video minutes ago on to Google+
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.640]   in which he argues-- and I have a washi,
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.000]   because I'm watching this, but just looking at the summary--
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.440]   he argues that Bezos is the next Steve Jobs.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:36.920]   Because of the one--
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.440]   I think you're right.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.960]   It has the DNA to do that.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.480]   So the irony here is did Google just help
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.800]   create a new Apple as a competitor?
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.200]   No, well, not the same way that Apple was a competitor.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.160]   No, something else.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.640]   Google benefits from Amazon doing an Android-based tablet
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.520]   in two ways.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.880]   First, way more people are going to use a tablet, right?
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.800]   Because Amazon's going to have huge reach.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.920]   The Kindle's super popular, so moving to Android is a great thing.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.560]   Mobile searches, like Kevin said.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.360]   And even if-- so it sounds like they're using a fork of Android
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.720]   2.2, and they're not collaborating with Google on it
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.560]   right now.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.120]   But if they're working on the open source code,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.480]   that means that Amazon is going to be contributing back
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.640]   to that core.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.440]   So there is going to be some collaboration there.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.640]   So Google is going to be able to benefit from some
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.600]   of Amazon's work and vice versa if they
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.560]   rebase their work on top of the next release of Android.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.880]   And that's all a good thing.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.120]   I mean, Google has-- there's Android, and then there's
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.640]   the Google experience Android.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.960]   And I think that Google's whole plan this entire time
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.480]   was to get different manufacturers to install Android,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.800]   even if it's not the Google Gmail, Google Market Android
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.920]   onto lots of devices.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.960]   When they count 550,000 activations a day,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.920]   they don't say half of these are Google experience and half
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.480]   of them aren't.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.520]   That's 550,000 period.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.000]   Right, Android.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.960]   And every one of them.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.040]   And I'm sure that they'll include the Amazon tablet.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.240]   Let's listen to a little bit more.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.880]   This is Eric Schmidt talking with Mark Benioff at last week's
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.680]   Dreamforce conference that was sponsored by Salesforce.com.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.400]   Be all like they have a choice.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.640]   And they really can.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.520]   But they also have a high incentive
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.240]   to stay within this boundary of compatibility.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.960]   And I think that's in many ways the legacy of Sun.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.480]   That these ideas were pioneered by Sun,
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.920]   but not fully implemented at Sun.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.560]   We weren't smart enough to see this kind of an approach,
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.280]   or maybe it wasn't available to us.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.480]   And I think that if you look at Android today--
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   Well, not all of the pieces were there, right?
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.120]   One of the great things that we've seen was HTML.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.240]   And the web browser, Sun, didn't have that.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.680]   We were still in the motif world and all
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.000]   these proprietary interfaces.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.680]   That made Sun so it made it too much its own box.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.000]   Wouldn't you say that that was a--
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.080]   An HTML5 is sort of the next leveler of the frame.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.440]   Give you the numbers in Android.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.120]   Android has about 550,000 phones are activated a day.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.920]   So that's a half a million phones per day.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.880]   You can do the math.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.040]   That number has grown in four months, doubled in four to five
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.280]   months.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.240]   So if that continues, it'll fill the planet, right?
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:11.760]   Yes.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.240]   It's not going to continue, I think.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.000]   So obviously it'll slow at some point.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.120]   Yes.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.920]   You can't have a billion activations a day.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.880]   I think it's not possible.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   But I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   And I think it's a very important thing to do with this.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   Microsoft dumped Internet Explorer to kill Netscape.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   They're dumping Android to kill other formed platforms, particularly iOS, by giving it away.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.880]   Does that seem an unfair characterization, Kevin?
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   Well, if you come from Microsoft's world where you could look at it like that,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   but the point is they're handing over control of it as well.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   By open sourcing it, they're saying anyone can build this,
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   anyone can do what Amazon has just done.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   But we have a carrot and a stick to keep you in order.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   There are other variants of Android.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   There's a build out in China that one of the social networks there has put together as a --
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   because they don't care about the Google infrastructure.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   They care about their infrastructure.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.880]   And so they've built another top half of Android that's based around that.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   And my suspicion is that Amazon may well -- is building a device.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   Sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if they released the stuff that they're using,
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.880]   so other people can build those devices too, because they don't actually care that much about the device.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   They care about having their store and their content on it.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   And it would make sense for them to do something similar to what Google has done with Android,
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   say, "Okay, we'll give you -- if you don't want to sign up with Google's terms,
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.880]   we'll give you the Amazon Android top half on more favorable terms,
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   and maybe we'll even give you a percent of revenue as a referral fee if you sell things.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.880]   We'd like to do for other things.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   I can imagine doing something where it actually makes the person more money
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   for using the Amazon one than it does for using the Google one,
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.880]   because they're happy to give you those 4% referral fees
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   and they give you when you sell something for them.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   Randall Schwartz is in our chat room in the host of our open source so floss weekly.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   If he had a great show today, if you haven't heard yet, he's in the chat room.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   He said, "You can't dump open source. That's the nature of open source."
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   Exactly. That's what open source is.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   It's like saying Apache, open source HTTP server to put IIS out of business.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   It's insane. It's open source.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   The whole idea is that it's open public and anyone can use it.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   It's not like...
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   Although there's some argument that the Android as positioned by Google
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   isn't exactly open source even.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   No, but the Android open source product is absolutely open source.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   It's true. They develop.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   The open handset alliance. That's the open source part.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   Right. The open handset alliance, exactly.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   I mean, the other thing Amazon could do if they wanted to really poke Google
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   would be to stick their fork, as it were, on GitHub,
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   say, we're accepting submissions from the outside to improve this,
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   and we'll do a merge from Google when they throw their code over the wall next time.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   You could quite happily do that, but the license that Android's under, they could do that.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   They could say, "Okay, we're actually going to do this."
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.880]   What is the Android list? Is it Apache?
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   It's a mixture because the bottom half is Linux, so that's GPL,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   but the middle piece is Apache, yeah.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.880]   Shall I play more? Is there more?
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   There are some other bits in there as well.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   Okay, let's keep going. Eric Schmidt continuing.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.880]   I think he announces the ship date of stuff.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.880]   I think that's the next thing he's going to say is it's --
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   Many, many coming. We have a new operating system,
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.880]   internally known as Ice Cream Sandwich, for some reason,
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   which is being released in October, November.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   Oh, don't play coy, Eric. We know exactly why you have a fetish for ice cream sandwiches.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   Okay.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   What he's very excited about, even more of these.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.880]   And I was thinking with this group that part of the reason that you'll want to continue this transition
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.880]   to cloud computing is that your internal customers are all using mobile devices,
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.880]   and they want all that power on their mobile device,
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   and they can't get it with the old system.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   They have to use the new cloud computing system,
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   which incentivize everybody to move to an HTML5.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.880]   So I stepped on it, but he's saying Ice Cream Sandwich will be out.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   I think he said October, yes. October, November. October, November.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   That's good. That's 2.4.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   Oh, it's the last track.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.880]   It's the actual real good tablet operating system.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   Okay, because 3.1 is the current tablet operating system, Honeycomb.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   Right.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.880]   Ice Cream Sandwich is the merge, isn't it?
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   Is it 4.0?
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.880]   No.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.880]   So it's 4.0.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.880]   So it's the...
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   I think of it at number yet.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   So we're going to leave Gingerbread here.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.880]   We're going to leave Honeycomb there, and we're going to merge them together to Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   Ice Cream Sandwich, yes.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   Okay.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   3.2.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.880]   So it is. We'll be up at 4.0.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.880]   4.0.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.880]   So I finally got Gingerbread on my Motorola Droid.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   So I'm not sure if that has anything to do with them buying them, but that actually appeared this week.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   So that was nice.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   Yeah, I actually used Cyan Agenda get to 235, and it really is nice.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880]   It's nice.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   This is one nasty side effect of the fragmentation that Google has not solved, which is getting all of these carriers and all of these manufacturers to get to the same version of the iOS.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   So they enacted that 18-month deal, right, where new phones have to be upgraded within 18 months of the release.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.880]   Yes, they said it at I/O. I don't know when that's...
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   Yeah, they're going to try and make that part of the conditions for the top-up thing.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   Good.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   And the other thing that they announced this week, or partially announced, was that they were making the browser on Android more part of the Chrome tree.
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.880]   It's WebKit right now.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.880]   It's WebKit, but they're bringing it there with, they're going to say, "Bringing Chromo."
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:55.880]   That means that it will actually go have an update cycle like Chrome does, rather than currently where we get a new browser every time we get a new OS release.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:10.880]   Chrome is continuously giving us a patch browser every six weeks, and you can choose which train you on and get a faster one, whereas at the moment, Android is just giving you a new browser every time there's a new OS update, which means it's lagging a bit on some features.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:20.880]   But that is also driven by carrier costs and so forth, because carriers won't push that kind of feature update without a charge back.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   Yeah, but if they just treat it as an app, which it is, then just deploy it through the app update mechanism they've already got.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   Then it's not a carrier. You're right, of course not.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.880]   Great point.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   Yeah, so if they can do that, then get their act together on that, that would be good, because the Android browser is now looking laggy compared, you know, an old, compared to...
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:46.880]   the iOS ones, especially the deployed iOS, because the iOS guys do tend to update their OS a bit more.
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   So the Android web browser is missing some bits that the iOS web browsers have now.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:57.880]   Pars for me, Kevin, the HTML5 references he made. Why is that important?
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   It's important again, because it's another standard that people can implement to, and the value of HTML5 is obviously that you can build stuff for that that works.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   Of course, multiple different devices.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   So is he implying that the app model is not the model going forward, that the web app model is the way to go?
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.880]   It's a... People have got bets on both horses. We're seeing a lot of hybrid apps now.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   What we're seeing is that people are using HTML5 for the stuff that it's good at, which is expanding, but particularly dynamic layouts, text layouts, updating of content, and then some of the rendering stuff that's there.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   And then using an app layer to do the bits that only the app can do.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   One of the great examples of that has been Netflix, where they have used HTML5 UI across their entire range of playback devices, but written custom playback code for the different video stuff that's available.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   So the UX for what you're choosing is the same across all of them.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   And they went so far as to port Netflix to the PS2, so they could do it on PS3, I think.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   So they could do it on that platform that didn't have a browser.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:12.880]   So that was that pattern that I'm seeing more of, and I'm seeing more stuff of the hybrid apps, both for tablets as well.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:26.880]   One of the announcements that the Salesforce thing was the touch.salesforce.com, which is an HTML5-based version designed for tablets and phones that works across Android and iOS stuff as well.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   And we started to see that pattern come up more and more.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   Dion Allen has been talking about this too, who's founder of Ajax, and has been talking about this as sort of the new pattern for app development for a while as well.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   This is exciting. So HTML5 sounds like the Holy Grail, the place where we all go and everything's going to happen.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   Have we been thinking that that day is almost here for about two years now?
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   Much like the second coming of Christ, HTML5 will be here any day now.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   It's going to solve everything. Everything I tell you. The second coming.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   Well, I think nobody knows better than Kevin Marks since you've been doing so much work in standards and video too, because one of the keys to getting HTML5 acceptance is solving this video issue.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.880]   What happens when you have bracket, video, bracket, and do you launch WebM?
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.880]   We haven't talked to you since the Motorola RUGLE deal.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.880]   Do you think the acquisition of those patents will help with WebM?
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.880]   Some people have worried about WebM's encumbrance.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   I don't know enough about Motorola's details of the matter of the patent pool.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.880]   They do have some video staff, but I'm not sure it'll help a lot with that.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:44.880]   That could be because the challenge there is there is an existing patent pool that's been fairly well organised by MPEG-LA.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   There's a potential challenge.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:54.880]   And MPEG-LA has said that they believe that Google's so-called open source WebM is in fact...
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   It's not so cool open source. The thing is not clear is whether there's actually a spec for it.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   The spec is mostly run this code at the moment.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   I shouldn't say so-called open source, I should say so-called unencumbered.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   Unpatent-encumbered.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.880]   That is a wizard debate.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.880]   And the patent stuff is a mess.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   Everyone's agreeing that now, and the challenges can we actually fix this?
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   Should these companies be spending billions of dollars on patents?
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:32.880]   One piece that I think is, for me, software patents are basically breaking the basic idea of what patents are for.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.880]   If you read the statute of ad in the UK, or if you read the American Constitution,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   the point of the patent is to promote the science and useful art,
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   is to make somebody tell you how they did something so that in future you can do it too.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   Now, we have another solution that is called open source.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   It's actually better and much better at getting people to do things.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.880]   And the one for me that...
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   Just a couple of weeks ago, Apple did a patent on printing without a driver,
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   and Google has Google Cloud Print, which is an open source project that does printing without a driver.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   And if you actually look at them side by side, one of them is, here's some code.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   Download this code, build it. You can now print without a driver.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   The other one is, we propose a method for extracting it,
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   and it's like the most opaque, specious, clear-speed.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   But what does better in court the specific code or the specious lawyer speak?
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   My partner would be, "Okay, you can have software patents, but you have to produce code that runs."
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   That's what I think.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   And if it's agreed in a repository, so at the end we want something there.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   And then post that compared to the open source.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.880]   It has to be an actual working method.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   Just as in the original days of patent, you had to build a model.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   Yes. So you had to have something that worked.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.880]   The patent, these sort of long hand-wavey descriptions that have been written to be as general,
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.880]   I don't know, opaque as possible, shouldn't be allowed.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.880]   And yeah, maybe you should be able to patent code, but code.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.880]   Not that actually has to run.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   And it is a specific mechanism rather than a hand-wavey description of an algorithm.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.880]   Schmidt did actually address this.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   He said that we bought Mo Mo to roll up for more than just patents.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.880]   It wasn't just a patent purchase.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   He's saying it's a product purchase.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.880]   Yeah, he says they're going to--
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.880]   He's excited about the product.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   Yes.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   They're going to spin it off.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.880]   Yeah, I mean, what we were kind of hoping for is like, "Oh, you know, they're going to make great handsets here."
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   But the story in the tech media sphere was that it was about the patents.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   But he sounds like he's trying to steer the other way now.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   That's great.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   Actually, not spin it off.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   If they're going to make it an independent, you know, autonomous venture that will continue to make great phones, I think that's fantastic.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   Part of that is the stock market's reaction to this merger, which is that Motorola will be a drag on Google, so they're going to actually manage Google.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   I mean, it's going to manage the Motorola.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   Well, that's a real challenge.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   It's an interesting challenge.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   And I think Google has some of the same challenges Yahoo has, and it's actually fun to watch them.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   At least so far handle it better.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:05.880]   Well, and one of the stories on the list is they work there killing products, and they're focusing, which we've said for some time they need to.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.880]   And, you know, Larry is doing that.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.880]   It looks like.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   Ten products gone.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   Ding dong side wiki is dead.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880]   I never did like that.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   I never did like that.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   Right.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   We did.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   We hated it.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   We hated it.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   But not at all.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   Not at all, oddly enough.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   Let's see.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   I'm looking for the list here.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   Desktop, that's one thing we might.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.880]   That made me sad.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.880]   What is desktop?
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.880]   Google desktop is an installable application.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.880]   I believe it's Windows only and maybe Mac.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   But it basically indexes the local files on your hard drive.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   Desktop search got it.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880]   Desktop search, right.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.880]   So you search and it combines desktop files.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.880]   I guess once everything you have is in the cloud, you won't need it.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.880]   You don't need it.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.880]   Art Vark.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.880]   The decision.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.880]   Art Vark is dead.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.880]   Google Web Security is dead.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.880]   Fast flip.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.880]   I like that.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.880]   It's dead.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   But in Marissa.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   Did you use it?
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.880]   Leo?
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.880]   No, but I like it.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.880]   I didn't use any of these.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.880]   The Google Image Labeller.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   Google Notebook.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   Side wiki, yay.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880]   Subscribed links.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.880]   I like Side wiki.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   I think there was something that they missed which was that they were actually collating the same people commenting on the same thing across the web.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   So one of the things that Side wiki did was if you commented it on a block of text and it found that block of text on another page, it propagated your comment.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   Which was really nice.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.880]   But that it was opaque enough that people didn't actually use it very much.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:39.880]   And they didn't spend the time of saying, "Oh, we can crawl the existing people where people quote text and throw that into this mix as well."
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.880]   So it's another one of those things that had a lot of potential but never quite fulfilled it.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.880]   It's redundant because of Google+.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.880]   I mean, the Google+ doesn't do that thing that you just described, but people are commenting on links on Google+ all the time now.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   It just seems to have both.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   It's different, but Google+ is much more easily to understand, I think.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   Yeah, no, I think the things that I like about Google+ stuff is when they actually take advantage of the fact that they're crawling the entire web all the time.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   And use it to do something nicer.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   And that was something that Side wiki did that wasn't in the plus doesn't do.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   This is my Side wiki.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.880]   I wrote a Side wiki.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   And I know when Side wiki was launched because I wrote it that day, 23rd September, 2009.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   And it hasn't done anything since.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   No, no, no, I can see why they killed it off, but it's kind of sad that they missed something there.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   They also killed Photovine, which is... Photovine's what, 10 days old when they killed it.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   Talking about infant mortality.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.880]   They killed all of the slide stuff.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   They killed... I mean, this is good. This is what you wanted. Earlier this year, they killed the Power Meter Services.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.880]   Google Health, which you put a lot of energy behind.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.880]   I think, you know, when they killed Wave, it was like such a shock because it's... Oh, it's so much energy behind it.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   And blah, blah, blah. And you're so willing to kill this. And now they're showing, no, no, if something doesn't go...
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.880]   They're pairing down. It's a good thing.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   I'm just glad that Picasso didn't get...
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   That ain't going anywhere because that's so tied into Google+, right?
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   That's Google+'s photoshare.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.880]   Oh, yeah, Picasso Web. But I meant the desktop.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.880]   Like, I heard that they killed the Google desktop because everyone just keeps everything in the cloud now.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.880]   I got nervous for Picasso, the desktop version of Picasso because it's a really good photo manager.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.880]   It's what I used to manage, you know, all my digital photos from 1998 on, so I got a little nervous about that.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.880]   I mean, we're going to be storing some stuff on our hard drive.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:39.880]   I'm not going to upload the terabyte of personal digital photos I've taken since 1998 to the cloud.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.880]   I mean, I'm not there yet.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:48.880]   But also, Picasso Web is the cloud aspect of that. You need some client, and I think that it works so well with on Android, you know, and on Google+.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.880]   And then you should need a desktop client. I think this is... I think if anything, that its fate is protected by the success of Google+.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.880]   That's good.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.880]   I hope so. I'm glad to see that.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.880]   What else should Google kill right now?
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.880]   No.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.880]   No.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.880]   Yeah, that's no reason to keep... No.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:11.880]   I know this Paine's Kevin Marks because he was big on the... You helped do Google profiles, right?
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.880]   Which went through null, didn't it?
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   Well, the pain for me is what they're doing with profiles on Plus, which is making them less general.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.880]   Right.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.880]   You know, I don't want to rehearse the whole anonymity thing again.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:32.880]   But they've said, "Okay, we want these provres to be across all Google products," which was the original point of doing them as well.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:40.880]   But they've now said, "Oh, wait a minute. They have to follow these weird rules about naming and things that work for Plus, but don't necessarily work for all the other Google products as well."
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   So they're actually undermining the value of them in my book.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.880]   I've heard the top question for Kevin, Orchid.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.880]   Kill Orchid?
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.880]   No, I would kill Orchid. It's very successful for the people to use it.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.880]   There's ill, I was...
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.880]   It's still got... You know...
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.880]   I don't know how many users...
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   But in the tens of millions, if not a hundred million users, it's a decent-sized social network that people get value from it.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   And I'm sure they can be made to generate traffic in the same way that you can use Plus for that.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   What I suspect is they may bring more of the Plus features into it and most of it in there.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   But it wouldn't...
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:26.880]   If the user base in the countries where Orchid is popular will be really, will be a really nasty thing to do to them.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   No kidding.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   Unless you had an alternative that you could migrate them to.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.880]   How about Buzz? Why don't they kill Buzz?
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Why don't they just come on? Just delete Buzz.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   Good point.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.880]   Yes, delete it.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.880]   And now they all have the nasty email from people who love Buzz to...
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.880]   No! No! No one that was true six months ago.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.880]   That was a good question.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.880]   There's no one there.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.880]   There were ten people there who, if you said anything bad about Buzz, they'd flame you.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.880]   They were going to invade our chat room, but no one noticed.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   And that...
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   And that, but though the good news is...
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   No, no, it's one guy.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.880]   Because everybody's moved to Plus.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.880]   So, I'm not even...
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   Okay, but that's a good point.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:09.880]   I wouldn't use Prize if there's announcements that they're going to roll Buzz in a Plus or somehow data liberation Buzz and shut it down soon.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   Data liberation, by the way, some controversy over that.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.880]   They're really getting liberated by Buzz.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.880]   That's part of the thing you can download.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   We take it out.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.880]   Right.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   But I suspect...
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.880]   Oh yeah, I can download what we take out now.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   What they may do is migrate it into Plus.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.880]   When they say, "Okay, Plus is a real thing," and we migrate all the Buzz stuff into it.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   Because it's close enough.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   Right.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   Bass skipper says you didn't like...
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.880]   I'm on the Landerson.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   Go ahead.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.880]   Just Tom Anderson and Trey Radcliffe, I think became friends on Google Plus.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.880]   They did.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.880]   They went on the last minute.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   Now they're lovers.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.880]   With...
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.880]   Yes.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   They...
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   They just...
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   They...
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.880]   Tom apparently, Trey's moved into one of Tom's old houses.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.880]   And then they all went to Burning Man together.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:49.880]   That is a bromance.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.880]   A Google plus...
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   And Trey was teaching Tom how to take pictures.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.880]   Oh yeah, it's just...
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   It's amazing.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880]   It's kind of...
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.880]   You know, a little PDA going on there, I think.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   [laughter]
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   A social network isn't real.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   So there's a bromance that happens.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   And I love Trey, by the way.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   And I'm just teasing him.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   But actually, we try to get Tom Anderson for an interview.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   And he says, "We don't do..."
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.880]   He's not doing interviews.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.880]   You don't do them now.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.880]   No.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.880]   He's just kind of learning to be public again, which is an amazing thing.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   Well, Tom, people read Google plus, so...
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.880]   Just saying.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   Let's take a break.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   I just love doing this show.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.880]   We've got such a good panel.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   Of course, Kevin Marks, Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   We will talk about more stuff in a moment.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   But you were talking about Netflix, and I wanted to just say
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   I have the Netflix Chrome plug-in installed.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.880]   And it looks exactly like the Netflix web page.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.880]   I'm not sure what the difference is, you know?
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:52.880]   I mean, but yes, this is the Chrome extension for Netflix.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.880]   Netflix streaming, of course, the page to look at, because this is where the action is, baby.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.880]   I was talking to somebody the other day, and I said, "Watch Spike Lee's do the right thing."
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   At the beginning there.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.880]   And of course, he could, because he's on Netflix streaming.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   $7.99 a month.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.880]   And the British office, we've been watching that.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880]   That's fun.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.880]   My daughter's going right back through all the old office episodes.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.880]   Oh, the Marx Brothers.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   What is this?
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   Duck soup.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   Awesome.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   I know what I'm watching tonight.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   They've got classics.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.880]   They've got new movies.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.880]   If you're mad as hell and you're not going to take it anymore, they've got network.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.880]   Great movie.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.880]   Great movie.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   My cousin Vinny.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   My cousin Vinny.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.880]   I saw that.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:36.880]   I just scrolled by.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   Oh, Marissa Tomei is so good in it.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.880]   And Joe Pesci.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.880]   The Yutes.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.880]   The Yutes.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.880]   Let's not, I mean, I just saw some video drone.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:46.880]   There's a classic.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.880]   Wow.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.880]   I haven't seen that in years.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.880]   I just, I scrolled by something.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.880]   Oh, the Pixar story.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880]   A document.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   They're good on documentaries.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   That's a great documentary.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.880]   Ed Catmull, the guy who started Pixar.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.880]   It starts at the beginning there.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.880]   And it's directed by Leslie Iwerks.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.880]   I presume that's Oob Iwerks is son or daughter.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.880]   This is just such a great resource.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   You could spend all day just browsing.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   But then the beauty is pick a movie and watch it.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   On your Mac, your PC.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.880]   Modern TVs, most Blu-ray players.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.880]   And also have Netflix built in.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.880]   Your PS3, your Xbox 360.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.880]   You see this is their HTML5 strategy.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.880]   It's working there everywhere.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   The Lion and Winter.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.880]   What a great movie.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.880]   Patrick Stewart.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.880]   Oh, this is a remake.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.880]   Interesting of the course, this classic.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.880]   Who's the co-star?
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.880]   It's Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:50.880]   But originally it was Katherine Hepburn and Peter--
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.880]   What's his name?
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.880]   You know, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   That other guy.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   Anyway.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.880]   I forgot his performance.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.880]   Yes.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.880]   Or his name.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.880]   Nintendo Wii.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.880]   Basically, this is the way you bring movies to your iPad,
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.880]   your iPhone, your Android phone.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.880]   Your Android phone.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:13.880]   So here's how you do it.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.880]   You go to Netflix.com/twit.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.880]   And you got a month free.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.880]   If you've already got it, don't worry about it.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.880]   Just tell a friend.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:20.880]   Throw up the window.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   Run to the window.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   Open it up.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880]   Shout out the window.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:28.880]   I love Netflix and I want you to take it free.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.880]   Thirty days free.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.880]   I've been starting to go back through the old man, man.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:32.880]   That's funny.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.880]   Getting ready for the next season.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.880]   Netflix.com/twit free for 30.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.880]   Tell your friends.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.880]   It is such a good deal.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.880]   This week in Google.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.880]   Peter O'Toole.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   Thank you.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   Peter O'Toole.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   Oh, the Netflix is on my droid now.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   It wasn't before.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   Excellent.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.880]   Yes.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.880]   They've been...
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.880]   That's so far up there.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.880]   I did droid.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880]   They've been getting more and more droids.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.880]   By the way, hot droid out right now.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.880]   Droid bionic.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:00.880]   Everybody's getting excited.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   It comes out tomorrow on Verizon.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.880]   Four and a half inch screen.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.880]   Very fast.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.880]   Everybody's excited.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.880]   Except now I'm thinking, do I buy that?
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.880]   Or sprints going to have the Galaxy 2S in about two weeks?
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.880]   You think that one?
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.880]   I think you wait for either the droid prime or the next...
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   Are you wait for the next phone that has ice cream sandwich?
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   Everybody loves a bionic.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.880]   What is it though?
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   It's for you.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   I guess because you can afford it.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   You just spent a million dollars on this...
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   I can't afford nothing.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   I can't afford nothing.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   Then I say wait from my phone.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   This is the same shirt I had 11 years ago in a screen saver.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   I can't afford nothing.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.880]   I have the same mug you're using everything.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.880]   Same mug.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.880]   This is a zdtv, the gimme stuff.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.880]   Sprint is suing now.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.880]   They're getting involved in the AT&T mobile merger.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   Remember the DOJ is trying to block it.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   Sprint is also trying to block it.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.880]   Of course they are.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.880]   They would be probably the people most affected by this.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   Wouldn't Sprint want to be bought by somebody and so...
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.880]   Careful what you say today because you might regret it tomorrow?
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.880]   You think AT&T would buy Sprint?
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.880]   No.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.880]   I want Google to buy Sprint.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.880]   Don't you want Google to have a phone company?
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   No?
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   Sure.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   But here's the problem.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   I wouldn't have been shipped wide spaces.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.880]   Yeah, wide spaces is the key, right?
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   No.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   That's what we believe.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.880]   A million phone companies.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   Here's an interesting talk.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.880]   I was talking about patents.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.880]   A couple of good stories both from fosspatent.com.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   Apple, I love this because this guy is just obsessively reading these filings.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:41.880]   Since no one else can understand them, it's good you got somebody who understands them reading the filings.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.880]   According to Apple in their complaint against HTC, they went to the International Trade Commission.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   And in that briefing it says Andy Rubin, I didn't know this, when he was working...
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   Andy Rubin, of course the guy in charge of Android.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   When he was working at Apple in the early 1990s, worked as a low-level engineer reporting to the inventors of the...
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:08.880]   It says tick 263.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   I think it's...
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   Are they talking about H.263?
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   No, no.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.880]   It's just that they refer to the last three digits of the patent name.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   It's a patent.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   Okay.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.880]   The real-time API patent got it.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:19.880]   It's a patent.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.880]   It's a patent.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.880]   It's an open door for something.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.880]   It's something like...
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.880]   It worked for them when the invention was being conceived and developed.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.880]   So this...
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   And apparently it's...
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   This patent is one of the issues in this HTC infringement, one of the two patents.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.880]   This is...
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.880]   I mean, but this is such bullshit.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.880]   Have they not read the history of Silicon Valley?
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.880]   This place was actually built by people leaving companies and starting new companies all the time.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:48.880]   It all started out with Fairchild and then the guys left and built Intel and the guys left and built everything else.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   And the entire place was built by engineers leaving because they couldn't get on with their bosses and working on technology.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   It was similar.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   And if you're gonna say, "Oh, 20 years ago, Andy Roome was sitting in the same room as these guys who found a way to embed objects in objects,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:04.880]   and therefore, androids should be destroyed," you are literally insane.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   I love it.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   It's total ball.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   You flattened it.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   Forget it.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.880]   I'm sorry I even brought it up at this point.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.880]   No, I love it.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.880]   Thank you.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   That's what...
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.880]   That was the...
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.880]   ...flaming denial I was looking for.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.880]   That is fantastic.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   Fos Patton's also just had an article.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.880]   For Shocker.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.880]   Shocker.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.880]   It says, "For Android OEM."
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   So, he's now parsing the Oracle Google thing, including a senior Google engineers admission that he...
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.880]   Well, maybe I put a little suncoat into Android.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:47.880]   Maybe I...
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.880]   What do you say to this?
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.880]   What do you say to this, Mr. Marks?
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.880]   Here is a job...
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   You just do it.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.880]   I was trying to read the 263-Patton to see if it actually makes any sense at all, which is probably a...
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.880]   It's probably a very vague...
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.880]   A waste of my life.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.880]   Yeah, don't.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:01.880]   Stop.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:11.880]   We're moved on now to this exactly identical code in Android and Oracle's Java, or Sun's Java originally.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.880]   Oh, you got at least changed the variable names.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   They didn't change anything, including array index out of bounds exception.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.880]   Of course, that's a logical name.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:20.880]   But this...
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.880]   I mean, even the tab...
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.880]   The whole term of error was like that.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.880]   This is a cut and paste, because even the tabbing is identical, right?
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   Well...
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.880]   Maybe that was auto.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.880]   Maybe that was a game code-sciled guy.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.880]   Pretty print.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:32.880]   Pretty print.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   It's pretty printed.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   It could be pretty printed, yeah.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   It's pretty close, though, isn't it?
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.880]   What do you think?
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.880]   It looks pretty much the same.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.880]   Let me go back to the article.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:48.880]   I mean, I think the reality is that everybody uses skills and to some extent material from
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   one job and their own job.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.880]   Is that the same thing?
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   Is that the same thing?
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:52.880]   It's just...
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.880]   It's not quite the same.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.880]   I mean...
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   Copy...
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.880]   Copy and code is going a little far.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.880]   Yeah, copy and code is going a little far, but...
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.880]   This one is going to be doing anything amazing, is it?
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.880]   No, it's kind of obvious.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.880]   Range checking code, right?
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.880]   Yeah, is that block of code?
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.880]   I can't seem to find a link to that block of code.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.880]   Is that block of code the entirety of everything that was copied in...
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   I mean, how many lines?
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   Certainly.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:17.880]   If that's all that is, it's like eight lines.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.880]   If that's all that is, it's not much.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   That's...
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   Um...
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   This is...
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:22.880]   Uh...
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   Then this is the...
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   This is the other one.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:35.880]   The shocker for Android OEM's Google document proposes giving Motorola time to market advantage to build Android lead devices.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   So this is what you wanted, Gina.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   It's all your fault.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   This is what they've done already.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.880]   (LAUGHTER)
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   You know, that's when they first tried.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   That's exactly what they did.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.880]   When they built the first G1, that's exactly what they did.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   Right.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   They've done this.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:56.880]   We will work with one developer on the example of our phone for this release for the last, you know, three or four years.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.880]   Maybe they've been doing it.
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.880]   So it's not anything necessarily new.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.880]   You know, it may make more sense for them to actually iterate with more than one developer now.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.880]   If I was there, I might be looking at that.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.880]   But this isn't a change of practice.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:12.880]   And, you know, as people have said, you know, they have somewhat within their rights to do this.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   I think it would be...
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.880]   I guess that's the question.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.880]   It would be...
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880]   And why is it just favor-majorilla?
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.880]   That would be silly because the other guys are building great devices.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   You need them, yeah.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   So this is the smoking slide.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.880]   Nowadays, it's not a smoking gun.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.880]   It's a smoking powerpoint slide.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   Or maybe this is Google Docs.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:36.880]   And by the way, notice that the bottom provide incentives, carrots, rather than sticks, straight out of the Eric Schmidt playbook here.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   If we give it away, how can we ensure we get benefit from it?
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.880]   Do not develop and open, instead make source code available after innovation is complete.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.880]   Think Google's doing that.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.880]   Lead device concept.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.880]   Give early access to the software to partners who build and distribute devices to our specification.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   They get a non-contractual time to market advantage.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   And in return, they align to our standard.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:07.880]   These are two ways to encourage exactly what Eric was talking about, encourage companies to keep pure Android out there.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.880]   Is it illegal? I don't even know if it's illegal.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   No, it's not illegal at all.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.880]   I mean, it's exactly what people do with a closed source codebase already.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.880]   Although it could piss off other partners.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.880]   But it could piss off the partners if they're too stupid about it.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   Right.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.880]   As I said, they've done this up to now with some of these releases.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.880]   I'm not sure they've done it with more recent ones.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.880]   This is when they were doing the fast iterations.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   They were explicitly saying, "Okay, we're going to do a sprint with this manufacturer to make sure this thing works."
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.880]   So we've got a device that we can actually iterate on and iterate the firmware in other pieces as well.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   And then end up with something that we can show it off at the end of it.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:51.880]   And they did ones like the Nexus 1, which was one of these,
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.880]   which was done with the HTC.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880]   Right.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.880]   So I'm not sure it's any different than what they've been doing,
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.880]   but they'd be sensible to do it with more than my manufacturer over time.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:15.880]   Now, Florian, in his Befas patents blog, maybe takes a step too far by saying that this proves what we've previously suspected that the Android source code tree has private branches.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   I don't think that that necessarily is the case.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.880]   Or is it?
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.880]   Well, the private branch is the one that they're working on from the last release up until today.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.880]   Well, until they open source.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.880]   It's private.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.880]   Yes.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   Of course.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.880]   But that's not -- you don't need proof for that.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   They say it.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.880]   It's clear.
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   That is clear.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   No, no, they just match the right -- all the code in one day.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880]   All right.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.880]   We'll think about it really hard for months, and then that last day, we'll just type it all out.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   If they wrote it in wave, you could see them type it as they get it.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   That's the way to do it.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.880]   But that's the sort of -- the whole notion of branches is changing anyway.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.880]   The way you write code these days is moving towards the Git model where everybody has a branch.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880]   Right?
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.880]   Everybody's walking all the time and they're merging back.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.880]   So I think that you can defend that.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   The difficulty is that the objections to their behaving is that they are just doing these monolithic releases
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   and they're not taking patches from anyone else, as far as we know.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.880]   Unless they're doing that privately with some of these companies.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.880]   But they don't seem to be sitting there saying, "Oh, yeah, if someone has done some bugs there,
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.880]   we should measure the most of that back into the tree."
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.880]   Oh, they haven't done that at all yet.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.880]   That's interesting.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.880]   I thought that I've seen.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.880]   Have you seen a record of that?
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:35.880]   I honestly haven't looked through the open source repository, but I just kind of -- I just assume that bug fixes
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.880]   were getting -- or patches were getting back into the tree.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.880]   They would be a huge shame if they weren't.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.880]   I mean, that's kind of the whole point of open sourcing to begin with.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.880]   I mean, this part about some OEMs not being as equal as others.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:52.880]   I mean, this is Google just giving incentives to release phones to their specifications,
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   which I think should be even tighter than they are.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.880]   Yeah, because we all want those vanilla phones, yeah.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.880]   Right.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.880]   Right.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   So we talked about the Amazon tablet, which is really the one to watch coming probably the next few months,
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.880]   but there are other new Android tablets at IFA in Berlin this week.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:19.880]   Samsung announced the Galaxy Tab 7.7, which Apple properly forced them to pull from the table.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.880]   Duacore 1.4 GHz processor and HSPA support.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:34.880]   HTC released a 4G tablet called the Jetstream that is 10 plus inches, I think.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.880]   Toshiba announced a 10.1 inch honeycomb that's a little thinner than the Thrive,
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.880]   actually thinner even than the Galaxy 7.7.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.880]   And then the Lenovo, which will be only $199, the idea pad, A1.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.880]   One hundred and nine dollars.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.880]   I think that's that one.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880]   Seven inch.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:01.880]   You know, the... if MG Seagler's right, and I have every reason to believe he is $250 for the Amazon
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:07.880]   and you get free Amazon Prime, which is worth $80, that's really the price leader.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   If you're somebody who buy Amazon Prime, that's basically $170 tablet.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880]   Well, I still love about that.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.880]   We mentioned this on Twitter, but I still love about that.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:21.880]   It's so smart of Amazon because it also reduces the cost of Amazon shipping because the more people buy digitally,
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.880]   the less they have to ship.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:30.880]   So they're using Prime to give a value, and in doing that, they're reducing the cost structure of Prime.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.880]   You could put it in the 7.11 and pick it up.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.880]   That's a good source.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.880]   So bizarre.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.880]   This is crazy.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.880]   Do you see those lockers?
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.880]   They look so strange and small.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.880]   This is a trial in Seattle.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:47.880]   The idea being, I guess if you're in a big city, you don't have Amazon deliver stuff because it just sits on your doorstep
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.880]   where it gets stolen right away.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   I don't know, because I love it.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   I come to work every day.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.880]   I've got Amazon packages waiting for me.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.880]   Somebody sent me suspenders today.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   October Fests.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.880]   Is there a, I don't know, October Fests well enough.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.880]   Maybe our German chatters will tell me.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.880]   Is there a style of suspenders for October Fests?
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.880]   Because these are the goofiest looking suspenders.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880]   Is that true?
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.880]   Later has enough.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   Do they send you later has into?
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   No, there's no later has just suspenders.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   Maybe the later has an intercoming in a separate box.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.880]   It probably has a thing, you know, here, right?
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   Yeah, but the team had a hunch to vote.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880]   Definitely.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   That way.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   What is it?
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.880]   Proset.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   Proset.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880]   All right, I don't know.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   You know what?
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   Let's do an October Fests twig, Jeff.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   We should.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   We should.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   We should.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880]   We'll put a big mug in front of you.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   I'll bring beer.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.880]   I'll bring beer.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   Yeah, I'm down for beer.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880]   All right.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.880]   Anyway, this is, this is, so that if you don't want Amazon to leave something on your step,
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   they can leave it at the local 711 where you can check in and it'll pop it out.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   I love that the lockers have different sizes with different size boxes.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   And I take it, you probably go up to that terminal type in whenever it is, the end of the
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   door, whatever it is, the, and then it, it opens, it goes, whoosh.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.880]   Oh, I would have to.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.880]   You're putting numbers on your Amazon.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.880]   Shh.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   And I hope steam comes out when it opens up.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.880]   I do.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   And an Android powered robot arm will present you with your package.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   All right.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.880]   A couple more stories and we're going to wrap it up.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:25.520]   I do have to mention G drive because according to MG Seagler, once again, Google may be
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.520]   on the verge of resurrecting it.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.520]   Yeah, and this had to do with an issue filed in the Chromium or Chrome bug tracker.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.520]   Must have been the Chromium bug tracker because it was, because it was public.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:41.520]   But someone had filed an issue and said, "Hey, you should add drive.google.com to the,
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.520]   I'm paraphrasing here, whitelisted list of URLs."
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.520]   And then, and then someone else at Google responded, "Look screeno, took the patch, looks
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.520]   great to me and committed it."
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.520]   And so everyone was going, "What's drive.google.com?"
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.520]   Which is not available to anyone right now.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.520]   And so now it's just this rumor that G drive will be resurrected.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.520]   Well, it could be something else that's designed for in-car use.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.520]   Right.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:10.520]   They've already got that sort of fairly lame Android app that is supposed to be your dashboard
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520]   control thing.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   I imagine they could be doing something like that.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.520]   I'm at least surprised if they're bringing G drive back.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.520]   This is what I love.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520]   This is a new form of investigative journalism.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.520]   They read the code journalism.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520]   Well, this is right.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.520]   This is why Android's developed in private or the newest version of Android.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.520]   You can't have civilians looking through the issue tracker.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.520]   Look at this variable.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.520]   This proves without a doubt.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.520]   There's a guy.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520]   What's his name?
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.520]   Florian Rawr or something who did this with Google Plus.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.520]   He was parsing all the JavaScript code and coming up with features.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.520]   And Google hired him.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520]   Oh, did they?
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520]   He did.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.520]   That's smart.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.520]   I think it's awesome.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.520]   Like, James is launching.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.520]   This movie is going to be serious.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520]   Exactly.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.520]   Yeah, with the Android market as well.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.520]   That looks like movies are coming soon.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.520]   I love that.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.520]   Is there a problem with Google Places?
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.520]   New York Times says it's too easy to close a store and not easy enough to reopen it.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.520]   And the number of stores have been closed on Google Places because malicious people will
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.520]   come along and say, no, no, that place is closed.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.520]   But it can't just be one person that does it.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520]   He has to be a number of people.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   Well, it's all closed.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.520]   Google's HQ.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.520]   And it took two of them.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   That's beautifully.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520]   It only took two of them to close Google.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.520]   Okay, well, there you go.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520]   Wait, somebody closed Google HQ?
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   Seriously?
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   Yes.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   Yes.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   Just to make the points.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   Nice.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520]   That does make the point.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:37.520]   The drum beat is like, you know, need more humans making decisions versus algorithms.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.520]   Python is not good.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.520]   Or you need to make the algorithm better, depending on who you are.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   How do you hear that?
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520]   Something Python can't do.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   Right.py.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.520]   That.py file doesn't help.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]   I'm going to Google.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520]   It's just the first.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   We're talking about Tuesday.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:57.440]   According to Search Engine Land, actually, according to Google, Google's already figured
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.120]   it out, but it was published on Search Engine Land.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.880]   44% of searches for last minute holiday gifts this year.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   I don't know how this is another Python script will be on Android or mobile anyway.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.480]   They're expecting the total volume of all searches in the US for holiday gifts last
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.680]   minute will be on smart files.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680]   That makes sense.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   Makes total sounds.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.680]   That's when I'm shopping.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.080]   You know, Christmas Eve, I'm not going to have my laptop.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.360]   Well, you're also in the store.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.360]   You're checking out the price.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360]   It's price transparency.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.960]   This is another kick to the kidneys of local retail.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.640]   I'm reading a wonderful book right now.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   Just picked up last week.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   I remember the name of it now.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.880]   I'm reading my tablet out.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   I just wanted to know that I've, you know, drunk the Kool-Aid here.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   Which tablet is it?
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880]   It's smart.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   It's smart.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880]   It's smart.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880]   Oh, sorry.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.840]   You're a little late on the Kool-Aid.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   We've almost taken it.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   I know I am.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.840]   I am.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.840]   It's a little stale.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.760]   The great A&P and the struggle for small business in America is a review of the times
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:07.000]   like, but it's wonderful that how the A&P was kind of the internet and Walmart to mom
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.360]   and pop groceries across the country in the time and came up with all these new mechanisms
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:18.520]   of marketing and brands and gross purchases and all that and lowered prices.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.840]   And it's just fascinating to see these waves of disruption.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.320]   What goes around Kettle?
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.320]   La Piusa-Shahls.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.400]   So, you know, what's going to happen next with using your phone to check on prices is
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   there's no price opacity anymore.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.720]   You can't take advantage of it.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.720]   It's gone.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.720]   It's good.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.200]   You basically have to guarantee that you'll match the lowest price.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.000]   So, you have to tell your customers if you scan the barcode or if you check online,
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.280]   you get a lower price, we'll match it.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.280]   I mean, you know, to get the person to buy.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.880]   I think a lot of that though, when that used to happen was because nobody could figure
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.960]   out what the lower price was.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.280]   So, they didn't really expect that you would call them on it.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.360]   Now you're going to call them on it.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.360]   Yeah, you're going to call them on it.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.400]   Maybe you won't see more of that.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.120]   You know, but at some point it's not even worth the effort to show them the lower prices.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   You got to charge it.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.120]   You got to charge it on Amazon.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   That's right.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.120]   But it was, yeah, especially in California, the sales tax is 9% as and has an edge there.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   That's part of the...
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.840]   No, they don't and that's another problem.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.840]   It just...
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.840]   That's one of the things that's going on.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840]   They're trying to...
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.640]   The state is saying you should actually collect the sales tax.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.640]   That's right.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.800]   In that context, it's defensible.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.840]   You know, somebody put it this way was that when the internet was new, we had this favorable
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.760]   tax treatment to help it not be choked.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.480]   But now it's the other way around.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.840]   The retailers are the ones who need some help because having physical stores in your
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.640]   location is actually a useful thing.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.040]   You know, that's part of the problem is that you're right, Kevin, is for there to be
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.720]   an uneven play and feel that's true.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:40.080]   But one thing in the same P-Book is that the court's favor legacy, just to favor legacy,
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.720]   is part of where Eric Schmidt argues, is all of our resources and regulation go to favor
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.720]   the legacy, not the newcomer.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.160]   But as I said, this was one example where they didn't.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   Which was the other way around?
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.760]   I suppose it was the mail order example that had come before, right?
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.920]   There was a deliberate effort to favor mail order early on in the same way that there
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:07.640]   was effort in the constitution or shortly afterwards to favor sending newspapers through the mail.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.600]   There was some presumption that this would help unite the country if they were able to
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600]   do that.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.080]   I have to say, though, by the way, the New York Times yesterday in the editorial said that
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.880]   the Amazon's no holds barred fight to avoid collecting sales taxes is an abdication of
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.760]   corporate responsibility.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.760]   They slapped them around.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.160]   But I have to say, it's not completely clear, for instance, we pay, as state law requires,
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.360]   use tax on our Amazon purchases here.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.960]   It's in your yearly income tax for the state.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.440]   It says, "Well, did you buy anything online?
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.440]   Pay us."
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.200]   Really, the issue is only whether the retailer collects, not whether you owe it.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.040]   You owe it.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.040]   We pay it.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.000]   We paid, I think, $6,000 last year in use tax.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.320]   But I should point out that we, as affiliates, I made...
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.880]   Well, I have to be honest.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.240]   You are very honest, Leo.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.320]   But this is why it's complicated.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.120]   The state got that use tax out of me.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.360]   Because I am an affiliate and made about $30,000 last year in Amazon affiliate sales and paid
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.920]   taxes on that to the tune of about $10,000.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:18.880]   Actually, the state only got maybe $6,000 of that.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.520]   What they're going to lose now is they're going to lose that use tax.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.920]   They're going to lose that income tax because I'm no longer collecting affiliate fees.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.080]   What they're going to gain is whatever Amazon collects, which, as I note here, will not be
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.000]   until next year, it's actually going to be a net loss for the state of California for
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   a second.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.680]   Well, Amazon though, just as trying to bribe California, they said that they would move,
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:43.960]   I think it's something like 7,000 jobs to California if California delayed the collection
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.960]   of the sell tax.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.520]   The state says it will generate $200 million in additional taxes.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.800]   The question is, is it really about making more money for the state of California or about
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.000]   fairness for brick and mortar retailers?
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   I agree with you, Kevin.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.880]   If it comes down to fairness for brick and mortar, I think it's time perhaps to say,
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.680]   "Yeah, let's make it a level plate."
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.480]   Let me play the other end of it.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.760]   At some point, who says that retail is local?
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.400]   Who says the state should have any call on what we buy?
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.000]   The whole notion of saying that you get to tax what's bought down at the corner, that
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.480]   there's no such thing as a corner store anymore.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.320]   So why does the city have a VAT like Europe does?
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   National one.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   Exactly.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.880]   And then of course, the other argument is this is a highly regressive tax, which hits
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.200]   poor people harder than it hits wealthy people.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.080]   And so maybe it isn't, maybe the state should get out of the sales tax or the value out
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.600]   of tax business entirely.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600]   It's very complicated.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.600]   I don't think it's immediately...
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:44.080]   It was more than poor, but that's not particularly clear that one because the sales tax has exemptions
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.080]   for food and...
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.080]   Right.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.560]   It's supposed to be kind of a luxury tax, isn't it?
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.880]   Yeah, but I mean, if you call gas luxury, then you're probably not really paying too much
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   attention.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.120]   I think it's a great conversation.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.120]   That's a cowboy.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.040]   Is that a Californian talking?
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   We need our gas.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.080]   It ain't no luxury.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.400]   My God, it's three miles to work.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.200]   And there's no last transit.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.800]   You see the tax on gas in Europe?
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.800]   I know.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.280]   We have no right to complain.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.680]   A couple of quick stories.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:15.680]   Reddit.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.600]   Reddit is basically...
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.280]   Which was purchased by Conde Nast.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.800]   They said there was a culture clash.
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.800]   And yay!
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.400]   Reddit's going to be basically still owned by Conde Nast, but they're spinning it out
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.720]   as a separate company.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.720]   And I think that's fantastic.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720]   Good for that.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720]   Good for that.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.720]   I old boss Steve Newhouse.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720]   Smart man.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.040]   I worked for Steve for almost 12 years.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.040]   And to his incredible credit, Steve understands interactivity online, understood it before.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.040]   I was saying to anybody.
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.920]   He beat it into my head.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.560]   But he understood that this was really a place to talk.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.360]   And people talk about high school wrestling and all kinds of stuff.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.400]   So he really respects all that.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.840]   And that's why he bought Reddit.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.800]   Because he understood how great it was.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.800]   When he wanted to get...
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.040]   Funny what Steve was also...
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   Steve...
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   Don't think I'm telling you stories out of school here.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.280]   Steve, when Facebook started...
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.880]   But when it was just at Yale, he said, "This is going to be huge.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.040]   This is big."
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.040]   And Steve was a...
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.600]   Or started at Harvard.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.440]   Steve was a yay-ly.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.400]   And he wanted to make contact.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.720]   And I tried as an executive in the company to get contact with Facebook executives.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.720]   And I met...
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.360]   What's his name?
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.560]   The scorned friend who...
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.560]   Oh.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.560]   Saverin.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.560]   Saverin.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.560]   Eduardo.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.120]   And I tried to say, "You guys really want to talk to this big deal media executive?"
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.400]   No, he could help you out.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.560]   I could never get any contact back.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.560]   Never.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560]   And so Steve understood that...
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.600]   Eduardo was forced out, by the way.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.400]   And the same thing happened with...
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   With...
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400]   With Dig.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.080]   Steve saw the value of Dig and he couldn't get a piece of Dig.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.440]   So he saw Reddit and he said, "I'm going to grab that first part of...
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.440]   Smart man.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.280]   When he bought Reddit, by the way, and Reddit won, Dig is dead, practically.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:03.640]   When he bought Reddit in 2006, 700,000 page views a day, which is fairly small.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.840]   Now it's that much in 15 minutes.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840]   So...
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.400]   What's interesting about it is that it is open source to the extent that you can run.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.720]   It's federated in a way, right?
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.640]   No, we have a Reddit.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.680]   We have a Reddit for TNT, our news show.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.920]   So we have our own...
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920]   What is it?
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.920]   TNT.Reddit.com.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.920]   So we have our own...
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920]   Something like that.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.920]   Something like that.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:23.920]   We have our own Reddit.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920]   I've been thinking about doing that for the other shows.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.280]   I mean, that's so cool and you can do the up-down voting and everything.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.440]   I'm watching carefully to see how that works for TNT because I think it's a great idea.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.040]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.280]   Suggested user list.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.800]   You want it?
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.800]   I have no idea.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   Where is it?
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.800]   I can't find it.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   I can't see it unless you're new to Google+.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.360]   I think you're all on it.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   Are we?
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.360]   I think all of you are.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   I know Gina is.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360]   Gina and Leo, I think.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.360]   I'm not sure if you're not.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.360]   Yeah, I think if you go to plus.google.com/follo.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.800]   Jack, we'll be on it.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800]   I don't follow.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.360]   Maybe suggest.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.360]   I went to it once.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.640]   You know, if you look at all the threads about it.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.120]   I looked it quickly and I didn't think we were on it.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120]   We technology.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.800]   We're in tech.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.800]   You two are.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800]   I think Gina is.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.800]   I know Gina is.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   Suggested.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.160]   This is the thing that killed Twitter, by the way.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160]   I think.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.960]   It's what made Ashton Kutcher and his ilk superstars on Twitter.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:25.560]   When you have Bradley, you've got a playboy playmate on this, right?
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:30.320]   So it's pretty clear that Google's going for the gold.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.560]   When you do that, your parents Hilton is on it.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:38.080]   And Violet Blue, who they blocked for having a non-real name we get before.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.240]   Is Violet Blue really on it?
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.240]   It's a stir.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.240]   It's Violet Blue is on it.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240]   Yes.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:48.000]   It's weird because the suggested user list really benefits new users, but it can mess
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.440]   with the community in general, right?
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   Because you have that.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.440]   That's the issue.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.440]   There's better ways to do it.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:55.600]   The problem with new users, you know, I'm sure you've all heard of people.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.840]   They join Google+, they accept our invitation, they get in there, they break it.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.840]   I hate it.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:00.840]   I hate it, right?
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.840]   They need a starter kit.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.560]   But to me, the starter kit should be shared lists.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.480]   I should be able to share a circle of my recommended people.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:12.280]   I have in the list there's a guy named Ralph Rothman, who's a German who did really nice
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   service.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.480]   You'll find it there under the G+ list.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.360]   So here's the suggested user list that new users see.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:23.560]   Nobel laureate, Muhammad Yunus is on it, right next to Paris Hilton.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.520]   I like that juxtaposition, by the way.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.520]   Then Mark Cuban.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.520]   Steve will leave you there.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   I have to write a book about Google, too.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.960]   Yeah, Steven Levy, but not Jeff Jarvis, Taylor Swift, Tom Anderson, Thomas Hock, Trey
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.040]   Ratcliffe, Tom's boyfriend.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:45.320]   And notice by the way, no Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson, who's only posted three times,
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:46.320]   Ashton Kutcher.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.160]   Oh dear.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.320]   And by the way, Bradley did post on Twitter saying if you have more than 100,000 followers
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.960]   on Twitter, let me know.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.800]   Let's go to a technology which you have to scroll down and see where at the bottom.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.680]   Yeah, we're like beyond the little little little little.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.360]   There's Veronica Vic, Tom, Timo Riley, MG.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.640]   Oh, Malek, Mike Elgin.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   It's kind of the obvious, the obvious.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.360]   I don't see everybody.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.280]   I don't see everyone.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:15.280]   Oh, how about.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.920]   Okay, what's your name?
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:17.920]   Who's in news?
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.120]   See, this is what's, oh, by the way, fun and interesting April Summers played by Playmate.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:28.560]   I actually had to create a special sexy circle for her and Jesse June.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560]   They're.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.800]   Hey, you know, it's my job.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.800]   I just doesn't go on your sexy circle.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:38.400]   Yeah, but we'll start your remorse lawyers.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.160]   Photography is a tough one because there's so many good photographers.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.960]   This is the first you should be.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.880]   So the thing is that this is misguided is that actually plus isn't as good for famous
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   people as Twitter is.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   Well, they want it to be.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.640]   Oh, you mean the functionality isn't?
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:02.200]   If you follow a famous person on plus, you get sort of invaded by their followers, which
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.640]   is the same problem we have with buzz.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.440]   If you follow Leo and accidentally comment on one of his posts, your inbox is spam forever
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.920]   and plus still has a lot of that problem.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:17.040]   And it's something that Twitter actually gets right in that because every post is the same
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:22.920]   level, but also because you don't get to see comments on somebody else's thing unless
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:28.520]   they're sharing with you too, you don't get this sort of weird effect of one person to
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.200]   be able to take over the conversation that you get with classic mailing lists and things
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.840]   and plus inherits that problem.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:38.880]   And that's something that they're going to have to iterate on before this actually makes
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.880]   sense for celebrities.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.920]   And Neil Gaiman wrote a good post about this a month ago or so when he left plus for this
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:51.080]   very reason because he can happily flirt with his wife on Twitter and have million people
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.400]   watching him without it being annoying for him.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.640]   But more importantly, without being annoying for us who follow because we don't get all
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.840]   the little silly responses that he can see if he chooses to, they don't get inflicted
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.840]   on us.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:08.000]   So there's a bunch of stuff that is possible with Twitter because in some ways Twitter
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.880]   is optimized for bantering in a way that plus isn't because plus tries to let you post
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.600]   these sort of essays in there.
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.880]   It means that you're always at the mercy of the person who wants to write the longest
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]   post there.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:27.160]   Conan O'Brien puts his TV studio on Airbnb for $1 night.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:32.720]   Cozy and charming, one bathroom studio, celebrity, gray, sleeper sofa and a 40 ton industrial
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.560]   air conditioning system, a kitchenette with its own intern, 25 LCD televisions but no
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.520]   HBO and a shower, although that has to be shared with guest bands.
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520]   Only four nights are available.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.680]   Do you think anybody's actually, yes, I think they actually are serious about this.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:52.280]   They're asking you to email Team Coco saying why you'd like the room.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.080]   You should go and do a share that, Leo.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.400]   I would love to do that.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.760]   It's only, it's in Burbank.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.160]   I could get down there for that.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.560]   I think that's hysterical.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.480]   Triple X domains go on sale Wednesday.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.080]   Anybody buying one?
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:11.040]   I suppose it's a straight line for me.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.200]   Publicparts.xx.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.200]   There we go.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.200]   There we go.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.200]   Excited.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.200]   I don't know.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.640]   Groupon's putting off its IPO saying the stock market sucks.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.400]   They're never going to get it off, are they?
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.520]   No, that's been a one company bubble since the start.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:34.320]   I like the memo that the CEO wrote, the private memo during their quiet period that somehow
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.240]   leaked out.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.560]   Debunking all the people who were saying bad things about Groupon.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.400]   I thought it showed spunk and I hate spunk.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.680]   All right, we're going to get our tip, our number, and our tool of the week.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.640]   But first a plug, just a brief plug for NewTech.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.400]   Do some great NewTech transitions.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.840]   This is the video switcher that we use, the incredible TriCaster 8500.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.440]   Extreme, we're TriCaster powered.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.480]   Couldn't do it without them.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:07.440]   And we have just gone out to our designer to get some motion graphics, design, and double
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440]   boxes.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.280]   And we're going to, you're going to hate this.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.640]   You're going to hate Twitch by the time we're done with this.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.560]   There'll be things flying in and out and over and around.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.920]   You're going to, we're going to tart this place up like nobody's business.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.400]   You heard it here first.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.320]   You're going to hate Twitch.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.440]   Thanks to NewTech and the TriCaster 8500.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.440]   Extreme.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.040]   No, actually we love it.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.800]   And if you are, if you're looking at video production, people ask me all the time.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.800]   Do look at the TriCaster.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.800]   It is amazing.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:40.360]   NewTech, and EWTK.com/TrinCaster.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.760]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.000]   I actually have a quick plug for something that Jeff and I worked on.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   It's a book called N. Malaria.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.640]   If you go to NmalariaDay.com.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.120]   Dang, we're doing that.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.880]   It just went on sale through Amazon, Seth Godin's Domino project.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:58.880]   It's $20 book.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.760]   $20 goes to Malaria Nomura, which is an organization which buys mosquito nets for folks.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.360]   Who need them, which prevents the spread of malaria.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.120]   An inexpensive thing you can do that saves lives.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.120]   Exactly.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.840]   And it's a great book too, which is, I just got my copy yesterday.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840]   It's a collection of essays.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.320]   I think it's 60 writers, including Jeff and I.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.120]   Jeff did a great essay about beta sync from people like David Allen and Dan Pink and Kevin
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.120]   Kelly.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.120]   Wow.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.480]   So it's a really good book to begin with, but also $20 to the purchase price, which Amazon
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.000]   subsidized is going to go to Malaria no more.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   So check that out.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   Buy a few for your friends.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   At MalariaDay.com.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   Yep.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   Yep.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.160]   And so my real tip is that Google Voice, the data liberation front at Google has gotten
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.880]   its paws on Google Voice.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.600]   So you can now take out your data from Google Voice.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.880]   If you go to believe it's Google.com/takeout, which you should visit if you use any Google
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.480]   products.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   Look at these guys.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.720]   Fits did a great video here.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.880]   Fits is so funny.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   I swear to God.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:05.040]   And this was a little bit controversial because some people were saying, well, isn't this
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.200]   an invasion of privacy?
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200]   I don't think so.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.760]   If you leave me a voicemail message and I want to download a big deal, it's, you know, I
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.760]   mean, you left it with me.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.800]   Yeah, you left the voicemail in the game.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:16.800]   Jesus.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.800]   What price been you?
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.800]   You could already right click them because they were mp3s.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.800]   Right.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.800]   So really, come on.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.160]   So if you go into Google, take out, you can choose Google Voice.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.880]   You can export the mp3s and the transcription files.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.880]   I did it.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.760]   I had like 40 megabytes of Google Voice messages.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.680]   So it's just just good to know you can get your data out.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   I love it.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.680]   Great tip.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.680]   Great tip.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.840]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, sir.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:46.760]   Google, this will go to Kevin's heart, says that Gmail is 80 times greener than in-house
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:47.760]   mail.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.280]   And I hate to think how much greener it is than real mail because the cloud is greener
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.360]   and better.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:57.920]   And having all these computers doing too little in too many places is using too much
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.520]   power.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:06.120]   And they say that on YouTube, for example, a play a minute of a YouTube video comes to
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:12.040]   0.0002 kilowatt hours of energy.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.960]   And so you'd have to watch YouTube for three straight days for our servers to consume the
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:20.360]   amount of energy required to manufacture, package and ship a single DVD.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.360]   Wow.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.480]   So the cloud is not light.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.480]   It's green.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.480]   It's green.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.480]   See?
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   See?
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:33.280]   I did a post about this a couple of years back because somebody said that you're doing
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.240]   Google searches, you use as much energy as boiling a kettle because every query do touches
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240]   thousands of servers.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.360]   It's like, well, except that those servers are also serving several million other queries
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.120]   at the same time.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.760]   And then if you actually did the maths, if you just held your breath while doing the
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.440]   search, you would not--
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.440]   Save enough CO2.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:55.680]   So everybody who wants to be green, hold your breath when you do a search.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.320]   I wish for Google searches to their fast, which works for--
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.320]   That's true.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320]   Speed is good.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.800]   I want to mention is my tool of the week.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.280]   Now, Gina, please don't take this wrong.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.240]   I love to do.txt.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.240]   It's fantastic.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.000]   Everybody should go to todotext.com.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.560]   A great, very straightforward command line-based to-do thing.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:18.160]   But I've been wanting some way to integrate with Google tasks because Google has a to-do
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.160]   list.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.440]   And I found a really good way to do it on an Android phone.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.440]   It's called Astrid.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.000]   Astrid is great.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   It's got lots of features.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.600]   If you want to feature is free, they do have a power pack for $4 and a locale add-on for
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.080]   a bug 50.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.600]   But one of the things I like about it is Astrid.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.760]   And you could put this into to-do text.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:38.680]   Astrid says things like, come on, let's get something done.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.840]   The notifications in Astrid are fantastic.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.160]   They really make you want to do the thing on the to-do list.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.800]   Great announcements.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:54.360]   And most importantly, I think, which is fantastic, is it ties into Google tasks.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:58.280]   So finally, you can sync your Google tasks and get it into Astrid.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.120]   And you can dictate, by the way, it takes voice dictation as well, which is, I think,
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.520]   great for to-do lists.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.840]   A-S-T-R-I-D.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.880]   If you're not using to-do text, this is another good choice for Android.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.360]   Astrid has tons and tons of features.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.080]   And it's got a cute little mascot.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.640]   So to-do text is super stripped down by design.
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:18.480]   But for anybody who really wants more features, Astrid is definitely the way to go.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:22.160]   Yeah, to-do text is if you're like, keep your fingers on the keyboard at all times.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.160]   Right.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.200]   And there's a great Android version, which I've purchased and I love.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:31.480]   This is more like, yeah, this is kind of crazy personality-driven.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.360]   It's got a widget.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.880]   If you buy the power pack, you can speak your to-dos, which is fantastic.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.360]   And I do think the fact that it syncs the Gmail tasks is huge.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.360]   Great.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   Yep.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360]   So that's my tool of the week.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.960]   Thank you so much, Kevin Marks, for being here.
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.400]   Kevin works for Salesforce.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.880]   I think we could say that now.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:53.920]   He's also @KevinMarks on Twitter and Kevin Marks on Google+.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:54.920]   You're on Google+, right?
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.120]   Yes, yes, I'm on Google+.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:02.280]   I don't actually post much there because I find it not as useful as writing a blog post
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.320]   because you can't actually indent anything or put links anywhere in it.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   So I didn't write much there.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.280]   But I didn't write much more blog like that.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.600]   And by the way, you have a 2009 blog post.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.520]   Our chatroom is so good.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:15.720]   Called "Hold your breath while Googling to save the planet."
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.280]   You thought of this years ago.
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.280]   Years ago.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.280]   I love that.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.480]   Thank you so much for being here, Kevin.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.480]   We really appreciate it.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.480]   It's always great to have.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   I always enjoyed it.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.680]   It's great fun to talk to you guys.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.680]   Thanks.
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.080]   We should make him a semi-regular, I think, really, because he's so good.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.080]   I think he already is.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:33.080]   He really is.
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.480]   I kind of like him so much.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.480]   We love having him on.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.960]   In fact, when he's not on and we're having a discussion that he has an opinion on, you'll
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.480]   see him in the chatroom going, "Let me talk.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:41.480]   Let me talk."
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   "Let me talk."
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.200]   Which I actually appreciate.
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   I love it.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.560]   Jeff Jarvis, his new book, "Public Parts is out September 27th.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.720]   Go pre-order it on Amazon.com.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:56.640]   Both Kindle and paper versions, and I hope audio versions soon.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.920]   Will it come out day and date on the audio?
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:31:59.920]   I believe so.
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.640]   Oh, that's great.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.640]   Very good news.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.200]   I've got a total.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.200]   Yes.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.080]   Buzzmachine.com is his boo-dog.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.520]   And finally, Gina Trapani at smarterware.org.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.800]   That's her blog.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:17.880]   She also writes for a lot of other great sites and occasionally on Google+ as well as Gina
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   Trapani.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.880]   Great to be here.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   And malariaday.com.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:21.880]   And malariaday.com.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:26.440]   And by the way, they were telling me in the chatroom that Google Docs was down.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.680]   We use Google Docs for our show notes.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.360]   And I had been using it, but I just noticed it is down.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.520]   So I don't know how long it will be down for.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:39.200]   What is the dashboard for Google's uptime, Google's server?
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:40.760]   I could probably Google that.
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:42.400]   I can see you guys.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.400]   Can you see it?
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.400]   Is this because people are asking for Google Docs offline and they misunderstood?
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:53.840]   Google Docs offline started to roll out this week.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.480]   Maybe there's something going on there.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.840]   And it just was very slow.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.280]   I think it just came.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.560]   No, it's just very slow, maybe.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.920]   Anyway, Google.com app status is--
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.920]   There we go.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.440]   And what does the app status say for Google Docs right now?
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.320]   It says service disruption.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.880]   Service disruption.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.360]   It's official.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.320]   You saw it here first.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.360]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.480]   We do this show every Wednesday, 1 p.m.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.000]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.400]   That's 2000 UTC at twit.tv.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.840]   Check out our new website.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.240]   We appreciate the feedback on that.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.720]   We're doing all we can to make it better.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.480]   And we appreciate anything you have to say.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.920]   Do we email a colon?
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.520]   C-O-L-I-N at twit.tv.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.840]   Don't email me.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.160]   And what else?
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:35.800]   That's about it.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.360]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.840]   Can I play us out with a doodle?
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.920]   Play us out with the Freddie Mercury doodle.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.120]   Yes, and we love this.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.080]   Love this.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.080]   We love this.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:53.040]   Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:34:01.160]   I feel like I have the world.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.560]   I'm turning inside out here.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:14.080]   I'm floating around in ecstasy, so don't stop me now.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.080]   Don't stop me.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.080]   'Cause I'm having a good time.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.080]   Having a good time.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.080]   I shouldn't stop leaping to the sky like a tiger.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.080]   You're buying the laws of gravity.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.080]   I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Gudiver.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.080]   I'm gonna go, go, go.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.080]   There's no stopping me.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.080]   I'm running through the sky.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.080]   200 degrees, just running, coming just a foreign hike.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.080]   I'm traveling at the speed of light.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:51.080]   I wanna make a super sonic man out of you.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:54.080]   Don't stop me now.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   I'm having such a good time.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.080]   I'm having a ball.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.080]   Don't stop me now.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.080]   If you wanna have a good time.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.080]   Just give me a call.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.080]   Don't stop me now.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.080]   Don't stop me now.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.080]   Don't stop me now.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.080]   Good time.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.080]   I don't wanna stop me now.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:22.080]   Six months in the making,
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:25.080]   contribute to Freddie, the late Freddie Mercury of Queen.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.080]   They raised the Doodle Bar at that one.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.080]   I think it has to be the most elaborate Google Doodle ever.
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:30.080]   Pretty incredible.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.080]   Wow.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.080]   And thank you, Eileen.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.080]   Great way to end the show.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.660]   (guitar chime)
