[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Kind of the cloudy, socially future thingy.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis, he's professor of journalism at the City University of New York who is proud to say he is tenured.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I saw your tweet.

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hey.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Thanks for being patient. We're a little late today because of the Amazon announcement. We'll talk about the fire phone in just a second.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Also here, of course, host of all about Android.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Creator of ThinkUp at ThinkUp.com, Gina Trapani, founding editor at Life Hacker iGena.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Hey, good to be here.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Now, did you last night on all about Android? Did you kind of speculate about what Amazon might be up to with their new phone?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yeah, well, you know, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday it was going to be an AT&T exclusive.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So we talked about that a little bit. I mean, honestly, not yesterday, but we had heard kind of rumors of maybe like some sort of Amazon Prime data plan that didn't really come to fruition, right?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   It's just kind of a standard two year contract with AT&T, right?
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yeah, it's very standard. You know, the only deal is if you're a Prime member, you get a year of Prime free, which is like a $99 discount.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, that's something. I thought it was going to be a little bit more prime oriented. Like the phone is free if you get Prime or you get some sort of special data plan.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That's Amazon. I don't know. My imagination kind of gone wild without a little bit because I think there's room for a lot of innovation around contracts and, you know, the way that carriers work here in the US is, you know, so awful.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I was thinking, well, Amazon's really going to, you know, they're going to draw in Prime members and they're going to offer something. You know, we haven't seen before.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So they didn't with the carrier situation. It didn't feel that way. You do get that Prime discount.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But it's pretty much, in fact, I think Paul Theron observed this a testament to the power of the carriers.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah, that was an interesting comment. It's true. Yeah. You can't do an Amazon phone anymore. You know, you have to have a carrier.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Even Amazon doesn't have enough market cloud to do it to go its own way.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   What's a whisper nut? Is that? Is that? That's the way that you can be listening to the book and then it syncs with when you're reading the book.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   No, that's whisper sync. Oh, whisper net. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right now.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So when Amazon first came out with a Kindle, you may remember they offered unlimited lifetime 3G connections.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So you could download your book anytime, anywhere. Originally it was with Sprint.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   There was no Wi-Fi, indeed. There was no Wi-Fi. Right. And now it's with AT&T.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So it's basically internet access on the Kindles.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   But it was originally on like the basic, you know, E-ink Kindle.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Right. Right. So I sort of thought, oh, maybe whisper net. You know, I don't know what network that is.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's AT&T. It's AT&T in the back. It's 3G.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah. 5G. You know, maybe Amazon will give free access to Amazon.com, but we didn't really see that.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You know, I had kind of given up on that because they didn't do it with a Fire TV.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   That's $9.99 bucks. They didn't do it. They haven't subsidized anything.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I guess the Kindle HDX, the Kindle Fire tablets are less expensive, but they're roughly Nexus 7 pricing.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   They're not wildly inexpensive. Amazon has always said, hey, we don't have to make money on the device.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   We make money when you use it. But apparently they've decided to make money on both sides now.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Because that's an expensive phone. $650 unsubsidized for the 32 gig version, $750 for the 64 gig version.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It'll be shipping June 20, I'm sorry, July 25th, five weeks.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But there are some interesting things. And I think for this crowd, the most interesting thing is this is an Android phone.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   But at this point, barely, at this point, I would propose that we can now say, they call it FireOS 3.5,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   that there is a fourth, you know, major mobile OS. You've got iOS, you've got Android, you've got Windows phone.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And now I think you can safely say that FireOS is not Android.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's not skin.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And it's not skinned Android. It's not like a touch whizz or sense.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's amputated Android.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah, you would. I mean, they don't mention Android. The on time they use the word on the page.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah, they usually want starts with Android.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Oh, really? Yes.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Well, that's it. That's a departure.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   They never said that with the Kindle Fire.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   About the, you know, OS 3.5 or whatever.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It starts with Android. I think that's for developers to say, look, your Android app is going to work on this stuff.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Yeah, that's definitely about developers. Yeah, I mean, there's Google, there's Google Android, and then there's FireOS.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I think that FireOS is a very legitimate and will be very widespread. Android fork.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I mean, I think it's legitimate to call it a fork.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Yeah, it's definitely a fork.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's a fork of what? What code did they start with? 422?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   AOSP. I'm not sure what version.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But, I mean, they're the first company to sort of successfully, you know, build an entire proprietary layer, right, on top of the AOSP to replace Google services.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   That's where Google's competing, right, with Google services and play services and the play store and all those things.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So it makes me happy because it's like, oh, yes, Android truly is open.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   There is an opportunity here. I mean, I think a lot of people for a long time said, "Andrew, is it really open?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   There actually is an opportunity. Nobody would ever start from Android and build their own thing. They would just start from scratch."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Well, we don't need to start from scratch anymore. The operating system is built.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Now it's about the services and the cloud APIs.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And in fact, it's kind of an interesting part.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Amazon is one of the few companies with enough size of cloud and money to provide those services itself.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It looks like, in fact, we know this now, it's licensed to the Nokia here maps for the maps.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And those are actually arguably as good as Google maps, if not better. I think they're very good.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So that's where it's getting its maps.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   You don't have a play store because for a long time, Amazon has done its own store, 200,000 apps in their store.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Yeah, the App Store.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   They can even argue it's more curated than the play store, right?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It's smaller.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Of course, those apps don't have access to Google Play games, Google Play services, which, you know, that's the part of the Google experience.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But yeah, I uploaded my app to the Amazon App Store. My sales are not nearly what they are on the play store.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But yeah, it's there.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   How hard was it? What did it involve to get your -- is it to do text? You're talking about?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah, to do text.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yep.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Well, my app is pretty simple.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And does it interact with any of the Google APIs or proprietary Google APIs?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It interacts, of course, with the Dropbox API. It uses the Android SDK for Dropbox, which is, you know, available for free from Dropbox.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And so submitting it to the Amazon App Store, I didn't have to make any modifications.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The same exact APK that I've loaded to the Google Play Store.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   There's a review process.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It took some time for them to review it and get back to me.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And in fact, at one point, one of my versions -- I've uploaded several versions to this point -- got stuck in the review queue for a really long time.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I had to kind of get in touch and nudge them. I don't know what happened. It fell down a hole or something.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   But that's really the main difference is that there's a review process and the sales are not as high, right?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   As in the play store. With the play store, you upload it and the binary just goes.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Well, it takes some time for the play store cache to clear, but you're talking about a few hours.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Amazon has contacted me quite a few times, asking if I wanted to make my app the free app of the day, because I do a bunch of free apps.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I was asking if my app is $2, which was nice and flattering.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I turned them down because I was like, "Hey, if I wanted to give this away for free, I would have just set the price tag to zero."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   What are the terms of that? They don't give you any money. Free is free for that week.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Free is free.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Yeah, free is free.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Interesting. But you can turn them down.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Yeah, you can. You just say, "No thanks." You have to agree, obviously.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   So they lose maps, but apparently they have the 1.0 API available if you wanted to use maps.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   So if you wanted to use a map and to do that text, you'd have to use the 1.0 API, but you could call the here maps using that.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   You lose messaging, which means you lose hangouts, you lose voice. That may be more significant, right?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I mean, not really, because I mean, Android just has these hooks in to share or to, you know, there's the generic hooks where it's like, "Here's a web page. You click on it."
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   If you have multiple browsers installed, it's like, "Hey, what's default app do you want to use if you don't?"
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I mean, if there's, you know, there are generic hooks to invoke the dialer or whatever version of Android you're running.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Of course, hangouts is proprietary, but I think with Android's Intense and the Share menu,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   if your app isn't too embedded into the Google ecosystem, you know, if you're not using Google Play games and leaderboards and Google Maps specifically,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   you can build a pretty generic Android app that hooks into the low-level system APIs that let you customize it, you know, no matter what layer you're in.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Of course, Google's making this harder to do, right, because their proprietary services are increasingly, you know, more attractive.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   What do you lose?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   What is it that you-- what is it?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Updates?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Yeah, your Amazon now is incumbent on them to keep the OS up to date, but yeah, I mean, they significantly changed it, so that's not a surprise.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Yeah, I mean, the mapping-- if you're building a game, you know, Google Play games is great.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You get to get leaderboards and achievements and you get the social connections.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But Amazon has an equivalent, don't they? They have an Amazon game.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I'm not sure, do they?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I think so.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I don't think--
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I don't think I don't think to the extent-- and you know, Google's only going to make this, you know, more.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   We have another story on the rundown.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Google Fit is going to be a big thing, and it'll probably-- it sounds like it'll operate a lot like Google Play games, where it's a platform for fitness apps to talk to it versus just the fitness app of itself.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So, yeah, the Amazon phone doesn't have Bluetooth LE, I saw.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Yeah, no Bluetooth 4, it's Bluetooth 3.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It has NFC, that's good, but it doesn't have Bluetooth LE.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   That's a little bit of a surprise.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   But what it does have-- there are a couple of things I find very interesting.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   One is this Firefly button, the physical button on the side of the phone.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   When you press it within one second, the camera is launched, and much like Google's goggles, you can point it at stuff, and it will be identified.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I mean, obviously, the first intent is that you point it at a product, and it not only identifies it, but I presume brings up Amazon's page for it, so you can buy it.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   So, if we hear Google screamed out about using their market position, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, every retailer in the country.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Can you imagine how best buy is worried about this?
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Oh.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Because, I mean, you know, we all do it now. I mean, I go to the bookstore and I shoot it because I also don't have NUC.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Right.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Can't you identify paintings? They showed Renaissance paintings.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   If it sees a phone number on a sign, it will give you the number and it will give you a chance to dial it.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   So, as you're driving by a real estate sign, you could point the phone at it and firefly the number and call.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That's going to be easy for everybody else to catch up on, though, isn't it?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Yeah, that is going to be great, but yeah, that's software.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   In fact, Google bought WordLens, remember, the automatic translation software.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Yeah, I mean, I feel like these are features that Google's had with goggles, almost every one of these.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   But it's not about a button away, but yeah.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   It doesn't sell merchandise, so although they are starting to do deals, aren't they with people like Best Buy for delivery?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Maybe.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Maybe this pushes Google ahead on that process.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   But, you know, I'm waiting for the story to be. It'll come out soon.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You know, some, some store somewhere will try to ban use of phones while you're shopping.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Oh, everyone will.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   If I were Best Buy, I'd immediately say, "You may not bring this thing in here."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Show-rooming is the term, right? Where you going?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Well, it's the best, no, Bill, have you been in Best Buy lately?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah, and there's, there might as well buy it online.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   There's nobody here.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   It's all, it's all marketing space for Samsung and Microsoft and Google.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Right.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   That's not they're making the money now.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Now, somebody said, and this makes, this is interesting, that the, the payment API is easier to use for Amazon than it is for Google.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   So, Google goes through the wallet. Amazon, obviously, everybody who has an Amazon phone has an Amazon, has a credit card with them.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Yes, that, that hadn't occurred to me, but that doesn't, that, that's probably absolutely true.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And Amazon made a big point about having an SDK for Firefly so that your app, even Best Buy, could write an app that says,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   "Hey, take a picture of it and we'll, and then order it from Best Buy."
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Right.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Yep.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Yep.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I, I, I, I immediately ordered one, of course, because it's my job, but I'm very intrigued by it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Has an excellent camera.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I have no desire.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   I, I, you know, I'm put a gadget in front of me and I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, ring a bell and I'll start celebrating.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   But nothing.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   The, the, the, and then by the way, it wasn't 3D, I think it was widely misreported as 3D.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   The phone does not have 3D, it has what they call dynamic perspective.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Uh, four cameras on the front and the four corners that know where your head is, not only, not only angle and position in front of it, but how far away it is.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   The Z, the ZX is how far away it is.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And then based on that, they can modify the image so that you can look around columns.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   You can, you can kind of look around by just moving your head.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   This is a limited appeal, it seems.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Although they did show a game that apparently, uh, uses it.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Again, another product that has an API.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   You know what I think is very interesting.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Have you ever used the May Day feature on your Kindle?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I don't really use the Kindle.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I use Kindle app on my Nexus 7.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So I have, I use it on the Fire HD X, you press a button.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Uh, you get lonely?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Apparently a lot of people who are lonely call this.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Uh, you, you within 15 seconds, actually the average time Amazon released this last week is 9.75 seconds.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   You, uh, person will answer, you'll see a video of them, they'll see a video of you.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   They can control your device, at least on the Kindle Fire HD X.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   They can control your device, I presume it'll be the same on the Fire phone.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Um, they can help you.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   AT&T says you, they'll also have the ability to transfer you to AT&T if you need customer service on your phone, you know, for the, with the network.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Uh, we were talking on our launch, uh, and Mike Elgin said they probably will have emergency services as well, right?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Uh, so you, it's like calling 911.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Uh, I think this, this May Day button, I think is a, is a selling point for first time.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Oh, I can't imagine that.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   What that liability.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Oh, oh, okay.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   But what if you call them up and you're bleeding from the head and you say, help me.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   What are they going to do?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Hang up on you, Jeff.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   They absolutely have that liability.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Oof.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I don't want that.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   So, yeah, I think I'm not going to make it, I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I can't make it.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I'm not going to make it.

[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I'm not going to make it.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.720]   You make a good point that on your Chromebook, at least you can't use Skype.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.600]   Although I suppose Microsoft could decide to do a Chrome plugin for Skype, that's really
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.840]   more Microsoft's choice.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.080]   Google wouldn't stop them from doing that.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.760]   Doing a Chrome app, a Skype Chrome app.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   Right.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.240]   Nothing to stop them from doing that.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:38.520]   I think Google has at least a bias in favor of open that Apple does not have Microsoft's
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.800]   oddly enough historically not had and is moving more towards that we were talking about this
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:50.320]   on Windows Weekly, that this is very uncharacteristic, but they released the iPad version of Office
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   before they released the Surface version.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.800]   They're really kind of said, "We're going to be cross-platform."
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.160]   Microsoft may be moving in that direction, but Amazon's never going to move in that.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.600]   Amazon knows what its business is.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.880]   And Google's strategy was, that was the entire Amazon strategy was opening it up.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.280]   You could say that Amazon used it against them.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.160]   But here's a different question then.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.800]   If you're Google, how do you exploit what Amazon has just done?
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.000]   Well, you do one thing that does is just as Gina said, it confirms what you've said
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.680]   all along and right is open.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.800]   That lets you off a lot, it lets you off the hook.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:39.480]   I think that maybe Amazon has made a mistake by offering SDKs for Firefly, it's purchasing
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.200]   technology and for the dynamic perspective.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.720]   See the problem with dynamic perspective is no other phone can do it or can it?
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   I don't know.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   It's just a GPU accelerated thing, right?
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.320]   Yeah, that's a good question, but likely it's just for that phone right now.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.760]   And nobody's going to cross platform that or want to do it, frankly.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.080]   It's not interesting enough to want to make it on the iPhone.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.600]   iPhone could do it for sure.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.320]   It multiplies fragmentation a little bit from the developer side.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.960]   It's like, I'm going to compile this AVK.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.240]   It talks to these SDKs for Amazon.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.600]   I'm going to compile one for Google.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.280]   I'm going to compile one for whatever.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   It's not--
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.040]   And it has to go through approval processes for all of them too.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   Right.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.760]   It's not Amazon right now.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.760]   But yeah, yes.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.360]   But it wasn't onerous, was it?
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360]   Did they?
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.240]   No, I mean, it's at the upload it.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.600]   And you say, hey, you check the box and many email when my results are back.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.000]   And then you get an automated email a couple days later.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.240]   It's just one of those things where it makes it difficult to plan a launch, whatever.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.280]   I'm a small indie developer, it says this is a weekend project, but it makes it a little
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.560]   harder to plan a launch.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.840]   And you have to kind of get ahead of it.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.840]   How long before Amazon releases its own language that's proprietary?
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   Jesus.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   Like Apple did.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.360]   All right, let's talk.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   So OK, the other shoe is going to drop though.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   Next week, it's Google I/O.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   Right.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.760]   And Google-- this has been a wonderful month for those of us who cover technology.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.880]   We've had so much to see and hear and play with.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.320]   And Google gets the last word.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   Nice timing, Google.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   True.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:29.640]   Is it good or are they rushing to match a feature announcement today?
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.680]   I would think not.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   No.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.280]   But they're certainly going to get to say, they're going to get to respond.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:44.040]   And I imagine we'll respond with some things that only Android Open handset alliance can
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.920]   do, like, for instance, this health thing.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   The health thing.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.520]   And look, Google's going to tell-- and they would have done this anyway.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.080]   They're going to tell the distribution power or the play store.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.240]   I mean, they're going to talk about how many billions of downloads, how many active users.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.520]   They're going to talk about how many of those users-- I think it's over 70% now or KitKat
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.920]   or Jelly Bean.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.200]   So the fragmentation problem is basically not more--
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.320]   No more toxic health too.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   Right.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   No more toxic health too.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   Right.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   Exactly.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.000]   At this point, they're not racing to answer with any features, but they can certainly just
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.480]   tweak their slides to address any of this stuff.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   I don't know.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.200]   If there's anything here that Google is even going to-- I'll be surprised, actually, if
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.640]   they address Amazon at all during the keynote.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.600]   We should start some bets.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   Yeah, really.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   You have a big go to cheat anyway.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.600]   Forget drinking game, yeah.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   So you two are going to be there.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.800]   You're going to be in the room and then we'll do this week at Google.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.160]   After the keynote ends, you'll drive up here.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.760]   Jeff with his eyes tightly closed.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.480]   And we'll do the show from here.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   I don't know.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.920]   Everybody that we use normally who covers Google is at the event.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.400]   So I'm going to be all alone here covering it live.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   They are live streaming it.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.240]   We'll cover it the live stream.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.640]   I'm sure Mike Elgin-- no, no.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.240]   He's going to be there too.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   Jesus.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.480]   I think we got Matthew Ingram.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   Right?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.480]   You might want to ask Ron because he didn't get in.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.480]   OK, we'll get Ron Richards from all about Android.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   There you go.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.480]   Ron, excellent.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   There you go.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.080]   Ron Richards, Matthew Ingram and me, the three people who didn't get invited to Google
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   I/O.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   He has a day job, so I don't know.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   Oh, he's going to job.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.480]   Yeah, you tell me.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.400]   Anyway, we'll be covering that.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400]   Is that next week?
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.400]   It's next week.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.240]   We're going to be sitting there first and next week.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.720]   I'm flying to San Francisco tomorrow for a World Economic Forum event on Friday, flying
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   back on Saturday.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.160]   Ooh, weird sunlight.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.120]   And then flying back on Tuesday to be there for I/O and then back on Friday.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.120]   What?
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.920]   You want to stay the weekend and be on Twitch?
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.000]   Do you know the flight attendants and like, do they say, "Oh, hey, Jeff?"
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.120]   I ran into one of my last flight from Berlin.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   I know you.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.120]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.240]   You're on the red eye, huh?
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.240]   Wow.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   You're starting to remind me a little bit of Don Draper here going back and forth and
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   back and forth.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   Or what's his name?
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.880]   What was the great flight movie, the Prequel to Water movie?
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   I am.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.840]   I am global services.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   You are.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.320]   I'm that obnoxious prick.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.840]   Oh, George gets a new one first.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   It was up in the air.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.560]   Up in the air was firing people, right?
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.080]   So everybody on the United now is lined up in these five humongous lines.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   Not you.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   You're there.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.720]   Oh, I do anyway because I'm neurotic.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:35.200]   But first, you know, injured people and then me.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.080]   So excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.080]   And I go to the front of the line.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.360]   It's obnoxious and horrible, but I don't have it.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.400]   One thing we'll see at Google I/O, a response to CarPlay, Apple's technology that puts iPhones
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   in the car.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.600]   Automotive News says, we don't usually report scoops by Automotive News.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.880]   This is the first.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   I'm excited.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.800]   Automotive News says three sources tell it that Google will unveil its first in-car operating
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.880]   system next week at I/O.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.640]   Known internally as Google AutoLink, it'll be the first project to emerge from the Open
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.240]   Automotive Alliance.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.220]   This is a Google-led consortium that includes Audi, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, and
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.440]   NVIDIA, which I guess makes the chips for the whole thing.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.600]   It is not an embedded infotainment system.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.200]   In fact, my Audi has that right now.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.280]   It's QNX, which Blackberry owns.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.920]   But it will be much more like what Apple's doing, which is a projected system so that
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.800]   the display displays stuff that it's getting from the smartphone.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.280]   That makes a lot more sense.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.440]   That also means that it's more updatable in the sense of whatever your phone is at that
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.440]   minute.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.880]   You can project it and use it when you're on the screen.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.720]   But casting to the screen in your car, basically.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   Right.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.600]   Yeah, there's a little Chromecast in the screen.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:03.400]   So expect announcements there and demonstrations for the new GAL, the Google AutoLink.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:09.120]   Google also, according, again, these are rumors, also perhaps see Google Fit.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.600]   Google has tried before to provide a database of health information and ended that a couple
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.320]   of years ago now.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.920]   Microsoft still maintains something.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.320]   And of course, Apple has announced it's going to do HealthKit with a health app.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:32.400]   Google Fit, according to the rumor in Forbes, will also be launched at Google I/O.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.400]   It will aggregate.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.840]   Just this is just like HealthKit through open APIs.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.960]   Instruction sets allow apps to share information.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:46.240]   We'll also announce partnerships with wearable device makers.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.040]   And do things like not only measure steps, but also heart rate.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.720]   It's just all this is a me too.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.520]   I'm wearing the new Samsung Gear 2 watch.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.680]   We finally got a sample of this.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.400]   And they really, this is much nicer than the original Galaxy Gear.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:07.640]   The cameras is built into the bezel now instead of being a big Petruidence, a little pimple
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.400]   on the band.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.520]   You can actually talk to it.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.400]   You can do S voice commands.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.000]   You can talk on the phone with it, I think.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.200]   So this is, do you think we'll see watches next week, right?
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.520]   Not a Google watch.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.120]   I think it's going to be the LG, the rumor is that it's the watch.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.320]   It's the LG G watch.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.040]   So is that what the insiders call it?
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   The watch.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   But it can't be an other watch.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.480]   It only works with two phones.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.520]   I want to see the Moto 360.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.640]   Right, that's the round one.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.560]   So I think the one they're giving away is the square one.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.480]   So you guys are going to be wearing a watch when we become a watch.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.680]   I was saying on AA last night with Google Fit, what I'm hoping to see at I/O next week
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.120]   is RunKeeper and Fitbit.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.200]   Up on stage saying we have integrated our apps with Google Fit and these are the things
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.760]   that made it so much better.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.120]   Those apps have been out for so long and they know so much.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.600]   And I hope that it's about that.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.040]   I hope that it's about Google's platform helping them out versus trying to replace them.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   Here's the question.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.880]   If they do that, does it automatically get on the watch?
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.760]   Or does the watch have to support it?
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.840]   In other words, is the watch like we were talking about with the auto stuff?
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.760]   Is the watch just a way cast to the watch or is the watch its own thing with its own
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.320]   CPU and all of that stuff?
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.400]   Seems like that would be a good way to do that.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.440]   So put less intelligence in the watch itself.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.160]   I actually, my Fitbit broke and so I wanted to just switching, you're running the Fitbit
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.400]   Android app and then switching it to just the device, the device, count my steps.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.160]   So my numbers were a lot lower because there's times that I'm walking around the house and
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.200]   I don't have my phone in my pocket, right?
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.440]   Because it's in the other room.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.560]   But with the watch, I'm never going to take that off.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.320]   So I'm hoping to see a Fitbit or a Fitbit like maybe runkeeper or just another great
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   app.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.320]   Have the Android Wear app that's constantly tracking and also using Google Fit to tell
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:17.440]   me when I've, you know, would ever reach my step goal for that day or burn so many calories.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:23.360]   And so yeah, I mean, I hope that those integrations, the Google Fit perfectly aligned.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   And so I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   I'm going to keep it in.

[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   I'm going to keep it in.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   You have to do this around the whole world.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   British Columbia Justice L.A.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:21.680]   Fenlon ordered Google to remove websites that have stolen intellectual property from
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:28.240]   Equistech Solutions used to manufacture competing products.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.560]   Google had removed Equistech links from Google.ca.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.560]   They wanted more.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.560]   The judge said, "Nope.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:40.160]   I've got to remove them everywhere in the world."
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.880]   I note the judge wrote that on the record before me, the injunction would compel Google
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.440]   to take steps in California or the state in which its search engine is controlled and
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.840]   would not therefore direct that steps be taken around the world, but that the effect
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.560]   of the injunction could reach beyond one state is a separate issue.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.480]   In other words, he says, "You've got to take them out of your search index in California
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.640]   wherever your servers are, but that's a side effect that it does it all over the world."
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.560]   Wherever your servers are.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.280]   It affects my ability to know something.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.640]   I write to know this is really to a very, very dangerous trend in censorship.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:26.040]   She compared them to an innocent warehouse that Google is an innocent warehouse that has
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:31.400]   been forbidden from shipping out goods for companies subjected to an injunction.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.600]   The local order not to ship could also have broader geographical implications.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.560]   This is an example of a real world physical analogy that just doesn't work so good.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   Does work?
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   Canada, get off our lawn.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   It ain't a shipping.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.360]   It ain't a warehouse.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.520]   The right to be forgotten decision in Europe, we have this.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.320]   Jonah O'Sara columnist for the New York Times defended the right to be forgotten, which
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.800]   I find is a journalist shocking.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.120]   They shouldn't have nasty things up there.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.240]   They shouldn't have yucky things up there.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.000]   So what the New York Times should have good news?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.280]   Then we have Joe Scarborough, who went ballistic on Google.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.640]   There's video up, I think, on the rundown on the same issue saying that Google should
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.360]   be forced to take down everything that we don't like.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.120]   Hello people.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.200]   Can we spell free speech anymore?
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.440]   We get the internet we deserve and it's rapidly looking like it's not going to be a very good
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.440]   one.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.600]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.880]   It's the change log, Gina Trepeney.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.720]   You're going to have to go to work.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.560]   You lazy person you.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.760]   I got to take a break.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.760]   Hi everyone.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.960]   Just chilling and I just want to watch.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.560]   By the way, I could point my Amazon phone at your painting and I know exactly who painted
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.560]   it.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.240]   Like that.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.320]   If it works, it's true.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.080]   Wouldn't that be wild if it did?
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.560]   It would be pretty great.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.920]   I think this is like a local Brooklyn artist.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.880]   So I'd be curious to know actually if it would work.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.760]   We're going to talk about squarespace.com.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.640]   A better web awaits at the fabulous squarespace.com.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:17.080]   It's the best web hosting ever plus a fabulous content management system that means you're
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.120]   going to get an incredible website, whether you're a photographer.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:26.560]   By the way, they invented, I should go back and show you, they invented exactly what Amazon
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.400]   just put in their phone, this idea of dynamic perspective.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:33.920]   If you go to the squarespace site and you move your mouse around, you notice the background
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.480]   moves or the foreground doesn't.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.400]   You see, it's just that easy.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.760]   You can even do it in the web with a little HTML5.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.520]   All you have to do is go to squarespace.com after you've played with that for a little bit
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.720]   and click the get started button.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.920]   25 gorgeous templates.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.680]   All of which are mobile responsive.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.320]   They all use the latest and greatest technology, web technology.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.160]   Let me pick one here.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.400]   Momentum, this is a full bleed, very visual.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.040]   And I notice this is the trend now with sites, modern sites, big pictures, and then you scroll
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:09.440]   down and you can see some people who've used this template and of course each is unique.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.280]   And some of them are commerce like the Portland Press that's using squarespace.com to sell.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.920]   It looks like some coffee stuff.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.920]   Or what is that?
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   What is that?
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.920]   Oh, it's a gallery.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.840]   I don't know what this is.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.440]   It's actually kind of fun to go to the websites and see what the different stuff is.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   Oh, yeah, they sell like these pictures.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:41.120]   It's made out of wood, wool, and steel only in Portland.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.080]   Would you make a coffee maker out of wool?
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   An Amason jar.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   An Amason jar.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   This is very Oregonian.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.720]   But that's a squarespace site.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.880]   Here you can create your site.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.720]   All they want, your name, your email, and a password for your site.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.480]   For two weeks you've got the run of the place.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.120]   You can do all sorts of cool stuff with it.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   Play with those templates.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   And you know what?
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.240]   If you decide I don't like this template, you can even import all the content from your
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   existing site.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.480]   If you don't like the template, change it.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.040]   And all the content stays there.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.360]   It just looks different.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.720]   Even pictures, everything, it's all mobile responsive.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.320]   It's great no matter what size screen.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.120]   They all have commerce, e-commerce built in.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.640]   If you want to sell something or take donations or do a wedding registry, you can do that.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.360]   The mobile apps are spectacular.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.760]   The blog app, which lets you post on your squarespace site and moderate comments.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:35.560]   The metrics app, which is a very nice way of measuring not only analytics like how many
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.800]   people visit your page, but also track social followers and so forth.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.000]   They've got some other stuff to the portfolio that synchronizes with the galleries on your
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   squarespace website.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   This is really cool.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   You put this on the iPad.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.480]   If you're a photographer, you've got a squarespace site.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.840]   And the portfolios on your squarespace site are now beautifully displayed on your iPad.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   And this is free.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.360]   This is part of the deal.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.520]   I just love squarespace.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.360]   I want you to, and by the way, yes, Android apps are coming soon.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.720]   They really are good.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.120]   And the price is right.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.640]   They start as low as $8 a month.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.480]   And you buy an annual plan that includes the domain name.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.080]   They'll do the registration for you and hook it all up.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.080]   You want e-commerce.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.800]   They've got the best e-commerce solution out there, just 24 bucks a month.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.480]   They'll help you get set up with credit cards.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.160]   You can have shipping information, shipping calculations on your site, label printing
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.600]   via a ship station, integrated accountings by zero.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.280]   So you get inventory controls and all of that.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.200]   By the way, if you are a competent web developer, you can, of course, use a developer platform
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   to do anything, but you don't need to be.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.440]   And that's the beauty of it.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   $8 a month.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   Get started right now.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:47.400]   And if you decide after your two-week free trial, you want to buy, do all I ask is you
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:56.640]   use the offer code TWIG and you'll get 10% off on your new account, squarespace.com.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.240]   Thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.120]   And now, play the drum slowly.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.720]   It's time for the change log.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:13.760]   Here's Gina, Japan with the latest.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.640]   It's the lull before the I/O storm.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   So this change log is relatively short.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.000]   We've got a couple of things.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.640]   Google Knowledge Graph adds phone numbers with hangout integration to your search results.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.720]   So if you search for your local restaurant, a bar, a business, Google will show you in
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.920]   the Knowledge Graph the top of your search results, a big phone number, you click on
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.160]   it and it'll initialize a call via hangouts.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.760]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.000]   I tried it with a couple of pretty famous restaurants here in New York City.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.840]   It didn't always work.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.840]   Sometimes it happened.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.480]   I got the listing in the Knowledge Graph on the right side and the number there was
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.200]   clickable.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.000]   But really nice if you want to make a reservation or ask if, you know, what time they're open.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.200]   Kind of nice hookup.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.800]   And I hope that this means that at I/O we're going to hear a little bit more about hangouts
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:04.160]   and voice and kind of really unifying all the messaging apps together.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.320]   Ways got an update.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   I thought this would make Jeff's definitely happy.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.320]   I love this one.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.760]   Ways is updated for Android and iOS, the mobile apps with the new UI and enhanced location sharing
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.760]   features.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:20.720]   So the new ways update it now syncs your phone's contact lists with your ways friends.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.760]   And now you can share your driving routes with multiple friends at a time.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.200]   And the people that you share your drive with can track your progress and will be provided
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.480]   with a real time ETA, which probably used this next week when we're driving up to Petaluma
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.280]   to do to do to do to really be helpful.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   Last one.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.440]   Don't forget to get an ad in the time for me getting out of the car and puking for you
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   on the bridge.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.440]   No.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.440]   Come on.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:52.520]   We have to get ways to send, you know, scared emoticons when we're on the bridge.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:57.720]   Google account, your Google account settings area has a new section called Google account
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.720]   history.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.760]   So if you go to Google.com slash settings slash account history or just click on the
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:08.080]   account history tab, you'll be able to kind of control your history tracking.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.400]   So you can pause.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.200]   It's interesting that they call it pause.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.880]   You can pause your search history tracking, location history tracking and your YouTube history
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.200]   of things that you've watched, you haven't.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.160]   And what's neat about this doesn't sound like much, right?
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.040]   But what's neat about this new tab is that this page, first of all, is beautifully designed.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.680]   And when you do click pause, you get a little pop out of it, graze out the thing and you
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.200]   get a little pop up saying, hey, if you, you know, if you pause your say search history
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.160]   tracking, Google now is going to be a lot less useful.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.240]   You know, these are some of the features that you'll be missing.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   And I really like that.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.600]   So I feel like Google does not only needs to give users the ability to control what information
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.200]   Google logs and shares across apps like now to Gmail, to calendar, etc.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.160]   But I think it's a really good way to communicate like, hey, you know, this is what you get.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.880]   Google now is this smart because this is on.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.000]   And if it's off, then these are the features that you won't get.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.360]   I also think it's interesting that pause was the word that they chose instead of stop
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.760]   or don't do this, you know, because pause implies that you're going to start it again,
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   right?
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.560]   So it's like gentle coercion.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.160]   We're just pausing, but we're not stopping.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.480]   Yeah, just pausing for now.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.560]   But this is the kind of thing I'd love to see for Android out permissions, right?
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.080]   Like this is like, you know, which are long and complex and complicated.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.840]   I just would love to see like, hey, if I revoke this one permission or if I, you know, you
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.360]   want this one permission for what reasons, what features aren't I going to get?
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   Anyway, that's, that's all I got for today for the change log next week.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   The entire episode is going to be a change log.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   I'm very excited.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.600]   Ooh, can't wait.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.520]   That's the change log.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.600]   Thank you, Gina, Shabani.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   Sure.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   Thank you.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:59.440]   Just do a couple other stories because I want to get you out of here for bedtime.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.560]   Adobe at the same time as Amazon was having its event, Adobe had an event call to upgrade
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.960]   the creative cloud.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.360]   I don't know if there are a lot of big stories out of that.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:15.400]   They are going to continue a promotion that I've took advantage of that lets you get for,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.080]   as a photographer, $10 a month access to Lightroom and Photoshop.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.400]   The two things photographers use the most.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.520]   I got that as an upgradeer to from an earlier version or something, but now they're going
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.280]   to make that permanent.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:34.880]   If you have never had a Photoshop license, $10 a month, you get a Lightroom and Photoshop.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:40.320]   Adding some features to the iPad app for Lightroom, which is really a spectacular app and a very
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.600]   nice Adjunct if you use Lightroom on the desktop.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.800]   They've added some new apps, Inc. and Slide.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   Are those apps or, those are actual physical pen and a ruler?
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:50:00.080]   Well, there's a physical pen that's pressure sensitive and does neat stuff.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.560]   Then the neat thing about the ruler is when you set it down and then you just draw next
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.080]   to it, it'll draw the line where it shows you're drawing the line so you could use it for
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   more drafting kinds of things.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   Wow.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   Pretty cool.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.640]   It's pretty cool.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.520]   What's really interesting is it's 200 bucks.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.520]   Wow.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.960]   Still not just seeing Pogue on Yahoo Tech.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.320]   Yeah, David Pogue is weird.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.800]   Yeah, I know.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   It's weird.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:33.400]   Is Lightroom, so when you're like a real photographer, is Lightroom the sort of?
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   Yes.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   Accepted app.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   Real for not a little.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.040]   For a while, Apple had a strong competitor with Aperture, but they haven't updated it
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.040]   in years.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.280]   I think most people use Lightroom.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.680]   It's Apple or Windows.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.680]   That's great.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.520]   If you take a lot of pictures, Lightroom is fabulous, but you probably also use Photoshop.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.440]   If you use Lightroom, you probably want to use the iPad app as well because it allows
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.560]   you to preview your stuff.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.560]   They've added now the ability to rank photos and all sorts of stuff and it syncs up.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.560]   There it is.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.560]   That's the pen, which is just a stylus.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.080]   Traditional stylus is the ruler that's interesting.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.720]   Then you have a new app called, or two new apps called Sketch and Line.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   All right.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   Very nice.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.720]   David's getting a demonstration.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.280]   She draw directly onto the iPad.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   So weird.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.520]   I just don't.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.520]   Okay.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   What we realized was it's digital, so it can do a lot more.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.640]   If we just have a single button on here, we can choose different shapes.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.400]   You see if I click this button, I can switch to a circle.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.240]   It's just going to scratch your screen up like crazy.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.720]   And each of those can be manipulated.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   It's not.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.720]   I don't like it.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.920]   I don't get it.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   Just use it.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:45.920]   Look at that.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.560]   You can be really all kinds of exactly.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.560]   I guess.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560]   I guess.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.560]   So architects use iPads to...
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   Well, not to point.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.560]   We could actually...
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.560]   Who knows?
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.480]   This is how my kit is going to draw.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.480]   I hope not.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.000]   By the way, iOS only, there's no Android.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.640]   There's no Android which pisses me off now.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.080]   There is a root for the Galaxy S5.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.400]   Thank you, GeoHot.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   And that GeoHot's good.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.680]   He's released a root tool that's not only the S5, which has been very difficult to root,
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.000]   including the AT&T and Verizon versions of the S5.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:28.960]   The XDA members took up a collection for a GeoHot of over $18,000.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.120]   Once he got the money, he created towel root.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:38.720]   I like the buttons, make it rain and lead.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.640]   If you're running 442 or earlier, you can root with that method, including...
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.560]   I'll test it because I have an S4 that I've never been able to root.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:52.320]   It's the unlocked S4 using a Samsung processor, which Samsung's managed to lock down pretty
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   well.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:53:00.080]   It's based, as all of these root solutions are, on a kernel vulnerability, Pinkie Pie,
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.680]   the well-known hacker Pinkie Pie discovered that one.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.920]   So that's the problem is, of course, they're going to immediately...
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:15.120]   Now that they know there's a vulnerability, fix it, which means towel won't work anymore.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:22.080]   But I do think Google has always said it's...
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.160]   You should be able to have the right to root your phone.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:29.040]   It's the carriers and manufacturers who've thwarted people.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   Here's a convenience.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:34.840]   There's a new smartphone out of China that comes with a malware pre-installed, saving
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.840]   you time and trouble.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:42.240]   Also, the convenient feature, it won't download updates to the security, which is convenient.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.800]   Simple, simplified your life.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.480]   It's got a spy function on it.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.680]   It's invisible to the user.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.520]   Cannot be deactivated.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:55.320]   And well, maybe they're selling this to Jealous Husbands.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.160]   Here's a...
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.160]   Because we have seen these before phones that have this built-in spy capability.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.200]   LG says, "No, we're not.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.000]   Google hasn't contacted us about building an Nexus phone."
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.960]   So LG, which built the last two Nexus phones, the 5, 4, and 5, apparently not working on
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.400]   any new phones.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   Is there a new Nexus?
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.400]   That's the big question.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.040]   That's the question, right?
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.440]   Is there a new Nexus at all?
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.440]   Maybe not.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.760]   I don't know.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   I hope so.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.320]   Well, isn't that the rumor we heard that there wouldn't be?
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.120]   And then everybody said no.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.120]   So...
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.120]   Andrew Silver.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.920]   Matt Cutts said no.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.520]   They're looking at Nexus.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   Right.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.600]   That's not exactly, but that's what he strongly implied that you didn't think.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.600]   I want a new Nexus.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   I'm ready for a new Nexus.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   I like this one.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   This is wonderful.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.760]   I don't know if I believe this story.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.400]   I'm going to take this with a grain of salt.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.400]   This comes from a site called Social News Daily.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.920]   And they are alleging...
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:55:04.680]   Well, first of all, that the rumor is true that YouTube is going to launch a music service,
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.960]   kind of like Spotify or RDO.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.920]   Ad supported free streaming music, paid tier on top without ads and offline streaming.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:16.040]   Google already does this with Google Music, I might add, but I guess you get video.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:20.960]   But according to the Financial Times, about 10% of the music industry has not yet agreed
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.880]   to the terms of the new YouTube service.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:29.240]   Many of them are indie labels like Excel Recording, whose artists included Dell and the
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:35.320]   XX Domino, who represents the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.640]   It's over money, obviously.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.120]   But this is the thing I'm not sure I buy.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.800]   According to Social News Daily, YouTube will begin blocking videos from indie musicians
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.880]   on those labels.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.320]   If your label does not agree to terms for the YouTube music service, according to this
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.040]   article, Google's going to not let you upload videos at all.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   Is that possible?
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.040]   I wanted you to explain this one to me.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.040]   I think this is false.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.720]   I think this is just bogus.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.920]   But the story is spread like crazy.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:08.800]   It seems to me Google would have a huge problem if it did that.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:09.800]   I think so too.
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   It sounds highly anti-kindle.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.280]   Well, I've got this.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:17.320]   The Guardian says, "The company's head of content and business operation, Robert Kinsell."
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   Kinsell?
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.320]   Kinsell.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.480]   "Told the Financial Times that the service previously rumored to be called YouTube Music
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   Pass will launch more widely later in the year.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:28.320]   His confirmation that YouTube will block videos from artists from labels."
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.320]   Kinsell said this.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.840]   "That do not sign licensing deals for the new premium tier will be hugely controversial
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:39.000]   among indie labels with trade body WIN already filing a complaint to the European Commission."
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   Maybe it is true.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.080]   But it could be that they are going to block them from the service, but not from uploading
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.080]   to YouTube anywhere.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.920]   I think they block them from YouTube everywhere.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.440]   I think they are going to have a lack of trouble.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.240]   While we wish we had 100% success rate, we understand that it is not likely an achievable
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.440]   goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:07.520]   enhanced music experience," said Kinsell, claiming that YouTube has signed up labels
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.760]   representing 90% of the music industry.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.760]   Wow.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.560]   Well, we will watch that with interest.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.760]   I find that hard to believe.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.880]   If they do do that, it is not just going to be the EU that slaps them around.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.400]   Yeah, because this is, it just doesn't make sense.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.400]   It just doesn't.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.320]   And there are people like Adele, Arctic Monkeys and Jack White who are independent labels.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:30.720]   I think it is probably a misinterpretation that he will block them from the service,
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:35.320]   but the implication is that Adele would no longer be able to upload a music video to
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.320]   YouTube.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.920]   I can't because I can upload a music video.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   Right.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   Well, we will see.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:41.920]   Yeah, you are right.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.040]   Because anybody can, I can upload a music video.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   I can say, "Hello, hallelujah."
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.680]   And I make a music video, right?
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   And I put it up there.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.600]   "What's to stop anyone else including Adele from doing justice?"
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:58:02.360]   What it would come down to is if Google had a sufficient size for this to be a monopoly
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.840]   issue, a restraint of trade issue.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.320]   If Google can effectively say, "Well, there's 800 other services they can upload it to,
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   we just don't want them on ours."
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.640]   I guess they could do that.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.480]   I think Google is at this point big enough.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.920]   YouTube is at this point big enough that maybe not in Europe, but certainly in the
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.960]   US, that would be restraint of trade, I think.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:28.920]   Here's another one that I don't know what to say about this.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.360]   This is a, I guess the best thing to do would be warn people about it.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.160]   This is a Kickstarter project called I Find.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.760]   It's an item location tag.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.960]   They went up a few weeks ago.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   They asked for $25,000.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.760]   They've raised nearly half a million dollars well over their goal.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.560]   As far, and I'd love to hear from somebody, but as far as I can tell, there's no way this
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.120]   could physically work.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:56.680]   It is a battery free location tag.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:02.200]   They claim that they'll be gathering energy through the air and storing it.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.880]   There's no battery.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:08.280]   It recycles, this is the text on the page at Kickstarter.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:13.480]   It recycles electromagnetic energy and stores it in a unique power bank.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.920]   This is the one that certainly has been going crazy on.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:22.160]   This exciting feature frees you from the trouble of charging batteries or replacing them through
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   the manufacturer.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.160]   I don't think that's physically possible.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:32.040]   I mean, there is RFID, but that wouldn't help you if you lost your keys.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:35.960]   It says, "Sync the tag to your phone and you're all set."
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.560]   The thing is they've raised a lot of money.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:42.240]   Now, I thought Kickstarter had precautions against this kind of thing.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:46.520]   In fact, I know one of the things Kickstarter requires is a physical prototype.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:49.400]   There is non-visible.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:59.240]   The president of this company, a previous job, was selling herbal supplements.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.360]   They've been very unresponsive in the Q&A's.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.920]   The thing that really bugs me is this.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.600]   Look at this paragraph under risks and challenges.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:12.440]   A short paragraph says, "The main risk is our reliance on outside sources within the
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440]   supply chain.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.520]   If they can't give us these circuits, they don't mention the fact that this is physical
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.200]   impossibility.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.360]   That would seem to be a risk."
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.520]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.200]   We're not sure if this will work.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   I'm a prototype.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.080]   We've got a very nice video.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.720]   I'm a patron of a Kickstarter to have a perpetual lotion machine.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720]   What do you mean, Leo?
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.360]   If you participate in this, I just buyer beware.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:51.560]   It seems to me unlikely that there is such a thing as a batteryless item location tag.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.360]   But maybe they've got one.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.200]   They've not been very responsive in the comments.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.880]   There's a lot of people in the comments who say, "Hey, how does this blah, blah, blah,
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.040]   blah?"
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.040]   Just a word of warning.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.440]   I think maybe a little bit of due diligence on the part of Kickstarter might be indicated
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.840]   at this point.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.760]   What is their responsibility on this?
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.920]   I can't find the story where Pandora's gone.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920]   Pandora.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   No, not Pandora.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   Pandora Daily.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   Pandora Daily.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   Pandora Daily.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   Pandora Daily.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   Jesus, idiot Jarvis.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:25.160]   If you just look in the comments, you'll see quite a few people who are saying, "Well,
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.160]   what?"
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.640]   I don't think Kickstarter, I don't think that they review any of it.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.200]   I mean, they certainly don't review.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   Well, they reject it.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.200]   They do that.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   That's true.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.200]   They reject projects sometimes.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.200]   Right.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200]   Right.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.760]   And a lot of people say, "Hey, I have complained to Kickstarter.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.240]   I've flagged this, but Kickstarter has left it up.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.280]   Remember Kickstarter makes a percentage of that $480,000."
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   Right.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.040]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.160]   Is it possible?
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.360]   It seems unlikely that this is a real thing.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360]   But there you go.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.760]   I just a word of warning, and I'll keep looking into it.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.320]   And yeah, Pandora Daily has raised a stink on this.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.280]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.000]   Our tool, our tip, our number of the week, Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Leo Laporta.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.720]   I showed today brought to you by our great friends at 99designs.com.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.120]   If you want to know more, this is a community of over 300,000 designers who are sitting
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:30.240]   there waiting for you to go to 99designs.com and create a design contest.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.560]   You need a logo for your business.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.120]   Do you need a new website?
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.440]   Do you need a landing page for your Facebook?
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.720]   Menus, car wraps, business cards?
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:45.880]   You can get a great designer at 99designs to give you some great designs.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.800]   In fact, the way it works, and I love this is you'll set up a design contest, and then
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.320]   designers will go to the contest and will submit suggestions.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.760]   You can work with them a little bit to refine it.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:05.120]   You pick the best design and you get a great design for a very reasonable price.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.720]   It's also a great way to kind of improve your website.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.880]   To find out if your website design is really good UI.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.720]   No, people shouldn't be doing their own design.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.280]   If you're not a designer, you should not be doing it.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:24.400]   To date, there have been 310,000 contests and $77 million paid out last month, $2.2 million
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.400]   alone.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.720]   That's a big jump from the month before.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:31.000]   I think they doubled the amount of payouts since last month.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:39.160]   Go to the website, 99designs.com/twig, and you'll get a $99 power pack of savings absolutely
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.480]   free just because you heard about it on this week in Google.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480]   What is the power pack?
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.800]   To get more designer time and attention, they'll bold and highlight and feature your design
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   project.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.400]   In 99designs marketplace, you'll get nearly twice as many designs.

[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   Very affordable.

[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:17.200]   package, including business cards and stationery and all of that.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.600]   I think that's a great deal.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:28.440]   99designs.com/twig, Gina Trapani's tip of the week.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:34.520]   Google is showing step-by-step instructions in search results right now, which is kind
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520]   of interesting.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.960]   Eating life hackers lungs a little bit.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:44.560]   If you search for something like iCOD restore or how to poach an egg in the knowledge graph,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.840]   Google will actually show step-by-step instructions.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.880]   You can also do this for Google related questions.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:57.360]   If you Google Gmail export contacts, you'll see step-by-step instructions.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:04.160]   Yeah, for something like iCOD restore, where it's clearly a step-by-step instructions from
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:13.200]   the Apple support pages, they must be parsing the markup and figuring out, as far as I
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.480]   know, there aren't semantic tags for step-by-step instructions.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.680]   Google is pretty good job.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.760]   They give an example.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.920]   What is the distance to Mars?
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.600]   They say sometimes we're close to Mars.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600]   Other times we're distance.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.760]   The minimum distance is this.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.520]   So there's even teaching here.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.120]   I just really like that.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.320]   That's really great.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.160]   This is like, well, you know, I got to figure kids nowadays when they're doing their homework
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.160]   do Google searches.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.680]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.520]   Chris says, yep.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.640]   What year are you?
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.120]   You're a junior?
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.480]   He's a rising junior, high school junior.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.080]   He says, when I said kids today, you do Google searches.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.080]   He raised his thumb.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   Thumbs up.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.080]   Yes.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.080]   How to take a screenshot.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.080]   This is great.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.000]   Now, it looks like there's iMOR.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.200]   It looks like they're actually, there must be.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.840]   So there's no semantic markup for these are instructions.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840]   Not that I'm aware of.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.840]   I don't believe so.
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.840]   They must understand it somehow.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:16.800]   I mean, maybe they're just looking for, you know, OLIs ordered lists.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.760]   I don't know how they're doing it, but it's pretty cool.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:22.480]   And I tried to try to view that I would think I would have thought had would have had answers
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.480]   and don't.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.480]   Maybe they whitelisted sites.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.080]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.080]   But pretty nice.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.640]   How to cook fluffy, tasty quinoa.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.800]   Well, man, that's good.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   That's a good search.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800]   How do you cook quinoa?
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.400]   Chad, do you really want to know that?
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   What?
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.400]   And how do you get a date?
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.400]   How do you get a date?
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.400]   How do you pronounce quinoa?
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.000]   Yeah, that's that's it.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Okay.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Here's how to get a date.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Oh, no.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   Nothing.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   They gives you 10 dating sites.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.800]   Well, there's some things that you just don't want to touch.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.600]   I'm surprised that they don't take wiki how and show that.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.320]   How to get a wife and had a good at a have a good life.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   That is from what you have.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.560]   Man, they didn't give me the step by step.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.120]   I needed all the spelled out.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.120]   Is it wiki?
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   How do you?
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.320]   How do you get a joke?

[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   Wiki.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.920]   Kind of sort of.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.080]   But they don't they don't look at the search results.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.680]   They want everyone to just commit contribute everything.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   Yeah, because it's a wiki.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680]   All right.

[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.040]   It was great.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.040]   It was in our it was in our rundown.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040]   I didn't get around to it.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040]   I know it's okay.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040]   I just wanted to mention it.

[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   No, because he's Polish.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.760]   So it's okay.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.160]   The loud to air loud to so I guess I'll use this number.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.920]   Garmin remember them slightly disrupted company.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.640]   They've released a dollar 99 navigation app.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.000]   Oh, until now, kind of used to be a hundred bucks, didn't it?
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.600]   Slightly disrupted.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.600]   Whoops.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.760]   Now you get the encyclopedia for 55 cents in a box.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.880]   And they still charge you more if you want live traffic.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.680]   Well, hello, man.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.040]   What you know, raise.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.560]   Yeah, I don't you know there's a free solution.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:52.040]   Oh, I do think the Google Maps, I use Google Maps for navigation and we had talked about
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:56.520]   the change log how they now give you better information about when you're getting off,
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.440]   you know, taking an exit and stuff like that.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.800]   So the turn by turn is so much better than Garmin's ever was.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   Isn't it great?
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   What lane you're supposed to be in.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:08.200]   Yeah, you're going to take the two left lanes, you know, both of them turn off.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.200]   It's just so much better.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.720]   It'll even say seconds from the right or second from the left.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.600]   I was driving down San Francisco and save my butt.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.120]   Yeah, because it said you normally says turn left.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.680]   It says does it second from the left, right?
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.000]   Because it put me in the perfect lane to change under the next street I had to take.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   It's amazing.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.320]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.320]   So your number is a buck 99.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   What did I know?
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320]   That's my number.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.320]   You almost pity.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.200]   You almost pity you Garmin on this phone.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   You do.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.360]   It's still $2 too expensive.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.360]   Exactly.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.200]   There was there was a Jill Lepore, I think your name is.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   Yeah, and then Leoper.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:55.320]   So this smash on Clay Christensen disruption and just cut apart as a tariff rate of disruption.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.320]   And Mark Ederson has come back and answered it really well, I think.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.480]   Why don't I start on that?
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.640]   We've had Clay Christensen on the triangulation, actually.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.880]   We talked about that.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880]   Oh, really?
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880]   So my device is this.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.040]   It is the Galaxy Gear 2.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.520]   I was talking about it earlier.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.000]   I have a very attractive clock face on it, which makes it a little bit more palatable.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   It is touch.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   You can talk to it.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.720]   You can do S voice.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.280]   You can send texts by talking to it.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.520]   It does exercise heart rate monitoring.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.520]   Heart rate from watch without the chest.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   Without the chest thing?
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520]   It's got a little.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.520]   That's a deal.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.600]   I have a couple of watches that do that.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.720]   It's got a little camera in the back.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.720]   I don't know.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.640]   You can't really see it, but there's a little meter in there.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.640]   You have to sit still.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.440]   It doesn't do it while you're running.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.640]   Oh, that's probably it.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.640]   What good is that?
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.560]   You've simplified, you know, there used to be the camera was a little pimple on the
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.560]   band.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.760]   Now it's nicely recessed into the bezel.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.000]   You can dial the phone direct from it and you can even talk into it and, you know, do
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   a dick trace.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.360]   You hold it up to your ear.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.720]   So, but that's the good stuff.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.880]   The negative is $300.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.600]   It only works with Samsung Galaxy devices.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.080]   I had to run out and find my Note 3, which I buried in our pile of stuff so I could set
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080]   it up.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.680]   I'll give a full review of them before you buy next Tuesday, but I just feel like this
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.000]   is such a crowded category.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.400]   I'm really, this is nice.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   It does.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.400]   It's nice.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.440]   It's okay, but it's not.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440]   Is there any?
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.120]   So, let's say Google has a watch.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.280]   What's your dream watch?
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.840]   You know, I'm looking at that Moto 360.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:37.360]   I like the round face, but it looks really thick.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.160]   We all saw the Daily Show's mocking of the Google Glass Explorers.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.880]   And the reporter kept saying, you know, you could just pull the phone out of your pocket
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   and look at it.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   I don't.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.560]   Why do you need to wear that on your head?
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.640]   What did you think of that, Jeff?
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   Did you?
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.120]   I thought it was just old jokes.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.240]   I think, you know, they split.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240]   But they're right.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.920]   They're right for mochage.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.720]   They are, they are, and they were too serious.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.120]   And that's what they wanted.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.880]   They knew the guys, one of the guys said, hey, you know, the guy who got his glass stolen
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.120]   in the Mission District, he said, hey, I knew what I was in for.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120]   They kind of told us.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.840]   They interviewed us for two and a half hours, showed like 30 seconds of us.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.840]   What the heck?
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.840]   It was funny.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.840]   It was funny.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:33.560]   I invented a better comic moment of the week, I think, was the FCC Chairman Anserine, John
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.560]   Oliver and John Oliver, answering in return.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560]   The Dingo.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560]   Have you seen this?
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:45.280]   No, because John Oliver did a fabulous discussion of net neutrality in which he likened having
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.040]   Tom Wheeler and the FCC regulate the cable industry, likened it to having a Dingo watch
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.040]   your baby.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   Right.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:58.660]   So Chad, if you would search for John Oliver FCC Dingo, there we go.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.320]   So, okay, at least this is, this is, this is, this is, and bonded a couple of weeks ago,
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.800]   we did a piece about net neutrality.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.320]   And there was a moment in it where we pointed out that Tom Wheeler, the chair of the FCC,
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:16.440]   which is tasked with regulating cable companies, was previously a lobbyist for the cable industry.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.520]   Something of a conflict of interest that we summarised thusly.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.640]   That is the equivalent of needing a babysitter and hiring a Dingo.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:31.320]   But, sure, it's a little offensive to Australia's favourite baby-eating animal, but needs much
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320]   for the job.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.720]   And you're probably wondering why I'm playing it again now.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.880]   Well, on Friday, the FCC held an open meeting and this happened.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.600]   I'm just wondering if you watched the John Oliver segment about net neutrality and what
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.360]   you thought it had.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.360]   Oh.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360]   Oh.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   Oh.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   He said, "Snack."
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   Right?
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.960]   Yeah, he could do pretty well.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.720]   So, what did he think?
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:09.120]   I think that it represents the high level of interest that exists in the topic in the
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.440]   country.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.440]   And that's good.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.800]   It's good.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800]   I am not a Dingo.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   Right.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800]   You're going.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:25.040]   I mean, I would like to state for the record that I'm not a Dingo.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:31.320]   He actually said it.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   First.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.320]   First.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   Wow.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.520]   And second, we never said you were a Dingo.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.920]   They said you were like a Dingo.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.920]   Similarly.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.600]   Now, you're denying it so strenuously, I'm honestly starting to wonder whether you are
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.680]   actually a Dingo after all.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.080]   He even tried to throw us off the scent by pretending not to know what a Dingo even
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.080]   is.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.320]   I had to go look it up.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.600]   It's a feral wild animal, or that story.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.320]   He's the big.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.960]   That's exactly the kind of thing a Dingo would say if you didn't want anyone to know
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.960]   he was a Dingo.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.440]   I mean, just look at a split screen right now.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.240]   The wellness is uncanny.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.680]   Think about it.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:21.280]   If you shave the one on the left, would it not look a little like the guy on the right?
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.720]   Because now I have lots more questions, Wheeler, such as, "Have you at any time ever consumed
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.760]   a swamp wallaby for its nutrients?"
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.480]   You probably have your dingo.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.320]   What's your answer to that?
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.120]   I'm not a Dingo.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.080]   You keep saying that.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.440]   Now the burden of proof is on you unless you can produce an official document.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.440]   Verifical, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:51.080]   You are in fact not a 100% talking Dingo.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:56.080]   I don't think you can complain if Americans refuse to leave you alone in range with their
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.080]   babies.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:03.120]   You got to go back and see the full net neutrality clip because it is probably the best description
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.640]   of why we're worried about the FCC.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.800]   I should mention that Patrick Leahy has come back and proposed a bill that would prohibit
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.400]   fast lane prioritization.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:19.000]   Chances of passing, God knows, but at least we have legislation on to push it.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.080]   And I want a t-shirt Leo that says, "A Dingo ate my internet."
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.440]   Dingo, like my bandwidth.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this edition of this week in Google.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.800]   That is Jeff Jarvis, who is at the City University of New York.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:38.080]   He is a professor of journalism there, very prestigious, very highly esteemed, also the
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.960]   author of Public Parts and a World Traveler.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.880]   He will be here next week doing twig.
