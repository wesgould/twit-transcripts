[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.800]   He's the king of media of all media.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   Take that Howard Stern.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.080]   Oh no no no no no no no no no.

[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   Nice to see you in up and see a boss is it snowy are you you're in just in the Ontario
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.840]   right you're not up in Toronto yet you're in Toronto.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.400]   You got a little dusting of snow but not much.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   Not yet.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.200]   Toronto is funny because you get the lake effect but the opposite of what Chicago gets.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.600]   You get you get warm air from the lake.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.320]   Yeah it can be good and bad.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   It means more snow.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.920]   You go either way.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   Alright.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.800]   Diagra fall.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.080]   So I have to we are tomorrow's Thanksgiving in the US you've already had yours.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.280]   So how was it?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280]   It was good.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   Oh good.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.680]   Alright a little preview of the future for us.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.000]   Canadian celebrated months early.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640]   Is there a traditional food that's different?
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.480]   I mean do you do those stupid you know fries and gravy thing and thanksgiving or what do
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   you do?
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.640]   No it's it's pretty standard.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.840]   I mean you mean poutine for Thanksgiving?
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.800]   No that would be good actually I love poutine.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   It's got great.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.540]   But you know turkey stuffing gravy mashed potatoes you know some people like Brussels
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.760]   spreads stuff like that.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.320]   Is there a ceremonial Canadian apology to the turkey?
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320]   Not usually.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.000]   I'm sorry turkey.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I'm doing turkey.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.720]   I'm doing turkey and ham, Parker house rolls mashed potatoes green beans, pumpkin pie.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.920]   You're doing ham nice.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.040]   Yeah well Michael wanted ham it's his birthday of all things.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.520]   He's 13 so he gets to choose.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   And sometimes we'll do like ham one day of the weekend or or lamb and then turkey.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   Lamb is great but yeah yeah.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.720]   So we we reserve lamb for Easter here in the southern forty nine.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.120]   Yeah we often do that as well.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.160]   So one of the traditions on Thanksgiving is a link baby think piece on how to deal with
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   your racist relatives.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.640]   And I am now a new fan and I know you guys will know and I just didn't know of Jeb Lund
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.200]   who writes I guess for the Guardian you know him?
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   Of him?
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   I've heard of him.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   Oh man he's good.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:56.160]   So he's he's going to take the you know the role of the a Serbic pundit who has a master
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.200]   of the turn of phrase.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.560]   He writes in the Rolling Stone tips for dealing with fake racist uncle think pieces this Thanksgiving.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.120]   It's a masterpiece.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.600]   Instead of arguing with the relatives pick a fight that deserves winning a fight over
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.680]   fried turkeys.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.600]   You can measure he writes the cultural change by the straw men we used to complain about
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.840]   it.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.400]   The eighties and nineties what is the deal with airline food disappeared along with the
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.800]   airline food itself and evolved into everyone having some stick about taking their shoes
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.600]   off of the security line or seeing their MacBook crushed by a reclining seat.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.360]   Aiming for the fattest targets the complaints always miss the right ones veering hackily
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   away from the real enemy.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.200]   You can see the same thing at work with Thanksgiving.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:49.240]   Of course we've all seen a huge number of pieces on how to argue with your your relatives
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.360]   this Thanksgiving.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.680]   He says for much of the 2000s you could have joined a kind of generalized complaint about
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.360]   how much Thanksgiving sucks which was hackneyed the moment it began.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.320]   Mostly this took the form of assignment padding pieces penned 30 minutes before vacation time
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.800]   saying why having to use a rental car and go to a suburb of 80,000 people to eat 12
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.000]   pounds of food with my mom is basically a trail of tears.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.560]   The underlying tone was a great derisive snorting about the provincialism to which the writer
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.680]   was about to be subject to convey the sense that the worst part of Thanksgiving was being
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.920]   forced to return to the thing that had been escaped and they could in no way define the
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.880]   writer who is now a being from a brighter place.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.760]   So I agree I've seen a lot of up worthy headlines about your relatives.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.640]   He says it's ridiculous to assume even if you disagree that you're going to have three
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.400]   bullet points from an article that's going to change everybody's point of view.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.880]   And ask people click.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.280]   Actually I've avoided I've been I'm proud of myself I'm like intense intentionally like
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   grit my teeth and go I will not click that.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:11.680]   Anyway I just if you have and then it caused me to read some more Jeb Lund some of it's
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:19.200]   in the Guardian but I think he's an American and is very funny so recommended as an antidote
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.400]   and he does say by the way the real enemy is taking a perfectly nice turkey and putting
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.680]   it in a what does he call it?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.880]   I'm going to find it is at the bottom of the piece.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.520]   Red turkey is a goddamn travesty.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.680]   It's only as flavorful as the surface meat and skin the rest is just wet inside.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.840]   To make it taste like anything other than hot neutral turkey meat means you're lying on
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.480]   a gravy vector that can't be improved by turkey drippings because you threw the whole effort
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.000]   into a cardiac drowning pool.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.320]   What you get is a moist bird.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.680]   That's nice if you're single in London but it's no good on a plate in front of grandma.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.840]   This is the war we should be fighting America.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.480]   It's not as tenditious or upsetting as railing about American history or factory farming
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.920]   or carbon emissions.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.400]   It's not some bass-weagened Dave Barry trying out his shoe bomb material on you before you
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.000]   walk through the extra machine and it's not someone beating the tray table in fury because
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.040]   the workspace in his row is more important than the sleep space in yours and it's sure
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.800]   not some factious exercise by some post-teen keyboard jockey whining about returning to
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.640]   darkest Pennsylvania via the contrived avatar of some relative they probably don't even
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   have.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.840]   This war is winnable and at least it's real.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840]   Okay.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.080]   Actually Darwin is in full force with deep fat frying turkey because it's almost certainly
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.600]   going to cause a column of hot fat and burst into flames.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   We did that one.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:58.680]   Up at our end we had to do a real turkey the regular way as well because the family complained
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.400]   that the deep fry version would not have stuffing and of course stuffing is the whole
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.120]   purpose of having turkey in the first place.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.320]   We did deep fry one, did it out in the driveway just in case.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   Smart.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320]   It actually went pretty well.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   No flames.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   No flames.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.960]   And the turkey, did it taste good?
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   You know what?
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   I was not a fan.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960]   So maybe we did it wrong.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.040]   I think it's just greasy.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.240]   It is faster once you get the oil up to temperature.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.200]   The problem is you got 40 gallons of oil.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.760]   You have to get it up to temperature.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.200]   It takes like a half an hour with all the oil.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   Right.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   Oh, good question.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.840]   Oh, I think there's a toxic dump somewhere in Ontario.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   We, you know, got rid of it discreetly without.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   Okay.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:53.720]   Now we just use the cooker to boil porn.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.880]   It's great for that.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.080]   You make a lot of it too.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.720]   Did you see the Star Wars?
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.200]   I was actually complaining yesterday about the, just the already, even a month before
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.720]   the Star Wars movie comes out, the overwhelming amount of marketing.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.760]   Google has already done several things to participate.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:23.680]   I think you can change your avatar to awaken the force within.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.160]   And if you, they even have a page, Google.com/Star Wars.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.720]   And if you Google, you can have a die fighter as your car.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:43.080]   You can choose your side and your Google apps will either be on the Rebel Alliance or the
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.480]   Imperial forces.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.280]   Just like, I, please.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.400]   But yeah, tell, so the, the one you were going to say, go ahead, Matthew, because I'll do
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   it right now.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.000]   If you, if you Google search a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, long time ago,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.440]   you won't have to type very much because of course, auto complete will do this for you.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.640]   And you get the search results in a, in a crawl suitable for, you know what?
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.880]   Let me turn the audio on too, by the way.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.000]   Oh, I never did that.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.640]   There you go.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   There you go.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   Okay.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.560]   I know it's nerdy, but I do get chills when I hear this music.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.360]   I do, I do get excited when I hear this music.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.280]   Wasn't the first one to come out what year?
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   1977.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.080]   God, we were young.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.040]   A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.240]   And those are live links too.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.200]   This is the actual search results.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.280]   So you could click, you know, click it and get a result.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.280]   Do you see now?
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.640]   Here's the question.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.480]   And we, I debated, we debated as I said, Google for sure got paid for this.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.320]   Yeah, I would bet.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   It's an ad.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   It's an ad.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.040]   Although they do, it's not that different from the Google do.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   Barrel roll and all that.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.240]   Yeah, but it's so, and they, well, they use so much material to the song using the song.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.960]   I'm in trouble, but they're probably had to pay for that.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.960]   They didn't pay for it.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   Oh, but they're paid.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.600]   Somebody else paid for it.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.240]   Oh, they do a barrel.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.920]   I'm happy to see do a barrel roll still works.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   If you search for it.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.920]   Do a barrel roll.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.160]   Oh, you know what?
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.160]   I already did it once.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   I can't.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   I guess you can only do one barrel roll.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   There you go.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   I didn't get that.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   Nice.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.280]   Fun with CSS.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.800]   I have to think Disney gave him a little, little something for it.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   I think they do that anyway.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.080]   Well, they're for sure nerds.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.720]   You know, the kind of nerds who in 1977 were 12 years old and damn excited about the movie
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.000]   everyone was talking about.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.640]   I remember waiting in line to see Star Wars.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.800]   I was 21.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.560]   I saw it on Gary and so was this.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.880]   Yeah, you remember where you saw it, I think.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.480]   What year did it come out?
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   77.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   77.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   77.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   Wow.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   We're all day.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.280]   Well, if you think you're old, take a look at Mark Hamill.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.200]   He is not aging well.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.600]   Well, he had a car wreck or something, right?
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.440]   He did have a car crash.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   Yeah, because Harrison Ford looks great.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   Harrison Ford does look pretty good.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   He's looking fabulous.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   I don't think the...
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   Is that Gary Fisher?
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   So...
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   Oh, there you go.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   You know, people age and...
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   I'm not...
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   I'm one of them.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.280]   If you... I mean, I was 21 when I saw that movie.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.600]   So it was Carrie, I think.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.280]   She was close to it.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.960]   She's had a hard life.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.520]   It's a hard knock light for Leia.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.920]   It's a hard knock life for Leia.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   All right.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.720]   Boy, this is gonna be a fun show.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.320]   You're not gonna talk about it.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   Google Hangouts.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.040]   Let's talk about that a little bit.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.520]   Because in all the attention to the new Google Plus, you all have the new Google Plus by
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.000]   now, I'm sure.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yes.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.400]   Which, by the way, doesn't seem so very different than the old Google Plus.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.960]   And it's pushing the collections on me like crazy.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   And I don't...
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.960]   I don't...
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   I don't want any...
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   Well, there's two things.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   One...
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.120]   So when you send a message now, it's just public or not, right?
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.120]   It's just public.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.280]   There's no selecting who to send it to.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.360]   Oh, you still have circles.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.000]   They just buried it.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   How far do they bury it?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I couldn't find it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   No, they're still there.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.800]   And that's one of the things people are complaining about is...
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:48.520]   So if you click people and then you click following, then you get circles.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   So if I post...
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   Let me see.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.520]   Let me try this.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.520]   I'll just start a post.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   There's where to choose it.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.520]   There's gonna be.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.200]   If I click public...
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.040]   This is the new...
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.200]   There's the communities.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.680]   Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the communities.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   And there's the circles.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   Okay.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.680]   Way down to the bottom.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.400]   Oh, they've made that hard.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400]   Yeah, they...
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   But you know what?
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.400]   I think what they're saying is nobody uses circles.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.880]   I didn't use them.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.360]   Well, circles basically just didn't work.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   It's the...
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.840]   You know, it's really Facebook offers lists too, but nobody really uses them or knows
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   how or...
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.080]   Well, remember, this was the answer at the time to all the complaints about privacy and
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   this and the...
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   Oh, you're sharing with...
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.320]   So at the time, well, on this show, we praised it and saw it was brilliant.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.920]   Well, and it was a good idea.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.400]   It was technically a good idea.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   I mean, it seemed like a good idea, but just nobody did it.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   It's...
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.680]   Yeah, I mean, look at the road to social media is paved with many a failed experiment.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   Oh.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.960]   And actually, I thought getting people to filter...
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:03.040]   I remember Bill Gross from my D.L.A.B. came out with what the heck was his called.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.120]   He had a thing...
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.640]   I mean, he was trying to start a new...
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.640]   I know Twitter bought his Twitter client.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.640]   Yeah, it wasn't Uber media and it wasn't...
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.600]   Yeah, no, it was a different thing.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.200]   I think I invested in it.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.880]   You know, you blank out the bad ones.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.360]   What, like, pictures?
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.400]   Was it a new colony?
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   You could follow...
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.080]   Like, I could follow Jeff and get his recipes, but not...
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.080]   Chime in?
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   Check.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   Yes.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   Was it?
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.080]   It could be, yeah.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   I did that.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   I Googled it.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   Wow.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080]   I Googled it.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.400]   And I think that was an interesting feature, but again, you have to get people on your platform
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   first.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   Right.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   And I think circles just took too much effort.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.800]   You know, you have to have the barriers to sort of interaction have to be low enough.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.960]   I just joined a new social network.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   What?
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   Called this.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.360]   I've been on there.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   I know.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   I follow you.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   You haven't been on there?
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.360]   Well, it was invite only.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   I just got my invite.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   Give me a break.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.840]   I don't have all the clout you got, Matthew Ingram.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.840]   Oh, by the way, have I introduced Matthew?
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   I did.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   Okay, good.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   All right.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   I don't have all the...
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.840]   So it's this.com.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.840]   I didn't do it.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   This.com.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.840]   Well, I didn't know.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   I went through the front door.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.840]   They said, "Oh, good.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   It will be inviting people."
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   And I filled out my address and I just got an invite.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.300]   So the whole thing here, and at first I thought, "This is really silly gimmick.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.200]   You can only post one thing a day."
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.000]   The trick will be to get people to come back every day and continue to post.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.280]   But I like the idea because that means if you can only post one thing, it better be
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.520]   a good thing, right?
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.560]   Yeah, and they do.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.840]   So I'll bet you $10.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:50.920]   I don't know this because I didn't ask Andrew Golis who one of the founders was at NewsGuys.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.040]   But I didn't ask them where the traffic comes from, but I bet a lot comes from the email
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   newsletter.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.240]   So they've got a newsletter that sends you the sort of five-thousandth.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   That's cool.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.440]   And they're almost always worth clicking.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.600]   Like that has the highest click-through rate probably of anything I subscribe to.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.640]   Well, and they have the Atlantic.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.160]   There are a lot of mainstream outlets.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.000]   And it makes sense that even if you have somebody like the Atlantic, they're not going
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.040]   to post as they would elsewhere, everything they put out.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.600]   They're going to post the one thing they think most worthy of your click, right?
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.560]   And you can see who posted it.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.200]   So you can sort of tell, it's a little like Nuzzle in a way.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.720]   You can tell which one of the people you follow or which one of your friends shared
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   it.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.800]   And that kind of gives it added credibility.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.240]   Have you ever used Nuzzle?
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.760]   I love and I live on Nuzzle.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.760]   Pretty great.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   Nuzzle, by the way, Nuzzle, you know, has a new version out.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   But people didn't really understand.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.800]   I saw this when we were at NewsGuys that in the Android version, you see a little navigation
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   on top.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.520]   But in the iOS version, you don't.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.320]   You swipe to get two different versions of those.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.960]   Three to three total.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.720]   And also it now has functionality even if you're not logged in with Twitter.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:09.040]   So it'll show you sort of recommendations even if it hasn't crawled your Twitter account.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.280]   Nuzzle, N-U-Z-Z-E-L.com is a creation of Jonathan Abrams who created Friendster.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:22.000]   And very importantly, on Nuzzle, unlike anywhere else, on Nuzzle, at least in the US, if you
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.280]   go and click on it, New York Times or a Guardian link, say that's already using AMP content.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   Nuzzle was a good earphone.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   So go to your phone.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.280]   Go to your phone.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   Go to your phone.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.280]   That was okay.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.280]   All right.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   It doesn't so much matter on the web.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.280]   Right.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:42.040]   And Jonathan told me I wrote about it when he went AMP launched and he was talking about
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.120]   why he decided to do that.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.520]   And he said he was actually thinking of trying to come up with his own.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.200]   So indeed, after his first guys.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.480]   Paul Cinkey and I wrote a column saying this is what Google ought to do.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.080]   They don't do an open source version of this.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.000]   At the time, Google was saying, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.960]   Jonathan contacted me and we were about to try to put together a little consortium of
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.880]   publishers to try to set the standards.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.760]   And then I heard where the Google was working on it.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.080]   And then they finally told Jonathan about it.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.640]   And so he's a very early adopter of...
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.000]   And his point was that one of the best parts is, you know, he was thinking of what he
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.200]   was thinking about as a sort of aggregator.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.000]   Publishers, if they wanted to do Facebook and Apple news and something else, you have to
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.240]   come up with a completely different...
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.320]   You know, you have to arrange your content and use a different API and sort of jump through
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.320]   specific hoops.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.080]   And he was looking for something that was open and sort of cross platform.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   And then AMP came along.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   I think it's just...
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.160]   If you're doing it, Leo, I think it's just your times.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   Okay.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   And I just...
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.720]   I had to install a nozzle because I...
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   Oh.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   Well, I use it on the desktop religiously.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   It's amazing.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   It's amazing.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.040]   You'll see you'll see the...
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.320]   The lightning bolt.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.280]   The lightning bolt.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.640]   Oh, that's what tells you you're on an AMP site.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.640]   Well, actually, yes.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.520]   Both AMP and Facebook and certain articles use lightning bolts.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   So there's a lightning bolt.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.320]   And so does Twitter moments.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320]   So we should...
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.840]   I don't think we explain what Nuzzle.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:23.480]   The idea of Nuzzle is that you add your Twitter and Facebook account and then it will show
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.160]   you in three columns, news from your friends.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.800]   That is the most retweeted or reshared articles that your people, your following, have shared,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.720]   which is really a kind of a good way of selecting the content.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.000]   But the next one is news from friends of friends, which is kind of interesting.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.280]   It's a great way to catch up.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.520]   If you haven't been on Twitter for a while and you want to see what people have been sharing,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.760]   it's a really easy way to catch up.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:56.640]   And then the third column is news you may have missed, which kind of...
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.720]   They call it Discover on the...
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.280]   Which is probably a better name, actually Discover on the app.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.200]   I actually prefer the friends of friends and the Discover just because...
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   I'm so...
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   I want serendipity too.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.440]   Social media, mad that I've all...
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.000]   I in fact have already had read.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Share it with me.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.640]   So you want that next layer out.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.440]   And there is where you have discoveries, which are really cool.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.640]   I'm looking for a New York Times article, because so I can see...
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.560]   It's funny how few New York Times articles seem to be in today's feed.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.240]   That's all there is one.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.400]   Reporter of forced release of Laquan McDonald videos barred from news event.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.800]   All right, I'm going to hit that.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.040]   Oh, I just see that.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.600]   That was a lightning ball.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   So that means it's ants.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   Guardian doesn't do that.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.280]   And then so now this is going to...
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   This loads faster.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   Guardian Washington Post.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.800]   Guardian Washington Post New York Times.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   Okay.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.720]   So if you want to see folks how it works.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.880]   Well, I don't know.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.880]   It loads faster.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.040]   Here's the Washington Post.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.520]   Well then click on it.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   Ooh.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.160]   Click on a non-amplank and compare the difference.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   I mean, this really does...
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.120]   Stay on me, Jason, because you're going to miss the...
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.160]   It's so fast that you're going to miss the lightning bolt.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   Oh, like folks don't...
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160]   Don't like...
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.320]   Oh, I just did that one.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.600]   The Guardian does it too, huh?
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   Guardian does it too.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   Here we go.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.200]   Saudi Arabia advertises for eight new executioners.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   Oh, good news.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   All right.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.800]   Let's hit that lightning bolt.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   Nope.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   Nope.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   Didn't get it that time.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   Click him fast.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.480]   It was fast, but it wasn't...
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.200]   So let's find another New York Times or WAPO.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.960]   Was Jeff Bezos at...
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.560]   Say, news guys, he should be, right?
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   He was not...
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.200]   Anybody from WAPO?
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.800]   Yes, Martin, I mean, not very...
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.920]   I like calling it WAPO.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920]   Cap, yes.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.320]   I was there in front of the...
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   New York Times.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.680]   Forget Turducken, it's Pie Kakin' time.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.680]   All right, so I'm going to hit that lightning bolt.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   Boom!
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   Boom!
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   It's so fast.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   Now go back, Leo.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   Click on a BuzzFeed link or something like that.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.680]   Well, okay, TechCrunch, how about that?
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.720]   Google's plan to accelerate the mobile web will go live early next year.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   That's AMP!
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   Let's see if the AMP story is AMPed.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.040]   It's not so slow.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.640]   Not bad.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.640]   By the way, it's a one paragraph article.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.840]   Yeah, well, it's because they don't want you to have the whole thing.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   LA Times.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.840]   Yes, that's...
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.400]   That was pretty fast, too.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.320]   Well, still loading.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   Still loading.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.800]   Well, even on AMP, the ads load later.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.640]   So you can still find that ads take a while, but that's the ad server.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   It's fault.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   Is there not AMPed?
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.280]   Yeah, damn it.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.720]   The key to AMP is it sets the...
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.680]   As Gurey Cimel has always done, it sets the architecture of the page.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.280]   So you have to set the ad sizes.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.680]   So the page doesn't go reconvigorated itself constantly.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   Here's the new Gawker.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.080]   What do you think about that?
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.960]   The Buddha-sized Gawker.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.360]   Gawker has decided to...
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.200]   There, lightning bolt.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   Boom!
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   Boom!
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.720]   It's cool if there was a noise as well.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.960]   It is the Marvel Comics version of The Washington Post.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   But, you know, what's...
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:17.200]   I think this is critical because the experience is such that you feel like you're left bezel.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   Still have an ad.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   It does.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.640]   It feels like distributed content.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.040]   It feels like the content is there.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.040]   Right.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.200]   And I think there's all kinds of new things that one could do.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   Oh, damn.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   It's not so native.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.280]   Let's load Buzzfeed, see what happens.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   It's, you know, I don't know if that's that it.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   I don't know.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   No, it's still...
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.720]   No, I am definitely is a superior experience.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.520]   So Jonathan's absolutely right.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.640]   And by the way, the column is now in my Android one.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.920]   So the swipe, you are...
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   No, it's been on Android.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.920]   It wasn't on iOS before.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   It wasn't on iOS.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   That wasn't on iOS.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920]   Oh, okay.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   I like this.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.520]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.160]   Jonathan's done a good job.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.560]   He's gotten some really good investors.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.560]   Now, do...
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.880]   Okay, so let's look at my desktop now, Jason.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.960]   By the way, Jason Hall taking the day off because it's Thanksgiving.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.120]   He's got a family.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.520]   So Jason Clant, this is our producer technical director today.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:22.280]   So on my desktop, you know, this is a story and I get six friends, shared it, and then
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.640]   I can tweet it or share it.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   But I never do that.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.240]   Am I a bad nuzzler because I don't re-share?
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   I just consume?
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   No.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.960]   No, I don't think so.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   Because your share is...
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.200]   No, you're contributing to it because your recognize is what you share on Twitter and
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   Facebook.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.440]   So as long as I share on Twitter and Facebook, that's where it gets the value.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.440]   Okay.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.840]   I don't have to do a through-nuzzle, I guess.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.720]   We should have a total of them on show.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   If you do share those things, you're helping the source.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   You're not really helping them.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.840]   So let me load that same Washington Post article without AMP just to see what that looks like
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   on the...
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.520]   It's still pretty fast.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.120]   That was pretty instant.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.600]   We are internet is really fast here.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.120]   It's better to test it on a slow internet.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.400]   Well, and the Post and the Times are pretty...
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   The pretty lovely.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.040]   And the Guardian are pretty optimized.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   You should try going just for fun.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.440]   Well, I don't want to pick an internet.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.520]   I have an ad-locker running as well, which helps a lot.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.560]   You should turn that off and try going because the Chicago Sun-time.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.360]   It's one of the worst websites I've ever seen in my life.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.840]   Oh, that makes me sad.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.080]   Well, USA Today is worse.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.080]   It's worse.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.080]   The first thing...
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.120]   The content in the Chicago Sun-times is better than USA Today.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.520]   You can't get to the content.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   Oh, no, really?
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.840]   Yeah, trust me.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:43.800]   There's so many pop-ups and pop-overs and auto-playing ads and then it's just mind-blowing.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   All right, let me first...
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.080]   I'm gonna load it.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.840]   It loads decently without with the ad-blocker.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.480]   But let me turn the ad-blocker off and...
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.520]   Oh, yeah, there's a lot.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   It's still blocking stuff.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   Now let me turn it with the...
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.520]   Oh, oh, oh, my God.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.240]   This is like a radio station site.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.760]   By the way, where's the X?
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   Who knows?
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   Who knows?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.440]   Oh, there it is.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.880]   It's way over here.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.600]   It only moves around.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.680]   Oh, Lord, this is horrible.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.080]   Where's the content you were looking for?
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.720]   Well, this looks like a radio station site.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.160]   Click it on a story.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.760]   Oh, troubling history of Chicago cop.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.480]   At the time it's all loaded, you basically get a headline.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.600]   It's still loading.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   Ads are still loading.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.280]   It crashed my browser.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.080]   Trying to load like 85 different JavaScripts.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   Let me see if...
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.400]   And I shouldn't mock them because this is my radio station in the land.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.880]   I love them dearly.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.400]   But this isn't as bad as...
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.680]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.040]   I have an ad-blocker running.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   Hold on.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.560]   That's the ad-blocker.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.240]   Reload this page.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.440]   Yeah, this is actually radio station sites are notoriously bad.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.440]   It's like the radio...
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.440]   It's like AM radio and...
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   You know, you know, "Hello."
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   It's just...
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.440]   Okay, there that giant ad just slid all the content right off the page.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.840]   Oh, it's back.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   Oh, man.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.480]   Try to remember the tech site.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.600]   There's a tech site where you go and the whole page is an ad.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:29.120]   And then over on the right-hand side, there's a tiny, tiny, little sort of two pixel wide
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   bar.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   And that's the content.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.880]   And you have to click on it and then it slides over in front of the ad.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   But you've seen Ling's cars, right?
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.000]   I mean, you got to respect that.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   No, no.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.160]   This is one where it's saying, "Hey, you know, I'm going to do every crappy JavaScript
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   I could find."
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.680]   It's sort of retro in a way.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.440]   That's no AMP.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   This is...
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.680]   Yeah, I would love to see Ling's cars on AMP.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.080]   Look at there's a chicken wandering on her Twitter feed.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.680]   It's a form of art, almost.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.840]   It actually is a form of art.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.680]   I've been trying to get her on the triangulation.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.840]   I'm in love with Ling.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.280]   I think Ling with is...
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.120]   That's awesome.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.840]   Ling is the thing.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   She's just...
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   That's brilliant.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   It's all yeah.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.280]   She's an English car sale site or rental site or something.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.480]   I don't know if you're epileptic.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.680]   She should have a warning.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.320]   She should have a warning, that's for sure.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.760]   She is a character.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.080]   And if you get all the way to the bottom, which is not easy, by the way, get some really...
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.280]   Oh, it's smooth.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.040]   Ling meets Fiona Bruce, whoever that is.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.480]   Ling, when you're winning, this is Ling's scrapbook.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   Wow.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.920]   That's the work of art.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.920]   It's actually...
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.240]   She was from China.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:04.080]   She was a scientist, educated in China, who came to the UK and made her way.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.520]   And by the way, here she is with her nuclear rocket billboard.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.040]   This is real.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   This is real.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.240]   It's well, there's no nukes in it.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.160]   It was a nuke at one point.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.640]   That's her ad billboard.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.600]   And for some reason, she always wears a life preserver.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   That's awesome.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:29.240]   Like the live chat window up in the...
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.240]   That's great.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.280]   Hey, I installed Tencent.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.640]   I read an article that said you should install Tencent so I did.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.640]   I'm that easy.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.680]   I'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.880]   This is funny.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.080]   Somehow one of those sites pulled up a pop under.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.800]   Now I have three easy steps to cleaning my Mac.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.760]   I've got this to sometimes.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.400]   Was that the Sun Times?
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   Oh, that's horrible.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.480]   As you know, if you haven't irritated someone enough with your ads, after they click the
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.920]   exit in your site, you should show them another shit yet.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:06.960]   Who would have thought this is such a Chicago Sun Times would be worse than Ling's cars?
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   Just so desperate.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.720]   They're doing so desperate.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.400]   And look what's going on at the LA Times.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   I mean, it is a...
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   Confirm navigation.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.840]   Please consider cleaning your Mac from junk.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.200]   Are you sure you want to leave this phase?
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.760]   Do you want to leave this phase?
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.560]   I haven't seen this in years.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.240]   No, it's like a porn site.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.160]   A little porn storm.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.840]   Thank you, Chicago, something.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.200]   But I understand if you're in print, the New York Times and the Washington Post of the
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.040]   world are few and far between LA Times.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.760]   Well, we'll talk about that too.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   There's lots to talk about.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.200]   I'm over excited from Ling.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.880]   It makes me want to do an ad.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.960]   I don't know what.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.800]   I just get the itch to do an ad.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.920]   Matthew Ingram is here for Fortune Magazine, huh?
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.040]   Can you dance like that while you're doing the ad?
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   Likely.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.400]   I gave myself a headache.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.840]   I'm a little nauseous.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   Hold on a second.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.240]   I shook my head a little too high.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.040]   Matthew Ingram is here for Fortune.com.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:15.240]   So from the city, University of New York and Buzzmachine.com are great and true friend,
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.800]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.840]   They're both longtime newspapermen.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:26.200]   We'll talk a little bit about the sad state of affairs in print in a little bit.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.040]   Our show today brought you, oh, I love this by automatic.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   Sometimes technology's come along.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.760]   They really change how you use something.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.600]   In this case, your car of all things.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.000]   This is the automatic.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.440]   Now, all cars since 1996 in the United States have an onboard diagnostic port.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.800]   We're going to OBD port under the steering wheel.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.240]   It is normally only used when you bring it into the shop and they plug it in for diagnostics,
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.360]   but it is open and it is available.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.760]   With automatic, you can plug right into it.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.200]   It's a little dongle that plugs into the OBD port and then pairs with your phone, the
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.920]   automatic app on your phone to tell you stuff about what's going on with your car.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.160]   My automatic app tells me, for instance, how much gas I use on the last trip.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:23.560]   It actually can score the trips and tell me if I accelerated too hard, sped too much,
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.920]   the kinds of things that impact gas mileage.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.560]   So it's really kind of a little trainer.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.120]   In fact, there's even additional software that you can get that will be for teenagers
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.680]   as they learn how to drive.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   Automatic is amazing.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.920]   We're going to get you a great deal on it in just a second.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.520]   This is the version 2.0.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.040]   I played with the automatic one and I'm just blown away with 2.0.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.280]   It's really great.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.400]   You could do things like get this.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.560]   I can ask the Amazon Echo because there's an Echo connection.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.200]   How much gas is in my tank?
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.960]   It will tell me.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.080]   Oh, you're almost out of gas.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.840]   If your engine light comes on automatic, the app will tell you what's wrong.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.160]   And of course, you get real-time feedback as you drive around.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.080]   I even have it hooked up to my if this than that.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:25.440]   So every trip I take is automatically logged to an Evernote notebook so I can go back and
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.720]   get a map of where I went, the cost of the gas to get there.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.320]   It's kind of an amazing thing.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.040]   It's a driving lesson.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.280]   It's informative.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.080]   It's kind of the quantified self for your vehicle.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.280]   Really, really cool.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:47.280]   Let me show you my notebook here on Evernote.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.600]   For let's find it here first.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.880]   So here's the trip I took to come to work.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.840]   2.31 mile trip.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:05.920]   2-p-n, actually it was yesterday, fuel cost $0.46 and it gives you the map, the point to
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   point.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.320]   This is amazing stuff.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.360]   And this is all logged automatically to Evernote via automatic and if this than that,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.360]   I can go on and on.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.920]   But what I want you to do is take a look at it.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:27.280]   Go to automatic.com/twit, A-U-T-O-M-A-T-I-C, just like it's the dictionary, automatic.com/twit.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.440]   Choose the off-road to check out.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.840]   You get 20% off, makes it under $80 and the software is free.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   It is really, really cool.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.960]   What I like about it is these guys are very proactive in adding to the things that will
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   do.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.040]   I mean, the echo integration that just happened.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.000]   Automatic.com/twit.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.120]   Your car has been keeping secrets from you.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.000]   With automatic, you can find out what those secrets are.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.320]   www.muffled.com/twit.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:06.360]   Don't forget to use the Twitch checkout code and save 20%.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:11.520]   This is actually a good gift and if you've got teenagers in the house, you should absolutely
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:18.960]   get one.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.840]   Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   Matthew Ingram.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.040]   Jeff worked at the San Francisco Examiner.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   Gone.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.640]   I'll go to a paper that I had no tomorrow.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   Gone.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.320]   Matthew Ingram worked at the Globe and Mail still around.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   How's the Globe and Mail doing though?
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.080]   The news guy is saying he's doing just fine, Matthew.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.080]   You're wonderful.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   Good to hear.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.240]   And I guess that's true.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.880]   What's going on?
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.400]   Really, how do you score?
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.960]   The New York Times is doing is really great because this is arguably the most important
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.560]   newspaper in the United States.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.720]   It is the grand exception to all rules.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   But is the exception?
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   Yes.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:11.400]   In a case, I remember the report that Emily Bell and Clay Shurkey and Chris Anderson,
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.360]   I think it was, did where they talked about the future of news and upfront, they said,
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.960]   "We're not even going to mention the New York Times."
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.800]   Because there are basically a unicorn.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.640]   You are not the New York Times.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.720]   Your paper is not the New York Times.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.920]   So the things that the New York Times can do, you probably won't be able to do.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.720]   Well, and the jury is still out on whether they will be enough.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   Right.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.800]   Well, and in fact, they aren't enough.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.200]   So that probably one of the world's most successful newspaper paywalls ever, and it's
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:46.320]   barely kind of keeping the Times head above water when it comes to print advertising decline
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   and circulation.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.840]   And the mission was to not decline advertising, and advertising is going down.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:59.520]   And the way the pricing is done, and this is true of other papers as well, I'm motivated
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   to get the print paper even though we never look at it.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.680]   And the advertisers are going to figure that out pretty soon.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.920]   The people who are getting the print still because they're artificially supporting print
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   because print has the advertising in it.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.360]   And the post does the same thing.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.520]   You know, somebody posted a tweet about how they couldn't figure out the pricing of the
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.760]   Washington Post paywall, and the Times is exactly the same.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.040]   And the reason you can't figure it out is because it's not designed for you.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.160]   It's not designed to appeal to consumers.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.920]   It's designed to kind of put a firewall around print ad revenues.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.800]   Who was it just tweeted recently?
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.960]   Why is it cheaper for me to get the Sunday Times delivered to my doorstep than not?
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   Right.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.240]   And the digital subscription, you actually, I get to send any Times for that reason alone
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   to save money.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   No, economically it makes sense.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.040]   It's killing trees to save money though.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.080]   Well, your eyeballs are being sold to the advertisers who advertise in the paper.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:59.480]   But again, they're going to see at some point that there's some false level of that print
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   product.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.480]   And I think they know that.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.480]   I think they know that.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   Oh, sure they do.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480]   It's just a question of the advertisers not to figure it out.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   Right.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.760]   That's a question of when advertisers decide to move on that knowledge because they clearly
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   know.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   So when you, when you, the Washington Post has taken a different route because they're
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:23.240]   owned of course by the Deep Pocketed CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, is there, is there,
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   is it just going to be his playground?
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.840]   And I'm going to, he's going to just accept losing 50 million a year or no, they just
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.160]   announced that there, they have more audience than the New York Times and Bezos was on CBS
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.440]   this morning and the paper itself trumpeted that they are out there to become the next
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.480]   paper of record, the new paper of record.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.600]   That's what he says he wants to be the neck, the new paper of fingers in the, in the eyes
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   of the New York Times.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   So it's a competitive landscape.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   But that's good.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.960]   And he has been making some, some really interesting moves and moves that wouldn't work unless
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.160]   you also ran Amazon.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:02.200]   And one is to include to bundle subscriptions with Amazon Prime, which is super smart.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.760]   And the other was to do deals with a whole bunch of other newspapers and say all of your
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.080]   subscribers can get the Washington Post subscription for free.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.320]   So that's instant distribution.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.520]   I mean, it's, it's a pretty smart move.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.240]   You know, how, how the paper is doing sort of financially is, is unknown.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.440]   But it certainly seems to be growing in terms of audience.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:32.240]   So if I'm a prime member, I can get six months free of the Washington Post, but then what?
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.440]   I haven't done this yet.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.560]   Oh, then it's no, then it's like $49 a year.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   It's very low.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.560]   It's very, very low.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.160]   It's subsidized, basically.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.440]   Well, you can look at it that way or you could say that it's, you know, what's the market
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.440]   price of it there?
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.040]   You're not, there's no paper and ink to pay for.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.040]   Right.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.200]   So no more than, no more than every movie I watched through prime is subsidized.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:59.840]   So the question is, is Jeff keeping, you know, in order to become the Journal of Record,
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.840]   which is traditionally what the New York Times has been, you'd have to be doing some
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.040]   really good journalism and reporting and quality stuff, are they?
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.920]   Which they are indeed and Marty Barron, the editor is a top editor, someone, I forget
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.720]   who was wrote a piece this week claiming he was the best editor alive.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.720]   That's the editor.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720]   Whatever, but Marty.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   No, that's sponsored.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   Advertive.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   And Bezos is investing.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.040]   You know, the journalists love it with their hiring Bezos is hiring.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:31.560]   See, hiring more journalists is how you win because we pay us more and get more of us.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:36.240]   So they can do what, you know, the New York Times write show recaps.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.400]   Or is not necessarily always the answer.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.400]   Nonetheless, nonetheless, Bezos indeed is investing in the paper.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.720]   He also went after them heavy.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.640]   I'm told about their page load, preamp.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   Oh, did it.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.200]   And they cut the heck out of it because it was ridiculous.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.040]   And he knows the value of a fast page.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:02.480]   And the best thing, the best thing about having Bezos there is that, and I said this when
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.000]   he acquired it, whatever you can say about Jeff Bezos and there are lots of things to
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.040]   say about him, he understands how things work online.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.160]   Like he lives and breathes it.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.320]   That's his, you know, he swims in it.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.800]   And so he's using that understanding, I think, to help the newspaper.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:29.680]   And instead of trying to get someone who grew up through the print era to reinvent the newspaper,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.600]   he's effectively driving it based on what he understands about how digital information
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   and content works.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.360]   And I've long said that my fondest wish for Bezos is rain at the post is that he would
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:48.720]   bring his skills at user consumer data and customization and targeting to journalism.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.040]   And that hasn't happened yet, but I'm, you know, he's, he's going on his own speed,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.760]   but the fact that he knows something about you and then acts on that to give you greater
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.240]   relevance and value and gives you transparency into how he knows it and what he's doing and
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.440]   all that stuff.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.240]   Those are tremendous skills that we need and do not have in our business.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:12.440]   Well, so think about every city in the country used to have a morning and an afternoon paper.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.840]   But we're, I mean, I think because of the internet and so forth, if we had a morning
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:22.080]   and afternoon national paper, in other words, two national papers, competing hard with each
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   other, I rule out the USA today.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   Oh, yes.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:31.800]   The nation's new pap as people put on the newsstand for the minute, they put the nation's newspaper.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.520]   They just crossed out the ER and it worked really nicely.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.320]   That would be good.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:44.160]   And that would be kind of not so very different from the day when you had the Chicago sun and
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.160]   the Chicago time.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   And I would have.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   I remember reading.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   Go ahead.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   Go ahead.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   Are you good?
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.400]   I remember reading about the early early days of newspapers.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.920]   I'm pretty sure it was San Francisco had 11 newspapers.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.480]   We had the call, the bullet and the examiner, the Chronicle.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.320]   Those are four I could just I remember.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.320]   From the 1800s.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.080]   Oh, and I was sure the days before the year was a very different time.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.360]   I even on partisan to say this as I work with them, but we have the Guardian too, which
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.920]   gives us an outside perspective.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   It's from England.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.680]   And if you think, yeah, it's a great thing about it.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.320]   Think about what newspapers used to do.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:26.760]   They used to compete for readers in a sort of defined geographical area.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.640]   Now the New York Times and the Washington Post and everyone else is competing with everything.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   Right.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   Every form of information anywhere.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   That's a challenge.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.480]   So there's no monopoly anymore.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.400]   There's no oligopoly anymore.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.400]   There's no control over the channel.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.920]   And so you just have to try a lot harder.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.520]   And I think the hard part is that a lot of newspapers just don't have the resources
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.640]   to do that because the advertising rug has been sort of ripped out from under them.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.200]   We haven't mentioned the Wall Street Journal, which I think it's fair to say is also a national
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.200]   newspaper.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.800]   And it's reporting excellent.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   So that's good.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.000]   There is competition.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.480]   And you know, but at the same time, there are newspapers all over the country folding the
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.040]   latest the LA Times.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:13.520]   I'm reading an article in the LA Observe blog.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.160]   Buy Outlist at LA Times makes you want to cry.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   They're buying out.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.160]   It's a train wreck.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.160]   It's a lot of people going.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.400]   They've they've they're among the departures to assistant managing editors, the main politics
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   editor for City Hall in LA and for California, the bureau chiefs in New York, Seattle, San
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:35.240]   Francisco, San Diego, Las Vegas, London, all the obituary writers.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.840]   But movie reviewers editorial writers.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.840]   Well, okay.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.840]   So let's stop.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   Let's stop there.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.640]   The Los Angeles Times covers Los Angeles.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   Does it need a New York bureau?
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   Well, London bureau.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.960]   But they've also fired half a dozen photographers.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.600]   They don't need photographers.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.560]   They've got to look at what the Sun Times is doing.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.040]   They basically fired their entire staff.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.880]   And now they gave their reporters iPhones said here at some point, take your own damn
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880]   pictures.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.840]   And when it comes to saying your mission here is to is to cover the local markets to cover
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.360]   a lot of the point I used to have at the Los Angeles Times was they had international
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360]   ambitions.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.120]   So they put bureaus all over the world and they abandoned Los Angeles.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.480]   They abused it.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.800]   And now they're going back to covering Los Angeles, which is what they should be doing.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   And I'm for that.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.960]   That means a much smaller organization.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   Much, much, much, much more.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   It does.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.520]   Matthew, that's true of every damn paper there is.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   They're all going to be smaller.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.560]   You think every major cities should have one highly local newspaper?
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.200]   I think it should have one highly local news organization papers the wrong word.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   Exactly.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   Think about it.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   Look at Tribune.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:46.440]   That whole model where you own a bunch of kind of regional papers or mid market papers
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:51.480]   in a bunch of different cities and you kind of you merge them all together into one big
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:56.680]   thing and you run content from one and the other and you use a lot of wire copy and you
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:02.760]   know that sort of model of newspaper chain just doesn't make any sense anymore.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   It's not going to disagree.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:09.640]   Although the New York Times owns our little Petal Duma local paper, the weekly Argus Courier,
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.320]   they also own the Santa Rosa press Democrat, which is a daily.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.000]   Oh, I thought they've got rid of those.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Maybe they do.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Maybe they do.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.840]   Also another, I think there's another sort of tsunami coming and I know Jeff will agree
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.840]   with me.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:27.880]   And that is when all the advertisers who put flyers in all those newspapers and coupons
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.120]   and so on just had for the hills or some other.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.480]   I've been writing about that for about three, four years now.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.680]   Indeed, I did some work at a certain major retailer a little over two years ago and I
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.000]   said, when's the point at which critical mass of newspaper circulation falls so that
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.160]   you're not going to have you're not going to put your circulars in the paper anymore.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.960]   And they said 24 and 36 months that were more than 24 months ago.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:55.400]   So we're not quite scheduled, but in the last 12 months, department store circulars have
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.200]   declined more than 25%.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.560]   Incidentally, you're right, Jeff, that the Times did sell both our local paper in the
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.560]   Santa Rosa.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.160]   Because it's free just now in the New York Times.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   That's it.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   That's it.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.640]   Well, I heard a story at Newsguys, which I won't attribute to anyone that a certain
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:20.760]   large retailer came into the newspapers offices and said, you know, we pay you about $18 million
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.120]   to distribute things, flyers and coupons and so on.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:30.120]   And we've run the numbers over a long period of time and we're prepared to pay you $2
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.960]   million for that.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.840]   And in return for that, in return for seeing sort of 80% of what we used to pay you out
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.840]   the window, here's what you're going to do.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.080]   You're going to do a bunch of these things.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:46.400]   And then you can thank us for the $2 million or you can have nothing.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.480]   We know what's going to happen with a circular FSI's.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.800]   It's called free-standing inserts in the business.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.840]   When you have newspapers across the country that have gone to three-day weeks of circulation,
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.560]   the reason they're preying three days a week is goes to the three days they have--
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.560]   Circular inserts.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.560]   Exactly.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.560]   It's going to go away.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.680]   And it's a wrapper for inserts.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:07.920]   I have long contended that newspapers have to set a date when they become fully sustainable
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.280]   digitally before the date at which print becomes unsustainable and no longer contributes
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.600]   profit.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.960]   And that's what we're seeing happening.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.480]   And those organizations will be much smaller.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.960]   We have ecosystems with many more organizations in them.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.480]   We have all kinds of new things to pry it up.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.720]   And I think we need a lot more.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.120]   We modeled what a market like Boston would look like.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.240]   Five years ago, we modeled what Boston would look like without the globe because of the
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.320]   time it was going to fall more than six years ago.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:38.480]   And what we found was that based on the globe's own digital revenue, you could support an
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.760]   equivalent number of journalists with a large news organization, still fairly large, covering
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:50.480]   the whole metro area, plus a blog for every 50,000 people in the market, locally, plus
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.920]   public media, plus ad networks.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.800]   And there's a model there that is workable.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.680]   It's just not the big old monopoly we used to have.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.800]   And the problem is costs have to decrease by so much.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:08.080]   That's why you see so many chains laying off huge amounts of people and cutting entire
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   layers of management because that cost structure was designed for a completely different business
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   model.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.600]   And it's just not going to work anymore.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.360]   And I think circular is part of it.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:22.240]   I remember Clay Shurky wrote about how he feels like there's another cliff coming.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:26.680]   So advertisers, it's still falling at revenue.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:32.200]   But once newspapers and their circulation or the reach get below a certain point, advertisers
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.040]   are just going to pull the trigger and say, we're not advertising with you at all because
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.760]   you're just not big enough, or you don't have the reach or you don't have the targeting
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.920]   that we want.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.640]   And those ads will go.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.880]   It's not like they will reduce.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.680]   They'll disappear.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.120]   Or turn into Chicago sometimes.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.880]   Yeah, those ads will still be around.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880]   They'll be worth 0.00.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.120]   They're worth nothing but they're there.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.760]   That's what's really sad.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.400]   You're plaguing me with these ads and you're making no money also.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.040]   And I think, you know, going back to Bezos, I think this is a good point to make that
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:14.520]   Bezos at least, you know, he runs a giant retailer and how do retailers make money by
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.400]   serving their customers?
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.000]   How do newspapers make money?
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.040]   By shoving crappy ads in your face and hoping that you will click on them?
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.720]   Like, it's a difference of the way you look at what your duty is.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.840]   And if newspapers looked at serving their readers as their duty, they wouldn't use all
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.840]   those ads.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.880]   They would figure out a better way somehow.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:44.440]   Google says, according to, I can't ever pronounce his name, Erzholz.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   Erzholz.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.440]   Erzholz.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   Erzholz.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.440]   Erzholz.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   Erzholz.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   Erzholz.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   The boss of the cloud.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.440]   It's a hudse.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.440]   It means bear.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   Erzholz.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   What does hudsele mean?
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.600]   No other means bear hug.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.440]   Americans can't say this.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:08.060]   According to Google's eighth employee, he says, by 2020, Google's ad revenues will be
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:12.080]   outpaced by their cloud revenue.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:18.000]   The goal for us to talk about Google is a cloud company by 2020.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   This was Amazon Envy.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   It may be-
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.240]   Yeah, they definitely, they want AWS.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   I mean, that-
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:28.960]   Well, by the way, yeah, Jeff Bezos is more than a newspaper mogul and a retailer.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.080]   He happens to run the number one cloud service in the world.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.360]   And you look at that company, we only just recently got information about it.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.040]   But look at what happened there.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:45.120]   They built what's effectively a 30, 40, 50 billion dollar company inside Amazon without
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   anyone really realized.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.120]   Oh, this is a hobby.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:51.680]   It's like somebody- I read in Dogfight the story and I'm trying to remember it.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.840]   But basically somebody said, "You know, Jeff, we've got these servers or not really."
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.640]   It was a Skunk Works.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.200]   It was very, very wonderful.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.200]   Bear in her photos.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   Bear in her photos.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   He's the-
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   Brilliant.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.400]   Bear in her is absolutely brilliant.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:11.200]   He's a great, great, wonderful bear of a guy and unsung, I think, in all of this world.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.080]   He's one of the great geniuses of the technology business.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.440]   I wonder if he cries at his desk every day.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   I don't think-
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.440]   I don't think-
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:25.280]   He goes stopping around saying, "Bears the free food."
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.880]   His name should be Urs because he looks like a bear-like fella.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.920]   He's the CTO at Amazon.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.000]   So he got his reward.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.960]   Not that long ago there was actually debate about whether AWS was even making money.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.600]   There was debate about whether it was even beneficial to Amazon.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.600]   If they spun that out tomorrow, it would be worth $40 billion.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.240]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:53.360]   It was an internal project, basically.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   And think about it.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.160]   Google should really be there already.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.160]   They've got-
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   Microsoft should be there.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.160]   IBM should be there.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.160]   Yes.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   Yes.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.160]   Nobody's that we're in the cloud.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.920]   EMC should be there.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.560]   They have all the tools.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.480]   They just didn't do it.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.560]   Amazon did something right.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.560]   Again.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:18.600]   And you know, when I look at things like the Echo, I think Amazon is a darker-
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.400]   Look, they failed with a smartphone.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   Okay.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.240]   But they're a dark horse in many areas.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   Don't write them off.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.680]   Nobody's writing them off.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:34.400]   The whole delivery mechanism that's out there bringing physical world into this, the huge
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   disruption yet to be had.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.040]   And Uber is going to play in that.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.720]   Amazon is going to play in that.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.920]   Google wishes to play in it, but it really has just very small efforts since there was
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   this.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:50.240]   But that's why I don't understand is why can't Google go up against Amazon and win?
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.240]   They can.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:56.360]   Right now, the problem is they could in a lot of ways, but number one, they don't have fulfillment
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.360]   until now.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.760]   Well, they closed Google code, right?
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:04.440]   I mean, this was a big, some of the areas where they went head to head against Amazon,
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.440]   they've already conceded.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.080]   Yeah, true.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.240]   You win Amazon.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.320]   That's not how you beat them.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:19.560]   I think actually that the structure of Alphabet might help.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.720]   You know, they might be able to do things that they couldn't before.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.960]   And you could say Google's picking its fights and maybe says, well, who cares if we win
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.440]   and compute engines.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.440]   And it's interesting.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:36.240]   Didn't someone say that now with the Alphabet structure, they'll be asking units, like operating
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:41.640]   units underneath Alphabet to basically pay for services that Alphabet renders like say
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   cloud services?
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.280]   Well, that's a standard corporate thing.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   Right.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   Charge it back.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.280]   We're corporate.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   We're here to help now pay us.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.280]   Charge it back.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.080]   Well, that's how it may just be an accounting formality too.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.120]   You know, Twig would be worth $3 billion if Leo didn't charge us.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.120]   The rental de-steps.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.120]   Right.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   How can I?
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.440]   I got a, you know, that's a good idea.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.240]   Let me think about this.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.400]   How can I make more money?
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.120]   No, we do that a little bit.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:16.520]   We separated out the sales from Twit into a different agency.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:22.600]   I mean, from the point of view, it's almost an accounting thing, but it also separates
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.600]   it.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:30.280]   And it means that the sales company, Artisanal could sell to other, sell other, I don't
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   know.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   I don't understand.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   It's not the name of it.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   Artisanal.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   Oh, it's pretty good.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   Is that a good name?
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   I've always said this is Artisanal Media.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.880]   It's more like handmade kind of custom.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.320]   We're not, we're bespoke.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.880]   We're not trying to do mass media.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.480]   We're doing kind of media targeted media.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:50.440]   And that's actually one of the areas of media that I'm the most enthusiastic about
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.760]   is what I've called Artisanal Media.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.680]   Yeah, you and me both, Bill.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:59.200]   One person, two people, six people, ten people.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   Right.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   Have a business, make a living.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.640]   And super-servant niche as opposed to try to be all things to all people.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.120]   And that's the other thing that newspapers, like Jeff's point about sort of serving your
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:13.800]   local market, that's the other thing that they tried to do was to be mass.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.560]   And mass just doesn't work anymore unless you're on the Facebook.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.680]   Yeah, it sounds like they tried to be.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.400]   They were successful at it.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:28.080]   But what we've done is take reach and frequency, volume-based business, and try to put it into
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.240]   what is meant to be a very customized business.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.720]   You know, Google is not a mass company.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.280]   Google is trying to sell ads that are highly targeted to you individually.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.640]   Facebook is not a mass company.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.640]   You know, two people see the same Facebook.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.560]   The content and ads that you get are, they're both personal services company.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.640]   And media companies don't know how to do that.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.320]   Unless we learn how to do that, we're still here.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.800]   It's too late.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.400]   Because I think, you know, the newspapers, this was years ago, I remember talking to the
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:01.800]   Globe and saying fundamentally, we do not know anything about the person who clicks and
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.480]   comes to our home page.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.320]   We might know where they came from, like the URL they visited just before that.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.080]   But other than that, we know nothing.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.560]   We don't know what to show them.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.680]   We don't know what not to show them.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.760]   And it hasn't really improved that much.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.760]   Not just the Globe.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.800]   I'm not talking about the Globe.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:24.000]   But knowing your reader and being able to have a relationship with them then allows you
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.360]   to show them the things they want and not show them the things they don't want.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:33.320]   But isn't it kind of ironic now that news is moving in the opposite direction of the
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:39.120]   with Facebook owning basically the platform and knowing the reader in ways that the news
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.960]   organization that posts on Facebook cannot.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.640]   Apple's news does it's opaque to the...
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:46.640]   That's why they're winning.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.240]   That's why they're winning because they know they understand the customer.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.960]   Well, Apple's news is crap.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.000]   Well, thank God it's crap.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Seriously.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   I agree.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.520]   But Facebook's is not.
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.120]   And so this is also...
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.200]   So I wrote a column in the Observer not to plug in what I'm today.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.440]   The New York Observer not the other.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   I just read it.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.840]   About news guys in which, you know, I hear journalists love to moan and whine and complain
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.720]   as I say it, and we are heard of yours.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:20.760]   But we've got to engage with and find peace with and negotiate with the technologists.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:26.920]   And we try to act still as if we're above it and but Google amp came out of news, the
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.520]   last two news guys Amazon is I mean, app.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.920]   Which Facebook does come to news?
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   Right.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.000]   But they don't come to those things.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Well, they weren't invited.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.560]   I think in the past Matthew they were invited this year didn't come.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.600]   But Twitter came.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:45.240]   And I think that we journalists have to engage with the technologists and learn to start
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.680]   to engage with the publishers.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.440]   And now we've got to do the same thing back.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.960]   And I hear that from some journalists.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   But I also hear a lot of complaining and whining and oh, two people were quoted as saying
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.200]   that if Facebook held news guys they wouldn't go.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   That's ridiculous.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:08.960]   But from what you just said, this is kind of a step backwards for news organizations
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.400]   because Twitter and Facebook do on the relationship at the cost of the news organizations.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.280]   Well, okay, so that's our own damn fault because we don't don't capitulate your
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   computer.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   You're capitulating if you're publishing on face?
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   No, no, I disagree.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   It's the opposite.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.360]   I think that what we have to do is negotiate with Facebook.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.440]   We've recognized that our users in the public we want to serve are there a billion people
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   a day go to Facebook.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   We're going to ignore them.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.600]   No, we've got to go there too.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.200]   I actually counsel media companies that they should consider starting entire products on
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.200]   Facebook.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.480]   Now that there's monetization there, yes, you're vulnerable to them, but that's the reality.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.840]   And what we need to negotiate back from Facebook and Google, and I've talked about this with
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.760]   both companies and I'll keep on talking about it with both of them, is to say we need user
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.640]   interest data back so we can build our own relationships.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.400]   However, however, I've heard this from technologists.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:02.280]   Okay, Jarvis, if we gave some data to your beloved newspaper people, they wouldn't know
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.720]   what to do with it.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.560]   And in 99% of the cases, that is true and it's a fair criticism.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.720]   So we have to build entirely new skill around creating products that are not just one size
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.160]   fits all mass volume based things, but that are more targeted to people's communities
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.720]   and interests and needs as individuals and towns and such.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.920]   We then have to be able to get that data, analyze it and be able to act on it so we can
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.960]   actually give you not just targeted advertising, but also targeted content so we can give you
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   more things.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.360]   We've got to change our fundamental business model and culture and we can't just sit back
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.560]   and wind that.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.840]   Well, Facebook has people.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.400]   Yeah, and why do they?
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.640]   Because they created an entire architecture that treats people as individuals, not as
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.640]   a mass.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   God, Gary?
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.840]   But I think it's about more than just, and I agree with you, that we should be negotiating
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.560]   and we should be getting something back, including data.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.400]   But I think it's about more than that.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.560]   One of the things that we talked about in news guys was that Facebook pretends, and
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:04.720]   you know the comments I'm referring to, pretends that the algorithm just kind of behaves magically
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.960]   and you effectively control it, which we know isn't true.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:15.320]   And Facebook, if Facebook wants lots of news companies to effectively shovel all their
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.920]   content onto Facebook, which the Washington Post is doing, 100% of its content shows up
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   on Facebook.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.120]   It's all about the reason it became number one over the New York Times.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   It's a very smart tactic.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120]   Right.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.320]   But if Facebook wants news companies to do that, it needs to do more than just give
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.640]   them data about their readers.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.400]   It needs to, it has responsibilities as a news platform.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.400]   And I'm not-
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.400]   Yes, that's a discussion.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.680]   And I've had that discussion with executives there.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.680]   And-
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   Right.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   And we need to have that conversation.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:49.360]   Yeah, because the algorithm is effectively determining what news people see and what they
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.520]   don't see.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.360]   And there is no public information about that algorithm.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.920]   There's no way of knowing why it's just going on.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   I don't think that's a certain thing.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   I don't think-
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.120]   So what you're really asking for, we have a bad Matthew, what you're really asking for
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.440]   is for editors to be able to manipulate the algorithm.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.440]   No.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.160]   And that has happened in the past.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160]   That is-
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   Well, I need to know what's in the algorithm.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160]   This is not what I'm asking for.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.640]   So I can change my news so I can get into that algorithm.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640]   No.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640]   It's not what I'm asking for.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:20.080]   I'm asking Facebook to publicly talk about its responsibilities as a part of-
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   Yes, that's a different question.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   Yes, I agree with those-
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   I agree with those-
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.080]   That's a different question.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.080]   That's a different question.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.280]   That's it's algorithm controls what people see and what they don't see.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.880]   And I'm not saying that they're evil.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.320]   I'm not saying that Mark Zuckerberg is trying to ruin journalism or trying to change people's
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.200]   minds in some evil way.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.200]   I'm saying they have that effect even though lots of people don't know it.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.640]   I sat beside a woman on the way back from Phoenix, a woman who sells technology who's
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.400]   mature and well-informed.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.600]   And I said, "Do you know that Facebook filters your newsfeed?"
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   No, I didn't know that.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.600]   What?
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   So she's pretty-
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   Wow.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   Her newsfeed-
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.440]   Something like 45 to 50 percent of people don't know if their feed is being filtered.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:03.280]   But then- Well, it's all on the right column.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.640]   You can see everything that's there and they wouldn't want that and everybody knows that.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   There's-
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.560]   Well, let me agree with you Matthew.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   Maybe try to agree with you in a second.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   Let me try to agree with you.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.120]   I'm not going to have to separate you guys.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.120]   Am I the other responsibility?
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.120]   Stop there.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.120]   Stop there.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.560]   Don't make me pull this podcast over.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.560]   Go ahead.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.840]   Responsibility piece has another angle to it which is that when trouble comes, what does
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.840]   Facebook do?
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.840]   What does Google do?
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.600]   What does Twitter do?
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   Right?
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.000]   So when a government comes and says, "Take that down," what's your responsibility?
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.720]   And that's the discussion that- and you're referring to a discussion at the Perusion Journalism
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:46.280]   Festival, that's the discussion that our fellow journalism professor was asking for.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.160]   And that's a discussion that indeed does need to be held.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.840]   And I've said this to them afterwards, that we need to be able to have that discussion
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.240]   to say that whether they like it or not, and I wrote a long piece about this some time
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:01.440]   ago, whether they like it or not, Facebook is in the position of being a primary distributor
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.440]   of news.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440]   And with that comes responsibility.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.120]   It's not just about all the mysterious algorithm.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.360]   It's also about the decisions they make.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.320]   In terms of the algorithm, I'm still going to disagree with you there.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.720]   The extent that yes, there's a filter.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.840]   No, people don't want everything.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.920]   When Facebook did put up with Washington Post and the Guardian, a news thing where the newspapers
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.320]   did control stuff, every single reader complained they were being spammed by the damn newspapers
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.280]   because again, it didn't have any relevance to them.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.360]   So it's not an evil thing.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.560]   It's not a bad thing that Facebook trust upon some relevance.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.040]   I argue indeed, that's exactly what news organizations should be copying and figuring
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040]   out how to do themselves.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.920]   I'm not saying it's bad.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:43.560]   I'm saying they need to admit what they are doing and talk about the effects.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560]   They don't.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.840]   They don't talk about what you just finished saying.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.920]   They don't talk about when they take things down.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.840]   They don't talk about why they take them down.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.200]   That's not what they don't provide information.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.520]   Look at Google and Twitter.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.520]   That's it.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.520]   Just let me finish.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.520]   No, you just said two different things, Matthew.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.200]   One thing is when the algorithm filters and tries to give you what is most relevant to
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   you, that's the automated piece.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:07.960]   The second piece is if they choose manually to take something down because the government,
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.200]   let's say, came after them, that's a different question.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.600]   They're both important questions, but they're different questions.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   That's all I'm proud to say.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   They are different questions.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.600]   But the, and so the one that I think is the most important, I think the algorithm and
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.120]   talking about how it works is also important.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.120]   So what is the most important?
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   The other one.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.120]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.120]   Stay right there.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   What does that get you then?
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.280]   So they say, okay, we favor this and not that.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.800]   What's every newspaper going to do?
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.080]   They're going to go and try to manipulate their feeds to try to just get more volume
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.080]   than you do.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.360]   I'm not talking about details about how the algorithm functions.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.480]   I'm talking about how the functions.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.120]   What is he, what is he want to know?
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.120]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.120]   Tell me what you want to know.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.480]   Tell me what you want to know.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.280]   Tell me what you want to know.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.680]   What is it you to feel you don't know about how our personalization algorithm works that
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   you feel you need?
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.680]   What are you going to know?
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   What do you want to know?
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.680]   What I don't know.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.240]   It's what users don't know.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.600]   I know lots of things about Facebook that apparently regular people don't know.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.520]   Well, but even I don't know.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:11.800]   I don't know why it's only showing one in three articles that my mom posts or why it's
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.920]   only it's decided not to do the story about this where it does do the story about that.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920]   No one knows that, right?
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   It's taking this very complex.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.480]   But that's like the Google algorithm, right?
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.480]   That's proprietary.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:28.200]   I'm not saying they have to publicize all the entire way the algorithm functions.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:33.480]   I'm saying they have to talk about how that works and why maybe you're not seeing Beirut
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.000]   news when it happens.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.920]   But you saw Paris news.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.680]   I think people don't know that.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.280]   They don't know.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.400]   I'm not talking about the specifics of the algorithm.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.800]   I'm talking about that there is an algorithm and that they control it instead of saying
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.440]   we're just showing you what you want to see.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.440]   I think that's self-evident.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.200]   It's very vague.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.480]   And that's why Andy Mitchell got so much pushback because he was saying, well, we're not showing
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.960]   you specific things.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.000]   You're choosing those things.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.080]   So here's a let me give you a data point.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080]   Where are you from?
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.080]   We have a nice visitor in the audience.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.680]   Yeah, where are you from right now?
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.040]   Yeah, he's a local guy.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.160]   He says, oh, it's totally random, right?
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   No.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.000]   Well, not even close.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.520]   Not even close.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.440]   But that's your point, Matthew, which is most people don't even know Facebook's doing anything
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   at all.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.640]   I mean, I think people are starting to realize I'm not seeing everything, but they don't
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   know why.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.960]   So people get a filtered view of the world, but they are unaware that that's occurring.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.480]   And thank you for it.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.880]   And some millennials get 60% of their news or something or 60% of millennials get a
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.960]   substantial proportion of their news from Facebook and they don't realize that it's
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.280]   being filtered.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280]   So that's one problem.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:49.240]   The other problem is when they do take down content, they don't talk about it as much
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.720]   as say Twitter and Google do.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.400]   Twitter and Google provide a lot more information about what government asked to have it taken
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.480]   down, what specifically the government didn't like about it.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.240]   Twitter is very transparent about that.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.840]   And I give them credit for doing that.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.280]   Facebook just says we took a bunch of stuff down.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.040]   They don't tell us in the report.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:11.960]   Well, I think they took down a bunch of stuff that prisoners had posted in the US and never
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.360]   mentioned it.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.080]   They took down thousands of posts based on requests.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.520]   Presumably you don't deny that.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:24.280]   Do you Jeff that Facebook is very autocratic in its choices?
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.360]   Well, I think, for example, there are no breast policy.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.440]   Yes, perfect example, no breastfeed.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:32.360]   It's culturally insensitive and many many parts of the world.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.360]   Right.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.640]   And if it's their choice, they can do that.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.720]   But I think it's a problem.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:41.240]   But and don't you think it's a problem when, as Matthew points out, a significant number
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:46.720]   of people get their news, not from the Washington Post, New York Times, NBC, but from Facebook.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.960]   You know, both of you, there's there's a logical problem you have because what you're
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.400]   trying to compare to is the idea when you had a news product in which everything that
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.440]   an editor decided was in there and by God, the editors in charge, sorry over.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.440]   Right.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.840]   And it's over anyway, because no one goes to home pages anymore.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.320]   No one goes to see the package that is news put out by an editor anymore.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.200]   Home page traffic to most news sites in America is hovering around 10%.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.600]   So the package is already gone.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.760]   You are seeing a small subset of the news that anyone given publication gives you based
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.840]   on a number of factors, including in the first, especially friends recommendations.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.960]   So you blame your friends first for not giving you every story in the Washington Post.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.120]   Well, and I think so that's the question about if I don't see I wrote a post about
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]   this.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.560]   If I don't see Beirut news in my feet, is that my fault?
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.000]   Because I didn't click on certain things.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   Is it my fault?
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.520]   Because I have done friends who didn't.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.560]   Well, it's your fault for getting your news from Facebook.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.160]   That's whose fault is real.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.160]   For filtering the feed.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160]   Right.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.600]   No, I mean, I think it's everyone's fault.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:53.480]   If you want to if this is something in your head, I want to get a well rounded news.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.040]   There's never been a better time to do that than right now.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040]   I agree.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   I agree.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.480]   And I think we do need to we need to tell people that it's they have a responsibility.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.800]   Yeah, it is your other.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800]   But that welcome.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:04.800]   This is a different message.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.440]   Facebook also has a responsibility if it is a big platform for news and it's trying to
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.040]   become an even bigger one.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.120]   It's incumbent on Facebook to behave in a certain way as a news platform.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.240]   Well, just so you know, Matthew, this is the same argument I've had about Google with
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:24.720]   Jeff for ages that Google because it is the search engine for the world.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.480]   It basically powers the internet has a higher responsibility than just its own business
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:29.480]   interests.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.480]   Great.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.360]   But I think if Facebook takes down a page about refugees, you know, who and because they're
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.840]   just that those photos are disturbing, or they take down a page put up by Syrian dissidents
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.320]   or something, I think they it is incumbent on them to talk about that they did it and
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.680]   why they did it and to defend themselves.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   Wow.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.960]   Well, you realize that that's never going to happen.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.200]   There is going to be a discussion.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.920]   I just put up a column I wrote about just this.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.000]   Matthew, you and I've had this discussion on the show before.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.600]   We've already been there.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.880]   And no, I think that there is an interest.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:13.440]   The problem is that it's a bit of a culture clash in terms of trying to go to technology.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.960]   Because you just said Matthew, they don't see them say, you know, they call it news feed.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.720]   They don't see their primary role on earth as to as to inform the world with news.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720]   Right.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.120]   Their primary goal is to connect people with each other, then with information and then
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.920]   with things that are engaging and interesting.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.920]   That's what they've said.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.920]   I've heard that from their mouths, right?
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.040]   So, so news is part of that.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.440]   They now acknowledge, in fact, they acknowledge it.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.360]   I think in a lot of ways better than Google.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.720]   Google has only just now gotten news into the product and engineering side of the company,
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.560]   not just the marketing side.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.040]   Whereas at Facebook, they have interest targeting, they have instant articles, they have notified.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.720]   They have all these products that they're working around news and they care about news.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.360]   Now, where you and I adamantly agree and where I've had this conversation with them
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.760]   and I'll have it again and we should have it again and again and again is to say that
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.160]   there is a complex discussion about whether or not Facebook chose to become a primary
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.360]   distributor of news.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360]   It is.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.960]   And then in this society, certain responsibilities either fall to them or don't at their choice,
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.160]   but that's a discussion we need to have.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.480]   And you can't say that they're never going to have it because we've just asked once or
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.600]   twice and they're nervous about it because what happens when they try to have it at
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.200]   all, what happens?
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.120]   Every damn journalist jumps down their throat.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.400]   That's the piece of art for the observer was the journalist just constantly complaining.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.720]   They kind of don't know what to do about it.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.080]   And this frankly is what pissed off Larry Page and drove him away from news for some
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.880]   time was the culture of our damn complaining industry.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.640]   We deal with different views here and we've got to respect each one and try to figure out
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.760]   where we can build the bridges.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.760]   And that's why I think this guy is really important because it starts to do that.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.280]   And I think we need a similar thing with Facebook and I think that Facebook will be
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.680]   interested in doing that.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:02.160]   But we've got to figure out a way that can do that that lets them have a first most comfortable
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.520]   interaction with this rather than everybody jumping down their throat, which is what
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.440]   why they need so silent these days.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:14.480]   All I'm saying is going back to your statement about Facebook cares about news or shows that
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.480]   it cares about news.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.400]   I'm not convinced that it has shown that it's shown that it wants news.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:29.920]   It's shown that it cares about news because it's shown that it likes news and wants news
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.440]   because that encourages people to engage.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:40.200]   But it has not shown that it cares about how it delivers it and why it takes it down.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.200]   Who's showed risk box?
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.200]   Chris Cox.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.200]   What do you mean takes down?
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.840]   They're not taking down a bunch of news.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.800]   Number two, Chris Cox is the head of product Facebook.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.960]   And Chris Cox, they're taking down a bunch of news stories.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:59.480]   They're taking down pages that contain information that is important about social events, journalism
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.760]   broadly speaking.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:04.000]   Not articles from The Washington Post or articles from The New York Times.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.240]   Things that you and I know journalism is larger than that.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:13.280]   They take down things that could be a historical record of facts and information about the
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.440]   world.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.440]   And they need to talk about why they do that.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.360]   Examples of things that you're objecting to.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.240]   So the biggest example I can think of is Elliot Higgins has written about Syrian dissident
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.840]   pages that were taken down by Facebook.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:32.160]   Pages that talked about attacks by the government that contain crucial information about it.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.680]   So I'm absolutely going to agree with you.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.920]   We should have a forum where we can have that specific discussion.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.440]   And they have shown that they care about news.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.480]   But they're right, they're right, they're the problem.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   They've shown that they want it.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.960]   So, all right, so wait a second.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.400]   So imagine you're a Facebook executive is watching this right now and we're trying to
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.760]   convince them to enter in this discussion.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.640]   I know somebody's going to say, "Oh, screw it.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.800]   Why should I bother?"
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.280]   We're wildly successful.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.600]   We don't really need them effing.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.320]   And that's what I know is happening at various technology companies because that's our constant
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.920]   attitude is looking down our noses at them saying, "Oh, you just don't understand how
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:10.920]   to be important in society."
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.320]   I'm not looking down my nose at them.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.240]   I'm saying they have certain responsibilities.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.880]   Let's just play a good combat.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.840]   If they want to play in this field, Jeff, they have to accept responsibility.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.440]   Yes, I absolutely agree with you.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.080]   I just put the link up to my wrote a long piece about that and arguing exactly where.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.680]   But what I'm saying is they ended up accidentally in the news business.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:35.680]   They didn't...
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.560]   The news track was kind of intentional.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.440]   Well, it's true.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.440]   It is now...
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.040]   Well, at the beginning, they didn't want any of our news.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.920]   They wanted people's news, people's lives.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920]   They wanted all that.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920]   That's what it was.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.840]   We, the people, used it to link to stuff and that works well for them or works well for
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.840]   us.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.200]   Well, but as Matthew said, it's financially beneficial.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.200]   It engages people.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.440]   They stay on the site.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.120]   So Facebook says, "Good.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.120]   We like this.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.120]   Let's do more of this."
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.120]   Okay.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.120]   Here's the partner article.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.120]   Does...
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.120]   Answer this question.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.440]   Does Facebook have a civil responsibility, a civic responsibility?
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.440]   And they could say...
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.440]   And they could say...
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.240]   They could say...
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.520]   They could say that they don't.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.200]   They could say, "Listen, we are here to convince...
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.920]   You know, to get people dates.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920]   That's what we're here for.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.640]   The fact that you use it for news, not a lot.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.640]   We can't...
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.360]   As I say that, we can't expect them to fact-check the news.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.360]   That's fine.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360]   I expect a lot of other things.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.360]   And if they agree with...
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.320]   If they agree with your statement of their responsibilities and duties, then I am totally
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.920]   fine with having a relationship with Facebook.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.840]   But they have shown no sign that they agree with any of the things you said in a paragraph.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   That's where I disagree.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.400]   Have they shown that they care about what's factual and what's wrong with them?
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.400]   What's that?
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.360]   That's not their job.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360]   Neither is a Google's job.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.080]   You said it's part of their responsibility.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.080]   So, well, no, he says they shouldn't be expected to fact-check.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   It's not.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   No, they can't be expected to do that.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080]   Same as Google.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.560]   Google, let's go to Google.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.760]   Google has absolutely no responsibility to fact-check the world.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:06.280]   But they have a responsibility not to squelch any stories, right?
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.280]   They stand up for them.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   For political reasons.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.280]   Apparently not always, as much as they can.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   And when you challenge Facebook and when you challenge Facebook about them filtering things
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.240]   and excluding certain things, they throw up their hands and say, "Well, we don't do that.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.240]   You're doing that."
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.040]   You're, again, you're conflaking two different things.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.440]   When something stays in the system but what the feed doesn't show it to you, that's the
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.440]   algorithm.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.360]   When they take down something and kill it, that's different.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.160]   Those are two different things.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.640]   If you don't see that Beirut story...
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.640]   They're related.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:43.120]   No, not necessarily related at all because they may leave the Beirut story up but you
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.560]   never see it because you never otherwise care about news.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.040]   Now that was the answer that Facebook gave.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.840]   It was a bad answer.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.840]   We agree about that.
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:54.400]   Well, there is, by the way, there is a higher responsibility because Facebook runs the risk
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.560]   of being rejected as a news source by anybody intelligent.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.280]   In fact, I think it's perilously close to that.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.160]   I think that that's actually happening.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.400]   And so maybe they don't care about that.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   I don't know.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.280]   But I think if you say, "Well, we do want to be a news source.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.680]   We recognize that we are."
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:18.160]   Then they have a very high responsibility to make sure that they're not fudging the news.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   Right?
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   I agree with you.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.080]   They can't be held responsible for fact checking.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:26.680]   But they don't have to if the algorithm works right because you'll get all points of view.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.840]   Okay, let's put it another way.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.960]   Should they be responsible for news judgment?
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.720]   No.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:37.040]   That's exactly what Matthew is saying they are doing, which is they're pulling down articles
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.240]   they judge to be politically difficult.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240]   Right.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.240]   They are making huge judgments.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.000]   They are editing your view of the world.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.400]   This is the same, I'm telling you, the same article Jeff and I have had for years over
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.560]   Google, whether Google's making a judgment or it's just the algorithm.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   Well, the algorithm absolutely is.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.560]   They're designed by human beings.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.560]   Right.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.560]   That's a judgment.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.400]   When you let an algorithm, it's to wash your hands and say, "Hey, the computer did it.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.600]   What I didn't do it is really irresponsible."
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.040]   It's like an editor at the New York Times saying the guy who laid out the pages made the
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.040]   day.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040]   Hey, it's not my fault.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.480]   The press has did it.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.480]   It printed it that way.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.920]   Well, now it's the New York Times.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.760]   Nobody comes to our story.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.760]   Well, we can't.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:20.280]   What if newspapers said, "Oh, we don't choose what to show you.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.360]   We just show you what you want."
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360]   What you've already said.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360]   That's another thing, by the way.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.360]   Totally.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   That's totally.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.360]   And if you go down that road, you get local television news.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.160]   It's a total dereliction of duty.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   Right.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.360]   Like you've just basically given up any staff that have a responsibility.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:42.600]   I think though, Jeff's point, which I do credit is in individual niches, you're going to have
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.560]   all sorts of errors that you can't correct for, including things like choosing stories
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.880]   that the public wants to read as opposed to ones don't.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:56.800]   But that the modern internet gives the consumer of news so many variety of choices that they
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.720]   can find every story.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.960]   I think we're actually, I think we're actually in a golden age of news.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   I agree.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960]   I agree.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:09.760]   But the mistake would be to say, "Oh, well, Facebook is a...
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.440]   If that's your only source for news, you're getting what you deserve.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.680]   Just as if Channel 4 were my only source for news."
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.680]   Well, I agree.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.680]   I totally agree.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.280]   And people used to begin filter bubbles when they only read one newspaper.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280]   Right.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.000]   And everything you've said, Matthew, could apply to local television news, which frankly
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.800]   is where most people get their news.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.520]   That's why we're in this mess we're in in this country with a certain person leading
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.520]   the Republican Party.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520]   Yes.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.520]   Do you...
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.520]   Do you...
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.520]   Do you have not saying Facebook is the only one who has a responsibility?
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.520]   I think we have a responsibility as parents, as citizens.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   We have schools have a responsibility.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   Journalism schools have a responsibility.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.240]   I think it's not unfair to hold Facebook to a higher standard.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.160]   And I think we agree on that.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:53.040]   I mean, Matthew, you know, that after that moment, the journalism festival in Italy, which
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.080]   is going way back now, when Facebook gave what I thought was a bad answer, we both
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.080]   agree about that.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.280]   There should have been these are important and difficult questions that I need to have
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.560]   a discussion and let's figure out how to have that discussion.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.560]   But why should...
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.360]   Well, I want to hear discussions.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.360]   But they're never...
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.920]   But I'm telling you, there's no imperative for them to say that because just like Google...
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.440]   Well, not if every newspaper has given them 100% of their content already.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.360]   They don't have to talk about anything.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360]   This is...
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.360]   This...
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   But this is exactly the problem.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]   This is what I hear from my media people.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.200]   Oh, we're not even going to ask them because they'll say no.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.200]   Well, I'm going to go...
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.200]   I'm going to be there next week.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.200]   You know, ask them.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.200]   Please ask them.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:31.520]   But, frankly, they have a fiduciary responsibility to say no to you because they're...
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.240]   Mark Darrin asked before you gave them 100% of his content.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.280]   Did he say, could you talk about some of the ethical responsibilities?
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.040]   Their responsibility is to the stakeholders, the shareholders.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.640]   And I think the shareholders carry a little more weight than you do.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.360]   I'm sorry to say, Jeff.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.960]   Same when you're an NBC universal content.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:49.960]   I agree.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.560]   That's why ultimately it's...
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:57.600]   It has to come down to the individual's responsibility to seek out multiple sources.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.600]   Yes.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.600]   And there's never been...
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.600]   It's never been easier.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.680]   It has never been easier, but it's also never been harder.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.560]   I mean, it was easier when you could pick up two or three newspapers or magazines.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.560]   That didn't do it.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.560]   I could see 100 sources in five minutes.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.360]   I know a lot of people are overwhelmed by that amount of information.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.560]   Oh, that's why they go to Facebook in the first place.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.840]   Well, they deserve it then.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.080]   They should have it and keep it.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.480]   I mean, honestly, it's not Facebook's job to make sure we have an informed electorate.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.560]   I don't think that's asking too much.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.560]   I actually think...
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.280]   I'm a media walk and I'm bored by this discussion now.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.280]   Can we get some technology?
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.280]   I want to play before action now.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.960]   Well, that's about time.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.240]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.720]   We'll come back with other stuff like Google's mortgage shopping tool.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.280]   There's an interesting new business for Google.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.680]   Our show today brought to you by your friend Matthew, the folks at FreshBooks.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.880]   FreshBooks is an amazing site for people who are kind of self-employed or entrepreneurs
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:59.200]   or small businesses because they do the thing that you don't want to do, which is...
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.960]   those invoices every month.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:07.680]   Formatting, sending invoices, collecting receipts, tracking expenses, following up with late-pay
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.520]   clients, slow-pay clients.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.960]   That's not your business.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:16.320]   That's not what you got into business to do, but it is in fact a huge part of your business.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.420]   You don't do that.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:18.420]   You don't get paid.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   You don't get paid.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.420]   You don't get paid.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.320]   Maybe don't get new shoes.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.440]   The key is to find somebody who will help you do this.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.000]   This is a secret in business I've discovered.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.400]   Do this stuff you're good at and find somebody to do, somebody who's equally good at the
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.000]   stuff you don't want to do and have them do that.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.240]   FreshBooks is it.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.560]   They're the super simple cloud accounting solution that's giving thousands of freelancers just
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.720]   like you.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:45.920]   The tools to save time billing, to get paid faster, it makes formatting, sending invoices
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:50.980]   a breeze, automatic emails to people who don't pay you on time.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:56.820]   If you've got expenses and receipts and billable hours, all of that automatically handled by
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:02.860]   the incredible FreshBooks app, just take a picture of the receipt.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.660]   Now you can get paid up front.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:08.780]   FreshBooks has this new thing where you can request a deposit in FreshBooks so you don't
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:13.820]   have to cover costs out of pocket or wait until they end up project to get paid.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.840]   With FreshBooks Automated Customer Reviews report, you can see all your reviews in one
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.120]   place and post them on your website.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.160]   See they're adding more and more features all the time.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.720]   Of course, support from those great folks in Toronto, the FreshBooks Support Rock Stars

[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.040]   It's the best.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.720]   I'll tell you, they saved my life.

[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.980]   Tell them you heard it on this week in Google.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:51.980]   They are pretty great.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:57.340]   I'm not saying that just because Mike McDermott is a friend, but it's a great company.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.340]   I love them.
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.340]   I love them.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:03.300]   Your user support and their customer service is second to none.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:08.020]   I think all our advertisers should be from Canada.
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:10.700]   There's such nice people.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:11.700]   We knew this was coming.
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:12.700]   It just took them a lot longer.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:16.580]   Remember when we had the story probably a year ago that somebody who worked at Google
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.860]   had gotten a mortgage broker license, a realtor license?
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.860]   Right.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:28.440]   Well, finally, they've launched the mortgage shopping tool in California.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.740]   More states coming soon.
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:32.740]   They apparently have been doing this in the UK for some time.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:37.140]   They partnered with the Zillow and Lending Tree.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:41.020]   It'll pull data from lenders on Zillow's mortgage marketplace so they don't have to
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.860]   go directly to the lenders.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:48.780]   I think it's our sense that Google will be paid cost per lead on this.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.220]   This could be very...
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:52.220]   This is a profit center, right?
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.220]   Right.
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:55.940]   But I think we're going to get back into the antitrust argument that Google's in with
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:02.460]   shopping locations in the UK, where they've gone with a vendor, which is smart in this
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.460]   case, like in the tree.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.660]   But one of the other vendors is going to say, "I can just predict what's going to go."
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.660]   It's the same...
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:13.580]   It's kind of like that conversation we just finished, is that it's very hard because from
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.540]   a point of view of revenue, you want to do these things, but you have...
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:24.460]   It feels like a responsibility as Google to not money the waters here.
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.900]   I actually do believe that Google feels that.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:34.220]   I don't know that for a fact, but I think they do feel their size and their sort of
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:38.860]   the weight that they throw around in these markets that they do think about that.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:42.100]   And for all I know Facebook does too.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:43.100]   So that's funny.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:47.860]   Maybe there's no reason, but I always get the feeling that Google cares more than Facebook
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:48.860]   does.
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:50.980]   Maybe there's no basis for that.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:57.500]   And I would say, and I've said this before, my concern is not that Facebook is evil.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.620]   Mark Zuckerberg is a very nice guy.
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.780]   Lots of people I know at Facebook are very nice.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:07.500]   They're not trying to destroy anything or crush anything or take over anything.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:12.300]   My fear is that Facebook will accidentally destroy things.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.300]   And like a...
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.300]   Kind of like a...
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.300]   You know, a crush in your car accidentally.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:17.300]   It's very...
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:20.220]   It's sort of thing, not God help me to bring up what we just had.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:25.180]   But so I think that our responsibility is to help educate them.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.700]   And as a teacher, we don't best accomplish that by starting off by beating them over
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:30.700]   the head.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:33.300]   Let's say the elephant is coming.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.660]   Elephant is coming for you and it's going to step on you.
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.660]   Should you be executing elephant?
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.660]   Hey, down here.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:40.700]   Or you can't wait for you to be waving.
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.620]   Should you be waving your own sunscreen?
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.980]   We work in an odd little world.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:47.580]   We think we're just the most important thing in the world.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:51.700]   And you know, in a lot of lives we are not.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:55.100]   And there's a lot of other things for their businesses.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:30:01.500]   So I think that we need to take a slightly friendly role to say, listen, these are important
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.260]   things you probably haven't thought of it this way.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:05.020]   And let's try to figure it out together.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.780]   And I think it's possible.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.780]   But I'm optimistic.
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:12.900]   I'm mad at Google because instead of making something really cool, they made Google Glass.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:13.900]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:18.500]   Apparently, According to Time Magazine, Google made a secret prototype that works like the
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.500]   Star Trek communicator on your chest.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.700]   We're about that a while ago, actually.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.500]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.500]   They killed it.
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.020]   And they killed it.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:31.380]   It was a circular device with the built in microphone and Bluetooth allowed it to connect
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:33.620]   to a smartphone.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:40.300]   This actually was described to Time by a meets in Gal who was in charge of search.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:45.860]   The concept was intended to test out how users might interact with voice search in new ways.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.020]   When you wear it on your chest, you tap it.
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:52.300]   See they're obviously geeks because that's like, that's totally a Star Trek movie.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:53.500]   You tap your chest.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.460]   And you talk.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:56.460]   But isn't that cool?
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.460]   Wouldn't you have it in the second?
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:58.460]   Oh, I wanted so bad.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:01.620]   So golf said that I always wanted that pin.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.740]   You just ask it anything and it works.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.820]   That's why we were like, let's go prototype.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.820]   All it is.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:07.900]   We could you could do that.
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:12.860]   You could do that with a with a Arduino because all it is is a Bluetooth.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.020]   All they did was build a Bluetooth link to Google now.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.900]   It's an Amazon Echo on your chest.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:17.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.100]   You know, it's you know, it's funny.
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:24.340]   My daughter is a nurse in Hamilton and they have something very similar to that for inter
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.340]   sort of nurse communication.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.340]   So they tap it.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.340]   That's right.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.340]   They do.
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:31.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:35.540]   You can give commands so you can call something out and it actually you can you can turn on
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:36.900]   the humor setting.
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:42.420]   And so it will respond to you, you know, with, I don't know, Star Trek responses or things
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.660]   that are funny, but they use a lot.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:49.940]   Google will be texting you if you wish with holiday shopping deals.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:53.340]   If you don't have Thanksgiving, Matthew, how can you have Black Friday?
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:54.340]   Cheetah.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.340]   Cheetah.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:32:02.420]   Yeah, we have all the shopping related at the same time.
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.420]   Okay.
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.420]   What do they call it?
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:05.860]   It's not the day after Thanksgiving.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:06.860]   It's just Friday.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:07.860]   Yeah, Black Friday.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:08.860]   Black Friday.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:09.860]   All right.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.420]   That's what you guys call it.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.420]   Right.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:14.420]   And you watch our TV.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:15.420]   So you're kind of stuck with it.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.420]   Exactly.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.420]   We get them all anyway.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:22.060]   You might as well just move your Thanksgiving and get it over with you realize that, of
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.060]   course.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.060]   It's too close to Christmas.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.860]   I don't know how you guys put up with that.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:29.980]   It's terrible if you have a college student because Henry's home for Thanksgiving and
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:33.100]   like it two weeks is going to have to fly him back again.
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:38.900]   And if your family likes to have Turkey for both and you're not a fan of Turkey, say,
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.380]   you have to have it like two weeks after you just finished having your real agenda here,
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.380]   Matthew.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.380]   You don't like Turkey yet.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.580]   Well you could do a Christmas goose.
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:49.580]   True.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:53.460]   Canadian Canadian goose are quite delicious.
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:57.900]   Yeah, goose is Canadian geese are.
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.900]   What do we think of pie cake?
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.980]   Yeah, I'm willing to try it.
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:04.980]   I am.
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:05.980]   I'm definitely willing to try it.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.060]   I think that one that one might work.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.060]   What is it?
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.060]   A pie and a cake in one?
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.060]   It's a cake.
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.060]   It's made out of pie.
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:12.060]   Basically.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.060]   So there's layers of it.
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:15.060]   Let me think about this, how this would work.
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.100]   It's a so you got the go wrong.
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:19.180]   The New York Times caption for the picture.
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:20.420]   Is this the real life?
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:22.900]   Is this just fantasy?
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.420]   Lost in the lands.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:30.140]   I've heard about the camel version of Turducken.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:34.460]   Yes, of course, somebody in the chat room keeps telling me about it.
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:36.020]   Like that's pretty sure it's a pocryphal.
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:39.260]   I don't think that anyone has ever actually made it.
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:43.300]   Let's go look at the Wikipedia article.
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.780]   Whole stuffed camel.
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:46.300]   There's a picture of it.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:51.900]   Traditional Bedouin wedding dish like Turducken.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.620]   By the way, the recipe is in cookbooks.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:55.980]   It's often treated with skepticism according to Wikipedia.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:34:01.100]   I mean, I think it might be an exaggeration of a less impressive culinary experience.
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:08.620]   Snopes says that it is in fact a joke because of instructions like skin trim and clean the
[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:12.340]   camel once you get over the hump.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.980]   You know, I couldn't resist that either.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.980]   Cook eggs.
[01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:15.980]   Yes.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:16.980]   Cook works.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:17.980]   Cook eggs.
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:18.980]   Stuff eggs into fish.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:19.980]   Cook the fish.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:22.220]   Stuff the fish into cooked chickens.
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.740]   Stuff the cooked chickens into a roasted sheep.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.380]   Stuff the roasted sheep into a whole camel.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:28.540]   Now cooked to taste.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.740]   Serves 125.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:30.740]   That's disgusting.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:33.300]   That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.500]   I think someone should do it.
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:35.580]   Mythbusters should have done it.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:36.580]   The first are going up.
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:37.580]   That.
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.580]   Oh, man.
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:39.580]   No cruelty.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.580]   No camels here.
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.580]   Come on.
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:42.580]   No camels.
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:43.580]   Who cares about camels anyway?
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:44.580]   You don't like Facebook.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.580]   You don't like Turkey.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.580]   They're cruel.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.180]   Camels are among the meanest animals ever.
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.660]   They are pretty mean.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:51.660]   They'll spit.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:52.660]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.660]   I'd eat one.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:55.460]   Isn't it funny?
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:01.860]   Isn't it weird what animals we will eat and not eat like.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:02.860]   Docks and cats.
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:03.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:04.860]   What's wrong with a dog or cat?
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.540]   Eat other animals that size.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.540]   I've had horse.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.540]   It was pretty good.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.540]   Ooh.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:10.540]   Oster.
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:15.540]   I was in Africa two weeks ago in ostrich was they were very proud of having a certain ostrich.
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.540]   Was it good?
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:20.020]   I'll just say nothing but a bird.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020]   Sticky.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.020]   Pie cake and.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.020]   I've eaten insects.
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.180]   Three types of.
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:28.020]   I don't want to hear about story.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.020]   Three.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:31.740]   They were good.
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.740]   Were they candied?
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.420]   Chocolate covered bees.
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.420]   I've had chocolate covered ants.
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:38.140]   It's just crunchy.
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:39.500]   It's like there's a nut in there.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.660]   Like you don't even know.
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:41.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:48.940]   It has a formic acid and the acid it's hard to cut that flavor to matter how much chocolate
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.620]   you put on the air.
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:53.820]   But if you get used to it it's kind of nice because it's the sweet with a nice bite of
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.820]   formic acid.
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:36:01.180]   Actually someone was telling me that they figure in the future we'll all be eating bugs
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:05.220]   because there just won't be enough sort of regular food sources.
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:11.140]   You know cows use up so much land and their methane dispensers and bugs actually are pretty
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.140]   efficient.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.140]   No.
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:16.980]   Should eat lower on the food chain.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:18.980]   Pie cake and.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.500]   According to the New York Times the Journal of Records sorry Jeff.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:29.900]   Pie cake and has existed in underground dessert eating circles for some time.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:37.700]   But a recipe from pastry chefs at David Burke fabric in New York spent time this week on
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:44.140]   the daytime talk show circuit spiced pound cake with layers of pecan pie and pumpkin
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:51.260]   pie topped with upside down apple pie slathered on cinnamon buttercream and edged in oat
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:52.260]   trudel.
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:54.260]   I mean.
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:37:00.820]   Oh man that is that is just a heart attack in a in a wedge.
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:03.020]   It's almost dinner time here so I'm hungry.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:06.020]   Oh man sugar I'm going to sugar shock looking at it.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:09.580]   Yeah I know but it would be worth a try.
[01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:12.860]   Why not.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:17.820]   It's dessert turduck in my friends were I'm real tempted to spatchcock my turkey this
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:18.820]   year.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.660]   I thought that too actually it's a great way to do chicken.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:23.380]   I don't see why it wouldn't be a good way to do turkey.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:27.620]   You remove the spine and then you flatten the turkey.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.100]   So it looks like roadkill.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:33.300]   And then it cooks evenly because it's flat.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.300]   Oh.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.180]   It's a great way to do chicken.
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:37.180]   You've done it.
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.740]   It's like a brick chicken brick chicken.
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:41.740]   Yeah like brick chicken.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:42.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:43.740]   I'm which I love.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:46.260]   I really want to do it but I think that the wrong time to try new recipes Thanksgiving
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.460]   day I'm just saying.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.460]   Great.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:49.460]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.740]   Probably don't want to be there tomorrow afternoon saying hey I thought spatchcock
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.220]   would work.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.940]   Let's do it.
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:03.700]   I have been told though by an intrepid fan who went across the street that Petaluma
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:06.980]   markets butchers will spatchcock for you.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.880]   Hey.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.980]   It sounds illegal.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:11.980]   That's filthy.
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:14.740]   What I want to know is what are the all guns having.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.540]   Ah let's all go over there.
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.180]   I know Mike in a mirror man.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:19.180]   I'm sure it's amazing.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:20.620]   That homemade cheese I know that.
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:22.620]   Homemade cheese butter.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.620]   I've had some of her butter.
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:24.620]   It's very good.
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:25.620]   That sounds bad.
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.420]   I've had some of Mike's wife's butter and it's good.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.060]   Cheese looks great.
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.300]   That's relevant to me.
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.700]   Brie right or something like that.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.340]   Oh wow.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:37.340]   There you go.
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:38.340]   It's spatchcock in your turkey.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.340]   Much unknown.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:40.340]   There you go.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:50.860]   So Google has a subscription to Black Friday deals.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:57.020]   It was in a Google plus post because so no one saw it.
[01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:04.340]   So here you go if you want to get the relative relevant holiday offers and updates.
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:05.580]   See forget circulars.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:08.380]   I've got texts from Google.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:13.980]   Holiday shopping is on the horizon to ease blah blah blah.
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:15.060]   So okay.
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:16.940]   Here you go folks.
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:20.380]   I presume this is US only but maybe it's worldwide.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:29.260]   If you want Black Friday deals text the word join to 847 904 0608.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.100]   Is this Google itself really?
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:39.700]   For Cyber Monday press 847 906 89 5 8.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.580]   For holiday deals.
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:45.900]   This is the new circular 847 904 059 6.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.340]   That's the end of the newspapers.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:48.340]   There you go.
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:49.340]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:50.340]   Go ahead.
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:51.340]   I'll let you.
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.340]   Jason will do it.
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:53.340]   You got a phone there Jason?
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.340]   You get Larry.
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.340]   Hi this Larry page.
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:57.340]   What can I leave a message?
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:05.340]   I'm your new Santa Claus.
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:07.260]   847 904 0608.
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:17.420]   I'm sure you can text stop to it if you don't want to be more.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.660]   They'll tell you what you can text.
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:24.420]   So it tailors promotional message to products you're interested in because remember Google
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.660]   knows what you're interested in.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:28.940]   Oh, when you've been looking for a guy who knows if you've been naughty.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.860]   That Amazon knows if you've been nice after subscribing the phone number will remain private
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:36.340]   and of course you can opt out at any time.
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:42.100]   Let's say for example the consumer searches for Black Friday deals and subscribes from
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:43.900]   the ad below.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:46.500]   It's ringing.
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.380]   Yeah, it's coming up as a weird number.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:52.020]   Yeah, because it's it's it's routing us to Germany.
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:53.020]   Oh, great.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.780]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.020]   Who posted this?
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.020]   Adwords.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:58.020]   Okay.
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:40:59.020]   All right.
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:03.460]   I'm going to do it on my phone.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:04.460]   What the heck?
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:07.060]   But while I'm doing that, let's talk about something else because I don't want to show
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.060]   you.
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:10.820]   Will it show you the hard drive that you were shopping for that you actually bought a week
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:11.820]   ago?
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:12.820]   Will it continually?
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:13.820]   Yes.
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:15.700]   That's the problem with recommendation engines is they're dumb.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:19.580]   But if anybody could do it right, it'd be Google, right?
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.020]   It would be it would be so well.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:25.780]   The first thing that's so simple to fix is just put a frequency cap on those damn dads.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:27.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:33.500]   Like if you've seen it 15 times, but you know, everybody who does advertising knows that
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:38.940]   there is a correct number of impressions beyond which you do not want to go because
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:41.260]   well, that's brandy advertising.
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:44.380]   This is commerce advertising, which costs almost nothing.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.380]   So they say, let's let's let's her arrest them.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.380]   Oh, I get it.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:51.380]   So the networks should have this is one of the discussions we had at Newsgeist is and
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:55.380]   I want to do an event on this acuity is we need to start setting advertising quality
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:56.380]   standards.
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:57.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.380 --> 01:42:01.660]   This is the beginning of this from Google amp actually does set some irritation standards
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:04.740]   and the interactive advertising bureau does it, but you need to go farther with things
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:10.300]   like how these ads behave, what data they gather, how they act on it.
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:11.300]   We've got it.
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.300]   The publishers don't start improving this.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.860]   The advertisers never will.
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:20.820]   So you know what, Leo, if I go to the ad words account on Google+, I don't see that
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:21.820]   post.
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:23.580]   Oh, you think it's fake?
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:27.500]   Just making sure you think I'm going to spend a lot of money on this?
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:30.300]   Why would someone fake something so boring?
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:36.100]   Because maybe you get your device now if I click it, it's Oh, Oh, it is fake.
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.900]   Look how Google is spelled.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:39.860]   Oh
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:49.420]   It has 2.5 million followers that pisses me off
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:52.900]   It's got five times the number of followers I do
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.440]   Is this on Google plus yeah?
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:56.900]   Wow
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.900]   that seems
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:04.520]   that they're in there impersonating at words, that sounds is it
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:09.940]   I mean, it's got three o's. I don't know but I'm not finding it if I try to go it's got three o's in it
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.740]   That's that's that's not you go to the top. It's got two point five million dollars
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:19.100]   And it's called that this is the hell out of me go back to the lab and allow that go back to that post
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:23.200]   Okay, okay, what what's the what do you mean the URL should I
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:29.400]   Account name in it. No, it says plus Google ads. Yes plus Google ads. Oh
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:35.360]   Okay, well, that should be it. Yeah, okay. Maybe I'm wrong. Why would Google be spelled with three?
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.900]   Yeah, I don't know. Well, so there's I think they got plus Google ads. I think let's report this guy
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:45.200]   I don't know and by the way this article comes from search engine land
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:50.720]   Well, I love this is charges apply right you call Germany. There's gonna be people getting charged for that
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:57.360]   The only thing I'm saying is I can't find the post on my own. I just don't know. Yeah, no search for plus Google ads
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.940]   It's not called adwords. I don't know how you do that, but some of their I don't see it
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:07.240]   Well, I do
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.560]   It's an old post
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.800]   How old oh, oh?
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:19.400]   Two weeks ago. Oh well, okay, so maybe that's it. All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna do it anyway
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:24.600]   Called Germany how no, I'm not gonna call him. I'm gonna text him. How expensive could that be?
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:28.600]   and
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:32.840]   Can you can you put up the numbers? No, no now
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:39.780]   Can you show the page? Oh, yeah, go ahead show it so this checking because I'm looking at the page for seven or they're all eight four seven area
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:42.520]   Code who's that where's that? Yeah, those are the right numbers
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:49.780]   The search engine land wrote about it. Yeah, maybe they were fooled like I found it. Maybe they were fooled like we were
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:56.080]   Oh, I got it November 10th, but they talked to Google about it. Let's maybe all right. Maybe all right
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.880]   I'm I'm so panicked. But why are there three o's in the
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:04.080]   Maybe that's how you spell it in Blurmany
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:11.400]   Well, and the search engine land article links to that Google Plus post right that's how I got there. I followed the post
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.280]   You think it's all right
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:17.560]   Otherwise, we're gonna have to edit this entire section at the podcast
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:20.240]   Yeah, I'm not seeing the Google with three o's
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.240]   You have to click the
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:27.120]   Click AdWords, okay, and then it takes you to their
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.280]   Thing and then below it
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:33.000]   There's the goo
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.160]   You could show that that's okay Jason I know
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.800]   Yeah, this looks legit
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:45.680]   Yeah, I probably I just I all I said was I couldn't find the post by what definition of legit
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.520]   Yeah, the three o's is odd I
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:54.680]   Don't get that at all apparently. I don't know how to use hangouts. I'm having a hard time I
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:09.920]   Don't understand how hangouts works and all the links are Google links Google.com slash AdWords
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.840]   Yeah, so it's real see I wouldn't lie to you
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.840]   I
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:20.080]   Thought we had a juicy scandal going there. Oh
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:26.440]   It's my Google circles I spelled it wrong. Oh, it's my fault
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:31.720]   Yeah, I got Google errors
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:35.800]   Oh, oh, yeah
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.360]   That's me
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360]   Now we're really editing it out
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.500]   Apparently I've already been I was following them all along
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:48.760]   In my Google
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.560]   Circle
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:54.640]   Stop laughing at me. All right
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:01.720]   Don't judge me I did that on purpose because I thought it was funny right Google
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:08.040]   So apparently not only do I not know how to use hangouts. I don't know how to use Google Plus
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:12.240]   Now what are only half a million people follow me or I was pal
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:14.240]   I'm an idiot
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:22.080]   I'm an idiot good news if you if you use Android pay this month you'll be helping Google donate up to a million dollars
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.560]   toward education
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.420]   This is a smart. This is the kind of thing that's that works every it's a win-win
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:35.360]   Google obviously wants people to start using Google pay because there's kind of a hurdle the first time you use a you know
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.400]   Tap to pay solution. It's in the first time's a scary. Will they laugh at me?
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:47.200]   Well, they think I misspelled Google in my spare time with a clear click at me like I'm trying to steal this candy bar
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:48.600]   so
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.760]   Here they go. They say look if you use good Android pay we're gonna donate a
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.920]   dollar
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.360]   To a different organizations up to a million dollars
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.360]   Each time an Android pay purchase is made through the end of the year
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.400]   Google donate one dollar to donors choose or I guess donors chooses
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.240]   Supporting is a great
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:18.280]   Yeah, yeah, it's a good charity and it will help the children in the US education system with special needs and it will double
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:22.040]   The donation at two bucks if you do it on black Friday
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:26.280]   So call eight four seven nine zero eight
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:33.080]   All or text no, I'm just I'm joking that was the other
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:41.200]   Being you know Google has three O's. Did you know that? I think if people commonly think it only has two we've misspelled it
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.040]   Yeah, they changed it. We got to put another O in there, would you?
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:53.960]   There's a little word you out smart yourself
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:58.280]   LG canceled the European
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:04.520]   Yeah, it was actually for sale for I know 18 you could have go to 18 t-star and get it
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:08.040]   Was it like instant cancer on your wrist? I mean what what the heck?
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:11.960]   Unexpected complex hardware issue
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:16.280]   That work
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:23.440]   Yeah, they got a team team I think team ovelers maybe sprint they got because it this was the LG
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:31.120]   Urbain second edition that had LTE built in I have the first edition air bay and actually kind of like it's nice Android Wear watch
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.400]   And this one was gonna have a phone number of sim card
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.560]   You still have to have a phone
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.800]   But you didn't have to always have it with the phone and it could take and receive phone calls and so forth
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.000]   They decided to cancel
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.880]   the rollout of the urbane second edition due to a complicated nature of the
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.960]   hardware issue
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.200]   Which affected the day-to-day functionality?
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:00.120]   Whether the device this is from LG whether the device will be available in the future will be decided at a later time
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.240]   Sounds like no
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.520]   That's that's got to be a huge hit
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:13.000]   Mm-hmm get that close a week from ship date or something. Oh wasn't in the market yet
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.000]   You could go I think you could go and get it, but you don't know if you'd get it
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.360]   That's what whatever does anybody actually have it. Yeah, I don't know does anybody have one
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360]   Hmm
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:29.640]   Hmm
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:34.080]   You do is it a big deal that YouTube is going to go to the
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.040]   Ropes and defend video makers
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:42.280]   Who are I think that is a big deal actually issue with takedowns
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:48.360]   I think it's interesting that they're doing that and I'm in favor of it. I mean the more help
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:57.360]   That that those types of creators can get there's lots of you know fake DMCA takedowns or sort of denials of service based on
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:02.920]   DMCA takedowns that have no merit. It's nice to see somebody with a little bit of you know weight
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.360]   Sort of standing up for that kind of yeah
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.920]   They're not actually going to go to court for you, but they'll help fund your fight
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:18.440]   It'll pick up the legal costs of a small number not a lot of video creators that the company things are targets of unfair takedown demands
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:27.120]   Because typically what happens is they they just they file so many and Google is required by right say farmer
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:35.200]   Clause they have to take it down and so stuff is gets taken down all the time and there's no merit to those DMCA takedowns at all
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:43.960]   Leo can you find the original post because it has some really interesting comments underneath it or the blog was the original Google post
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:48.280]   Yeah, and said when I read this at the time and I can't find it it said
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:52.320]   That there are some other things that you can do Google
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:52:01.480]   For example, I think one thing is that if a takedown notice comes the money never gets back to the person even if they win the takedown notice
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:06.960]   Was as I recall there were a few other things that they say you know thanks Google is nice, but
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:12.640]   There's a few other things you could do that would just really change because what's happening is people are obviously gaming
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:15.040]   This terribly the other one is a three strikes problem
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.240]   So what happens is a company uses three different entities owned by the same company
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:25.160]   File three complaints gets person and they are three strikes right there and down and then the money doesn't flow to them
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:32.160]   And then even if they win they've gone through this whole McGill and they don't get the money back. So as an example this UFO theater
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:40.680]   Which is a channel dedicated to bunking sightings of UFOs only has a thousand subscribers. He takes the
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.200]   fake UFO footage and
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:50.640]   Post it and the bunk seat and he's getting takedown notices from the original creators of those phony videos
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:54.840]   It's what it's fair comment absolutely fair comment. Yeah. Yeah, and that's what Google's saying
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:58.440]   We're gonna they're gonna particularly focus on fair use for commentary or news
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:01.320]   Which is by the way how we use stuff as well
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:05.440]   Well and Google itself has benefited from fair use
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:11.560]   I mean the whole Google books ruling was based on the idea that Google book banning is effectively fair use and benefit
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:17.520]   I found okay, so it's nice to give them see them giving back. It's only four. It's only four creators right now
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:22.440]   I would love to see this expanded though. Mm-hmm. I just put it in the right. I put that post in the rundown. Okay
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:25.000]   Because it says
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.240]   You look at Mike. This is a great start. However a
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:35.160]   Far more effective change will be to remove the immediate monitor reward for a false claim as it stands now
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:39.280]   The instant the claim is made all add money is diverted to the claimant
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:43.240]   Right and is never recoverable by the creator. I had no idea. This is the case
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:49.440]   This is further compounded by the fact that appeals go to the claimant not a third party. Hey
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:56.440]   You said that I wasn't that I was I was not legit. Yeah, I want to appeal that I still say you're not legit
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:54:01.240]   And I keep the money so there's a moral hazard. There's a gaming problem here. That's bad
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:03.560]   a
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:10.440]   Simple change would be once a claim is made against a video to hold escrow all revenue until the dispute is resolved or one party fails to
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.440]   Respond in a given time
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:19.160]   Last a strike should not be issued while a DCMA DMCA counter notice is pending
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:26.000]   It is far too easy in the current system for a claimant to make multiple claims at once and carpet bomb a channel to three strikes
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:33.520]   I personally been hit by Nintendo at least three times the strikes on multiple videos at once because Nintendo uses multiple accounts
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:37.480]   Really smart stuff there. I had no idea. This was the case
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:44.680]   And the comments know that the revenue part I didn't either and so I'd take Mike and his word here who are Mike is
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:48.280]   But the others in the comments kind of said yeah, what Mike says
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.320]   Update on that LG
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:55.320]   LTE watch issue according to the telegraph
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:02.800]   And LG rep told them for competitive and supplier relations reasons we can't communicate the specifics however
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:06.420]   We can share the hardware issue is related to a new advanced
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:15.560]   Component we had incorporated into the device that had never been used in LG wearable device before during aggressive testing over thousands of hours
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.560]   it was revealed that
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:25.260]   the component failed to meet our quality standards and could potentially impact our image quality over the life of the device so it's some
[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:28.240]   Some display thing screen probably yeah, yeah
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:40.200]   It was the it was gonna be the first smartwatch to use a 480 by 480 display
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:46.420]   Which would OLED display which means it would be 490 pixels an inch is very high-res display
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:52.800]   So eventually battery life with between that and having to have a cell in it well, it's pretty good
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.120]   But yeah, I think the cells are the radios a bigger issue
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:59.480]   Plus yeah, I'm not I use
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:02.760]   phones all the time
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.520]   I'm not a paranoid about the radiation however wearing
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:10.800]   And antenna all that radio all the time. I don't know yeah
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:17.480]   Google has my pocket but I guess that was according to a search engine land
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:23.180]   Google has received more than 65 million takedown requests in a month
[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:26.040]   Yeah, like two million a day
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:28.680]   Jesus
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:36.440]   Attack the week of November 19th. Yeah, the week of November 19th. They got 15
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:43.680]   0.6 million takedown requests based on copyright infringement look at the graph. It's only going up
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:47.880]   You're up
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:54.360]   No, this isn't a right to be forgotten. Oh, this is this is copyright. This is DMCA
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:02.400]   Hollywood Hollywood or anybody that's the problem. Sorry. Don't give me I bump your pee is all come after me
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:06.600]   You mean to Europe stop one place. Okay. I'm sorry. It's Hollywood this time. It's us
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.480]   We actually don't know what it is
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:18.960]   They received 60 in the last one 65 million URL copyright removal requests for 72,000 different domains from a mere
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:22.160]   5492 copyright owners so
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.720]   less than
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:27.560]   1,000 people spawn 65 million
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:31.560]   takedown requests the previous discussion about YouTube
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:34.200]   That's a lot of lawyers
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.480]   That means a thousand a month per
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:41.640]   Copyright holder. No 10,000 a month
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:45.240]   What the what
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:49.880]   That's more than 10,000 a month from each individual
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:54.280]   Copyright holder that means they have automated tools too right there going
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:58.360]   The responsibility was put on there just incentive
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:06.360]   Right. There's no dissidenting a million. Why not right? That's why I'd as well. Yeah, maybe that's what spurred this
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.920]   Yeah, they really uh, there should be a slap
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:12.280]   some sort of slap penalty. That's what they call it when the
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:18.840]   slap laws protect you over in the old days of dial-up modems and I ran a
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:23.960]   You know a snipper that would see if anybody was trying to get into my network and then what number one thing
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:27.400]   They used to happen was called an icon upon reachable storm
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:34.200]   I cmp and would just basically flood your computer with requests tings to respond. It's like hey, are you there?
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:36.680]   It's a ping yeah, yeah too many things
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:42.680]   Eventually your computer would become yeah non-functional. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hello
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:47.720]   It's a sin sin flood too same thing for a website. Same exact idea
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:50.920]   Um
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:53.480]   Let me see. I'm just looking see make sure I got everything in here
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:57.720]   Mark Zuckerberg is going to take two months off when the baby comes good for him. Yeah
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:01.080]   He's gonna teach him how to hunt elk
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:08.040]   The other one I I probably don't want to say it on here the uh story of a fake name fuktat bish
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:15.000]   Oh that you just knew I just I you know why I looked at it. I thought should I share this? No, no
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:20.440]   This is well, it's an interesting story. So he claims that's his real name. It's a vietnamese name sort of no
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:25.080]   No, it's not it's a hoax. Isn't it? He's gonna get to that. Yeah. Yeah, it's hoax. That's how it's out
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.480]   Yeah, we knew it was
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:31.640]   Yeah, it was but it was so obvious, but boy, it's even the even the doctor driver's license
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:37.720]   It was so obviously photoshopped it being the fonston match fonston match exactly and look at all the places that shared that story
[01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:43.240]   I yeah, all the sort of allegedly well all you have to do is look at the paris attacks to see how
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:46.760]   For fevered
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:56.760]   the need to get link clicks is and the need to speculate of course you know that cnn's gonna fill 20 hours or I guess now it's more like a hundred hours of
[01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:01.320]   Empty coverage with speculation. What else are they gonna say they don't have any information
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:05.160]   But what really saddens me is the number of good
[02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:09.800]   Journalists who reported things like oh
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:16.760]   PlayStation 4 was used by the terrorists or oh the terrorists were using telegram. No, they weren't
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:21.160]   Uh, I kind of fell for it. Although I was a little suspicious of the wired story
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:23.880]   uh about the uh operational
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:27.640]   communications and operational security manual
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:30.920]   Uh the folks at west point found
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.640]   I didn't see that one. They claimed now. I'll get it for you and we'll show you
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:40.120]   Opps say was I supposedly isis is Oppsec manual
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.560]   Isis Oppsec manual gives
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.640]   Security manual reveals the Oppsec advice isis gives to recruits
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.240]   Uh and the and the story came from west point
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:54.360]   Where there's a apparently they have a security research
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:59.720]   Even when I talked about this story on sunday on the twit I said this I would like to know the provenance of this
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:01.720]   Was this not true? Oh
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:05.000]   It was not a real man. It was a real man. Oh, no. It was a real manual
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:07.480]   uh created by um, what was it?
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:09.640]   an irish company
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:16.280]   Um, it was not created by this was comes from the the the researchers came from the this is actually a giveaway
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:23.480]   Combating terrorism center at west point. That's real by the way, but I I think maybe they have an investment
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:26.280]   in this
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:31.880]   The uh guide was originally written a year ago by a kuwaiti security firm cybercov
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:38.520]   For get this journalists and political activists in gaza on how to protect their identities
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:41.320]   Okay, and the entity of their sources
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:48.360]   But isis has co-opted it well, I'd like to know I'd like to hear about that
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:53.400]   Yeah, it also turns out isis doesn't have 24-hour help desks never did
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.320]   Well, let's remember that they I mean a lot of the people
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:03.000]   Working for this movement are fairly sophisticated. They may be disinformation there
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.520]   Exactly. They left a syrian passport. Right that appears to be fake because they were trying to shift blame
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:14.120]   You know, they they've thought this stuff through it's they're really good. Yeah, came up with it on this part of the moment
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:20.360]   Somebody the charmers says I don't think isis has a pr department. Oh, yes. They do. Oh, they do. No, in fact if you look at the vice
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:22.840]   um
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:25.480]   Interviews with isis on scene
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:33.160]   The the interview's role with the guy who does their pr. Yeah, they literally have very good at it. Yeah, not not only that
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.760]   But very good at social media. They're very good at manipulating obviously manipulating the press
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:39.640]   So uh calm down
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:45.080]   Everybody but you're right it comes out of this this desire for it's it's a business model problem
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:47.560]   I want more volume more traffic. Maybe
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:51.800]   I think that's part of it. I think i'm not sure that's all of it though
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:56.120]   I mean, I know it's all about this but it's we're motivated to go for media traffic
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:59.880]   My the most ridiculous example I've heard the daily beast. I don't know if you saw this
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:07.160]   Briefly turned to the chicago shooting tape yesterday into an animated gift. Oh lord
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:08.920]   Right
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:11.640]   What what what reflux makes you do that? Yeah, well
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:15.320]   Pull the box fix you want click exactly exactly
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:21.320]   Uh actually I think you can even defend it. Well, this is a good way to get uh get this onto twitter and get more people to see it
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:27.560]   But it's yeah, I suppose show the worst sort and I think that the the media's desire to talk to cover
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:33.240]   this uh security and the isis and all this stuff is not necessarily purely
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.720]   Financial, I think there's a drive to
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:40.520]   I also think if you look at the just look at your your twitter feed. I looked at my twitter feed
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:46.680]   There were lots of journalists sharing things that had not been verified because there was a lot of breaking news happening
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:51.960]   Right now a lot of people knew what was going on there weren't and there wasn't anybody inside the bat a clan and so on
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.800]   So you have the all the things that used to happen in a newsroom
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:02.760]   Before a story was published is now happening out in the open in front of everyone and a lot of it is wrong and a lot of it is chaos
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:08.760]   And a lot of it is just sort of you know people are passing things on right because they are trying to help
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:12.280]   And yet in many ways they're not helping because they're not checking
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:16.920]   And I want to really hold ourselves to a higher standard at least with technology stuff
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:21.160]   Uh because one of the reasons reporters get that stuff wrong is because they don't understand or they don't
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:25.400]   I mean that's you know, they're they're in a foreign area for them
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:31.800]   And there are some groups out there that are doing excellent work storyful is one of them doing sort of real time fact-checking
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:37.400]   Remazing stuff. Yeah. Yeah, and and that's you know, I do everything I can to try and pass those
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:42.440]   Weets and messages on when they say something is fake or something hasn't been verified. Yeah
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:47.480]   Another team of researchers at work that is by the way the new
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.160]   authorities say
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:53.160]   four out of five doctors
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.880]   Team of researchers is the new
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:59.000]   Well must be true
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:04.440]   Team of researchers did a tear down of google's nest camera and discovered that even if you turn it off
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:07.880]   It's still working
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.920]   They examined the security cam's power consumption including
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:16.200]   That when the nest cam is turned off via the app the led light goes off, but the device
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:21.880]   Continues to draw 340 milliamps. What doesn't still transmit?
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:26.360]   Right, it's just a made may be doing that so as an instant on
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:32.520]   Many of your devices went off still draw power because when you turn them on you won't curse them
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:36.920]   Particularly long to come on and so there you go. There's the intelligent response
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:40.520]   to the link bait headline from kizmoto
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:47.000]   Yeah, yeah, it doesn't turn off. It's in true. It's true. It doesn't mean it's watching you
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:53.640]   Surprised they didn't have a big brother. They kind of did they had here
[02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:58.360]   I'll show you show you the they had a picture of these nests staring at me with a little light on like
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.680]   Oh, we're watching
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.920]   We're watching you we're google and we like to watch
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:08.360]   Like chauncee the gardener. I like to watch
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:14.280]   All right, let's take you guys go ahead. Yes, bring up something new because I I've run out of stories
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:18.200]   You guys already talked about the app search thing. Yeah, we did last week
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:23.480]   And it just had been announced last week, but uh, so we didn't really fully and I don't know if we do now yet
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:28.760]   Fully understand what google's doing and the idea is when you do a search. Let's say for hotels in kambridge
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:35.160]   Uh, it will not only give you you know traditional website links, but it will search within apps like hotels tonight
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:38.600]   To find you don't have the app you don't have to have the app. It's
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:42.440]   It's so they've got basically virtual machines running
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:47.560]   Every app you can think that's what we were trying to figure out is how do they do the ones that consent to it?
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:53.240]   By the way importantly the ones in there isn't their interest to consent. Yeah, it's just a handful that shows you effectively
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:56.440]   This is actually probably pretty good marketing for those apps. Yeah
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:03.240]   And it comes from a Nelson item like oh, that's cool the analogy I use I wish they do with podcasts
[02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:08.840]   Yeah, that's a good idea. Right. Well, it's two parts to it though. So so we first off
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:14.120]   The content within that is accessible within the app is exposed to search
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:18.120]   So you can search on something that is in fact in an app. That's a big deal
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:21.320]   It would be like the content of the podcast and all of our blathering words
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:23.880]   Yep to be searchable and discoverable through search
[02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:29.560]   Then once you discover it if you don't have the app then they needed the way to display that content to you by
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:33.320]   mimicking the app and so both things are very important
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:36.680]   Yeah, and then I think it's a fantastic. Oh, I love it
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:42.040]   It's also a solution for the problem and we talked about this in news guys brand view about
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:46.360]   Paid content that you have places built
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:48.920]   Australia publications
[02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:50.920]   Washington Post New York Times whoever
[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:57.400]   Some of these publications complain that their content doesn't come up in the search or in Google news because it's too little
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:00.920]   Picked on by enough people because it's paid and so it's behind a wall
[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.200]   So if you could expose it up
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:07.800]   Number one and then number two say oh listen Matthew
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:09.480]   I know Matthew subscribes to that paper
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:12.920]   I'll go ahead and expose that content to him because he's already shown he likes it
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:16.600]   And then he can get to get a wormhole to it
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:18.920]   I would sign of
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:24.200]   What a jr. newspaper that has a paywall on google to go inside it's a happens to be by permission
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:30.040]   There are yes, and they're begging for it. Oh interesting really. Yes, huh for just this reason
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:34.600]   Um, they're saying you should be exposing our content especially to our own users
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:40.280]   Can I beg on behalf of the podcast industry which by the way is going through a big renaissance right now google
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:42.840]   I've heard that
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.840]   Huge it's huge
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:48.760]   Uh, so just a little plug. I mean if you it would be easy to do
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:53.560]   There's automated systems that can listen to the podcast transcribe it add it to your search index
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:58.600]   All you have to do is have a little you know put it in the search result have a little player there press play
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:04.200]   You don't even have to do video for us. Just audio would be fine. Yep. Just saying it's a great idea
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:11.000]   The podcast revolution you could you could be a big helper there. They're already doing that conversation with anybody up there
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.320]   I don't know anybody up there
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:16.360]   I think I know anybody
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.680]   So stay here in my little hawful

[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:08.120]   Um, anybody have any picks or anything? Matthew something you're excited about these days
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:12.120]   Actually, I have something that's kind of interesting since we're talking about search
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:16.280]   Um, I just wrote about it was it yesterday? I forget now
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:23.080]   Um, but I don't know if you remember michael robertson. Yeah found no, he has a new thing. I saw he sent me a note. Yeah
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:25.640]   Uh, so it's called on radio
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:28.360]   And it's basically a radio search engine
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.240]   Which is fascinating
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:33.240]   He was a founder of mp3.com
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:39.240]   mp3.com and then mp3 tombs and then sued out of existence by the music industry
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:43.320]   It's horrible not only they sue him to the point where he couldn't make money
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:48.840]   Then they bought the company at pennies on the dollar. They're just right horrible people and he's a great guy. I really like him
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:54.280]   And he created he created linspire which was originally right windows. Right. Um, so
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:57.000]   on radio basically built a
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:03.800]   A crawler that index is what's playing on a hundred thousand different radio stations. Wow. Just so you know folks is on
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:07.640]   red dot IO. Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:10.440]   I owe who owns that domain? I wonder
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:18.440]   Anyway, um, so it's I tried it out. It's it's pretty interesting. He said the problem with radio is discovery
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:24.920]   You just don't what's playing where right? So your favorite station. Maybe that you go and check it out. Oh, it's not gonna like this
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:29.320]   You can you can find a song playing on any radio station
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:31.720]   Just about anywhere and just click and play it
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:37.880]   So like the adele album which she won't let on streaming music services. Well, of course radio is playing it
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.520]   exactly
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.040]   Wow there she is adele
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:50.680]   By the way, I love adele. I wish she'd find a good man though so she could stop writing breakup songs
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.560]   She could sing
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:58.600]   It's actually a link
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:01.720]   Yeah, nbc's taking it down
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:06.040]   They have to go down. Yeah, her dry vocals from setter at live. Yeah
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:09.480]   And she did a version with jimmy
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:12.200]   Fallon. Yeah, that's a good one too with this
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:15.480]   They're all playing toys. Yeah, they do that little thing and they don't put that on the sheet
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:18.600]   You know, it's interesting. We were watching adele's appearance on phallen
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:23.240]   And it's not on that that's something they do later. Is she the web?
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:28.760]   The roots get together in the dressing room. They all have children's instruments, you know school instruments
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:34.840]   And uh, the first one I saw was uh carl carly ray jeffson called me. Maybe it was so good
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:37.480]   They made me love the song. I never there was one
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:41.880]   Alan thix son robin
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:44.520]   Yeah, little robin
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:48.840]   His his big hit. I can't remember the name. It looks like they're sitting in a closet. Yeah
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:55.160]   The little toys. Yeah, and by the way, she knocks it out of the park on that too
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:59.800]   She does. I mean not easy to do when the guy next to shaking a plastic banana rattle
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.320]   But she gives it her all
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:07.640]   She's a hack up a singer. So anyway on radio. I thought it was interesting
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:14.760]   Anything michael does is interesting. He just seems to have like a hundred ideas like this that he's always working on. Yeah
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:19.560]   He's uh, he's a interesting story. We had him on triangulation and um
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:22.520]   Gosh, he's been so close so many times in there
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:24.840]   He thinks he keeps doing it with music. He has it
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:30.760]   It's like the record industry just slaps him down and he does something else and then these and then lindows and he gets sued for that
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:35.480]   It's like the energizer bunny though. Yeah, it doesn't stop or stop. This is a really good idea
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.760]   So I mentioned in the down at the bottom of the post
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:44.520]   We talked a bit about the google books ruling because google books ruling effectively says
[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:47.640]   google scanned all these millions of books which
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:50.840]   Technically is a huge infringement of copyright
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:55.960]   But the court ruled that the sort of social value of doing that I weighed the infringement
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:58.280]   And I was wondering what if the mp3
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:00.760]   Case was heard now
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:07.720]   One of the one of the key parts of the case was the feature that called beam it that allowed you to say I have this cd
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:12.600]   And then listen to all those songs from the cloud because he had ripped a whole bunch of cds
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:16.200]   Which is not that different from what google did with google books?
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:22.040]   Except it was you know 10 years ago or whatever and and the way people looked at fair use and copyright was very different
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:25.320]   I wonder what would have happened if that case happened that question
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:32.040]   On our o n r a d dot i o
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:34.840]   And of course these are all internet
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:39.720]   I mean they're real radio stations. They're internet radio stations right internet versions of them. Is that right?
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:42.440]   So what's good about that is
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:47.960]   That these radio stations do pay their askep bmi fees. They are royalties being paid
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.640]   This is not you know some sort of free writing thing
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.600]   But as you pointed out with with adele
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:57.240]   The same reason
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:02.600]   She shows up in pedora is the same reason it right she shows up here because radio has a compulsory license
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:06.360]   Right so they they get to play whatever they want anything they want
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:09.960]   Because it's non-interactive
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:16.920]   You know what's sad about that is that the askep bmi fees benefit the publishing right there for publishing rights the writer
[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:22.040]   Not the artist. They're not mechanicals. Although doesn't she write all her own songs?
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:28.760]   I believe she I think she might believe she co writes them. Okay. I don't know that she writes them. She probably co writes them so she gets paid
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:32.360]   Interesting. I was just looking at this the other day
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:35.720]   um, this is a sort of related but
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:40.040]   Zoe Keating who's a Canadian challenge. Yeah
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:42.280]   Yeah, cellist and there was another
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:47.480]   Artist who I'm trying to remember we're talking about using the blockchain as a way of effectively
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:50.040]   Oh right. Yeah, it was just
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.840]   That's a great idea. It was the other it was just today just today just this week. I mean
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:59.960]   But that's a fascinating idea because the blockchain can effectively track
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:07.240]   You know exactly where tracks are it can build in payment imaging or heap. Oh, I love imaging heap
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:12.920]   Yeah, she's great. So she's a sign music. I mean, she's a signed artist. She's not
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:15.160]   She doesn't have a label anymore. Ah
[02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:21.640]   Talking about releasing her own album using basically blockchain to have people pay for it
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:25.720]   And I think she one of the things she talked about it has actually already done it
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:30.280]   Imogen heap launched her new song tiny human on blockchain
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:33.400]   When was that?
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.200]   This is pretty recently. I know it's this week. Yeah panel that she was on
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:41.160]   Uh along with rob thomas and zoe Keating
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:43.880]   They talked about this
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:45.880]   And uh, she's already she's already put
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:52.120]   Some songs out potential I think to sort of to allow musicians to sort of customize
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:56.680]   The experience a little bit more. She was talking about how what if she wanted to make it free
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:02.120]   Just for certain like one day or what if she wanted to make it free for specific people
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:07.720]   She totally control it right she would control explain to me how this how does this put a
[02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:10.520]   Layer between you and just the download
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:13.320]   Is it because it's a contract and you?
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:19.720]   So I'm trying to get my head on the details of how it works. I haven't looked at the details, but I assume she's got
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:22.520]   a blockchain
[02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:24.520]   Bitcoin sort of
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:25.960]   intermediary
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:27.960]   and so then you would
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:29.080]   buy
[02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:30.360]   Her album
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:34.920]   Using their wallet or connecting it to your bitcoin wallet. I mean so the
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:38.520]   Bitcoin gridly wouldn't be required here
[02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:42.600]   what blockchain essentially is is a
[02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:44.840]   as a
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:46.840]   Highly distributed database
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:52.600]   That's open to all and an automatic contract structure right it can be used for in fact
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:54.760]   And use that way it could be used for legal contracts
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:21:01.400]   But so if you're selling music what it is is it's essentially you could create a music store using blockchain technology
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:08.280]   That you would control them. You know who can get the music there would be some transaction of some financial transaction
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:12.680]   Bitcoin would be natural but it wouldn't have to be could he be a could be credit card
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:17.960]   But at some point, I suppose theoretically someone could take that once they had paid for it
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:23.320]   And burn it to a CD or but it's a but I would guess at that point it's attached to your
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:25.560]   identifier
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:26.840]   I would assume yeah
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:32.520]   So that's what apple does with itunes when you buy a song on itunes your email your apple account email address is is actually in this
[02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:35.240]   in the data
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:38.280]   They could so they could easily put your bitcoin or your blockchain
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:44.920]   Unique blockchain public address in there. So you'd be you'd be responsible as be watermark. It'd be you'd be responsible for it
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:48.440]   I think the only risk is that it it requires a certain amount of
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:56.680]   Work on the part of somebody who wants to buy it to figure out how to pay for it and what blockchain means and
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:22:01.160]   Right. So it's gonna take nerds basically, but I think it's an interesting
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:05.000]   effort to try and do sort of micro payments at scale
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:12.520]   The negative right now in blockchain at least as implemented with bitcoin is that everybody who's on the blockchain has a full copy of the database
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:15.080]   Right. It's a lot of data
[02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:17.960]   so
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:19.960]   Maybe not the best way to do this
[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:22.280]   I'm not sure
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:27.720]   So this is all done for 24 hours at a guardian live event if you go to the ground you look at a look up image at hip
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:31.400]   He and tiny human blockchain. You'll find the guardian story. Yeah
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:38.680]   Anil dashes have been involved a little bit with this. He wants to use blockchain. How's it for digital signing?
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:41.640]   Yes
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:45.560]   Blockchain has opportunities for passing of data to media companies
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:52.440]   You have a contract relationship that says if I give you this I get that yep and and you can't make multiple copies you can control it
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:55.160]   Right
[02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:58.360]   I don't I don't mind that I like that idea
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:04.200]   You know, let's get something equitable and let's get those guys in white pants smoking cigars in the capital building out of it
[02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.920]   I imagine that they're wearing white pants and sex smoking cigars. They may not be
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:12.840]   Not after may not after may never after may
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:16.920]   Uh, what's your number of the week jeff javis?
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.000]   So my number is one for the first jeff bezos puts up his first tweet
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.400]   One tweet in seven years ladies gentlemen years to celebrate
[02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:30.760]   Uh his use rocket coming back to earth which which I think is just great. Maybe it's a video where I go down on it
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:36.600]   It's it's really quite something but then my favorite thing is marty baron editor washington post to discuss earlier wonderful editor
[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:40.040]   Had to me the best lmf ao tweet. I've seen in weeks
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:45.000]   His tweet simply was at jeff bezos. Welcome to twitter follow me
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:53.960]   Jeff follows no one you think he would follow the washington post and the washington post
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:59.320]   Yeah, he's still not following anybody one tweet. We look at random one tweet no follows ever
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:05.160]   That's funny. Yeah, the jeff jeff's uh jeff of course owns a blue origin
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:07.160]   Which is a civilian private space
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:12.280]   Project which hasn't really done anything. It's been kind of shrouded in mystery
[02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:18.280]   I was interested in everything. Yeah, elon musk was took a sort of yeah. Well. He has space. That's right
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:25.800]   failed shot at jeff and remember that elon musk had a problem as had not yet been able to do what jeff did which is to
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:27.480]   uh
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:31.400]   Land at a launch vehicle so that you could reuse it they've tried
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:34.360]   Yeah, they tried several times, but they haven't been able to do it
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:38.040]   uh, then it's kind of funny to watch this rocket
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:41.080]   attempting to land
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:47.240]   And you know what's unknown is if it could be used again. It did land, but
[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:51.640]   Who knows? Pretty cool. Yeah, but the other thing I can say something a little
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:56.120]   NSFW. Yeah, so if you look at the beginning when the rocket has its its
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:58.600]   module on top
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:00.600]   I couldn't help but it reminded me of the
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:03.720]   movie flesh gordon from years ago
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:06.360]   Uh, you can guess what the rocket looked like
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:11.560]   It looks kind of the same. There was a movie called flesh gordon. Yes. There was
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:17.400]   It was back. Oh god. This is years and years ago. It was classic soft porn. It's a classic
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:24.520]   70s. Well for what it is. Yeah, it does look like a flying uh phallis. Yeah, that's exactly everything cylindrical looks like that
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:26.680]   Well, that's right. That's why
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:28.520]   right
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:33.640]   Yeah, it might be this video is and this and the tweet behind it might be a little self-service
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:36.840]   You know it's one of those things where little we don't know what happened to that thing
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:41.880]   It might even be a little bit in your face elon. I think it is a bit. Don't you think that
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:49.560]   My rocket is bigger than your yeah, it's like i'm sure jondie rocka fella and andrew karnagie kind of had this rifle
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:53.080]   Right, it's like well. I my yacht is bigger than yours
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:57.080]   My rocket's bigger than yours. The weird thing about that video too was in the middle
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:02.520]   It has an animated thing as if passengers are in the capsule and then it goes back to reality if you're not
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:04.920]   Yeah, that's the thing I
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:10.200]   Did I ever tell you that story came from a book about billionaires about larry elison and his boat
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:16.040]   I read that story. Tell us the story. It's very funny. So he had his boat extended
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:21.880]   I guess they just put him they want to have the longest yacht rod on the front right and he wanted it to be bigger
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:28.680]   By even an inch or two than paul allen's boat right and so then after he had this extension added
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:34.600]   He went out in his boat and he saw paul allen's boat and he told his captain to basically cut off
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:40.920]   Paul allen and and let some wake, you know wash the boat and that was his way of saying yeah
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:42.360]   lines bigger
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:45.320]   And I do believe that the other issue was how tall it is because you
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:51.000]   They can't sail sail under the golden gate bridge the golden gate bridge jeff you'll be glad the note does not does not have rays
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.680]   And so you can only have it as tall as it needs to be to get under the golden gate bridge
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:59.960]   And I think they're they're both like within inches an inch yet
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:04.120]   Plus doesn't the wave affect you. Yeah, you have to be very careful
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:10.760]   Well, that's why paul allen's boat has two I think it's got two or three
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:15.240]   Other boats smaller boats inside it because yeah, you can't dock
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:20.280]   Yeah, it can only dock in like two docks in the entire world because it's too big he has a submarine
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:26.360]   In it it's got two helicopter landing pads. Yeah and a submarine. Yeah, and i'm pretty sure he's got three or four
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:29.320]   Navy seals former navy seals who work on the boat
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:32.520]   There's also a release after courting studio waiting
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:40.280]   At any time for paul to come in and lay down some tracks that thing should be in a navy. That's ridiculous vehicle
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:44.680]   And i think someone told me in the super yacht world
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:51.400]   the annual running costs are effectively a tenth of what you paid for it. Oh my god, so
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:57.880]   It's yeah, he probably pays like 30 million dollars a year just to run it. That's a cruise ship
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:00.840]   Yeah
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:06.040]   I just buy the freaking queen mary. Okay, get all over yourself
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:09.400]   I uh
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:12.120]   He of huallen of course owns tech tv briefly
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:15.640]   Oh really? I didn't know that for five of the six years
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:18.280]   and uh
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:22.600]   Our program director was very proud to say he was invited to a party on the boat
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:27.800]   Hey, he had to fly to like monty carlo to go to the party on the boat
