[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.000]   And oh, there's lots to talk about this week.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.960]   I'm back, baby.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.720]   And so is Gina Trapani from smarterwear.org.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.000]   And thinkupapp.com.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.160]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   Good to see you.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.200]   I'm full of ice cream sandwich.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.160]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.120]   Gina was on last night during the announcement from Hong Kong
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.440]   with our all about Android team.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.560]   So I watched.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.720]   We'll have lots to say about that, of course.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.680]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis, the author
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.680]   of a brand new book called Public Parts,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.880]   also what would Google do?
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.240]   And journalism professor at the city university
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.360]   of New York, his blog is Buzzmachined.com.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.720]   By the time-- if you keep writing books like this,
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.480]   Jeff, we're just not going to have any time for a show.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.760]   It's finally got quipped.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.800]   I'm just going to talk.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.960]   We'll just have to do your CV for the first hour.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.920]   Great to see you again.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.720]   I missed you guys.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.080]   Always.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.840]   And back.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.560]   Also joining us, Mr. Peter Rojas from GDGT.com or gadget.com.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.400]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.560]   Who is, of course, like us, watching carefully to see--
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.520]   first of all, let me ask about the Galaxy Next.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.200]   Of course, the announcement was yesterday.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.440]   Two announcements, really.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.720]   The big one was Ice Cream Sandwich.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.040]   It was really Google's announcement.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.880]   But it's going to sit on a Google experience phone
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.440]   from Samsung.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.240]   They're calling the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.080]   But they left out so much.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840]   Like, where can I get it?
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.120]   When can I get it?
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.640]   And how much is it going to cost?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.120]   And so do you know those details, Peter?
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.400]   Well, they haven't announced it.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000]   We do know that Verizon is going to carry it in the US.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.520]   OK.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.320]   That was not a rumor.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.360]   That's true.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.400]   That's true, yes.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.320]   And there are actually going to be two different versions
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.720]   of the phone.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.400]   There's going to be an HSPA+ version and an AT&T version.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.520]   Yeah, though, it might not be--
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.920]   It could be T-Mobile.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.360]   It could be T-Mobile.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.000]   Though they might not have a carrier partner for HSPA+ in the US.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.640]   It could be just--
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.000]   Unlocked, yeah.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.440]   So we'll see.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.160]   Google's certainly done that before, unlocked phones.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.720]   And then they've also had--
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.800]   I mean, with the Nexus S, they originally
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.960]   put it out with a GSM version and then it ended up
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.520]   doing a YMAX version with Sprint a few months later.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.160]   So what they have available next month
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.800]   might not be the only thing they have available early next year.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.000]   Right.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.080]   But Google, we think, will not be selling it.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.480]   I noticed that when I went to google.com/--
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.960]   what was it?
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.000]   Nexus, I think.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.240]   They asked for my name and my email address
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.880]   so that they could let me know.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.400]   So that made me feel like, oh, maybe they'll sell it,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.880]   but they won't will it.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.280]   I think they actually probably will.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.760]   Really?
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.200]   You know, if they have Verizon as a carrier partner,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.160]   they might have an exclusive on it initially.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.560]   So if you want an unlocked version,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.440]   you have to wait until the HSPA+1 comes out.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.280]   Another thing is the LTE version is
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.480]   going to be slightly thicker than the HSPA+ version.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.920]   Is that for antenna reasons?
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.320]   Probably battery life.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   Ah.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.640]   Yeah, that's a big problem with 4G and all the 4G phones
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.800]   battery life just terrible.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.760]   It's getting better though.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.840]   I mean, the first few phones that came out earlier this year
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.240]   was really bad, like the Thunderbolt.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.160]   But I have the Bionic and it's actually--
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.720]   it's better.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.040]   It's not amazing, but it is getting a lot better.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.200]   Well, they're bigger phones.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.000]   The Bionic's huge.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.440]   It's huge.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.040]   And I think they're also just getting better
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.920]   at optimizing the OS.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.520]   Yeah, I noticed that my Galaxy 2S, it turns off 4G pretty
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.120]   regularly.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.520]   I mean, you turn it on and if it's sleeping,
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.200]   if it's not, you're not doing data, it will turn it off.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.640]   It turns it off as much as it can.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.360]   But 3G was the same thing.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.200]   The first 3G phone for battery hogs.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.720]   Right.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.280]   I guess you're right.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.840]   It just takes them a little while to get the hang of it.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.920]   I guess you're right.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.280]   All right, well, we're watching the video right now.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.440]   It's fast.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.720]   It's a dual core.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.280]   We think TIO map, processor running 1.2 gigahertz.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.560]   We believe one--
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.240]   correct me any time I say anything wrong, Peter, or anything
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.840]   else.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.080]   1 giga by the RAM.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.720]   Unclear.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.960]   They've never mentioned SD card in this.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.640]   And that makes me a little nervous.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.320]   Unclear whether there's an SD card on it.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.040]   We'll have a nice curvy, soupy, dupy shape.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.120]   The best thing, the thing that actually sells me more than
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.960]   anything, is 1280 by 800 screen.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.840]   But a big one.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   It's not-- what is it?
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.160]   4 1/2, 4 3/4 inches, right?
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.280]   Huge.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.760]   It's--
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   4.6.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.280]   4.6.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.120]   4.6.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.440]   OK.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   Yeah, it's big.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   It's 5.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   And the funny thing about it is, actually, I think that that
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.760]   is a more comfortable screen size than people realize.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.600]   I mean, the Galaxy S2 came out.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.520]   Some of them came out with a 4.5 inch screen.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.880]   And it works pretty well, I find.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.400]   It really comes down to just the heft of the phone itself,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.200]   really, not as much of the size of the screen.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   Right.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.880]   It's funny.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.320]   I also have the Sprint Galaxy S2.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.680]   And because it's so thin, it's not-- you don't go, oh, this
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.560]   thing is huge.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.400]   You feel like it's kind of light and thin.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.000]   Well, the Dell Watchma call it was 5.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.640]   The Streak is too big.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   I looked at the Streak.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.360]   It looks like one of those--
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.320]   It looks like a Hershey bar they sell at Costco.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.880]   It looks just oversized a little bit.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.520]   Samsung doing a phone called the Note, the Galaxy Note, which
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   has a 5 inch screen.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.320]   And it's a much smaller--
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.240]   it's much smaller than the Dell Streak, the 5 inch Streak.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.720]   So even a 5 inch screen, I think that might be where you
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.760]   break the bank, so to speak.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.160]   But even that, if you can make the casing small enough and make
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.480]   the phone itself thin enough, I think people will use a 4
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.400]   and 1/2 5 inch screen.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.480]   I do have to say that when I--
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.040]   I'm becoming more of an iPhone fan.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.760]   The new 4S has features that make me
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.440]   willing to give up Android.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.080]   The notification system is better.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.880]   Finally, voice dictation everywhere, which I
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.120]   used a lot on Android.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.960]   And actually, it's better.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.120]   I hate to say it.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.040]   It's more accurate than Android.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.760]   The better camera.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.520]   But the screen is so tiny.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.360]   I know it's high res, but it's so tiny.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.840]   That I kind of go back and forth.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.160]   Galaxy S2-- iPhone, Galaxy S2, iPhone.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   And now, my poor old LG G2X, it's just too small.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.400]   I think a 4 inch screen is just too small now.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.320]   I don't want to use it anymore.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.760]   So I guess we are getting used to bigger screens.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.400]   And the nice thing about the Galaxy Nexus
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.880]   is that it has the largest screen and the higher res.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.040]   And high res.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.800]   Now, it's not written a display high res, right?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.440]   What's the dot-preached window?
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.400]   I mean, it's basically this a marketing term, right?
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.680]   It's not like some scientific--
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.840]   No, no, no, no, but it's--
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.240]   I can't remember what the dot pitch is.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.760]   But it is--
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.640]   I think it was like 330 or something like that, pixels
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.840]   per inch.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   So I guess it's close.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.680]   I think somebody put it in the chat room is 319.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.920]   So it is pretty close.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.960]   And I tell you, at that--
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.120]   1280 by-- I mean, listen, 1280 by 720.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.800]   That's a computer monitor.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.040]   That's amazing.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.360]   That's amazing.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.040]   So that's pretty desirable.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.640]   So you notice I'm focusing on hardware,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.680]   because we're going to get to ice cream sandwich in a second.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.840]   But just focusing on the hardware on this Nexus Prime,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.160]   it looks like a pretty good phone.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.360]   Nexus Prime would be a better name, wouldn't it?
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   Yeah, it would be a better name.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.760]   Galaxy Nexus.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.080]   They didn't use the Prime word.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.520]   So hard to say Galaxy first.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.520]   I just want to say Nexus first.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.200]   It really is.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.360]   Having been through the Nexus 1 and the Nexus S is just--
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.680]   Yeah, so it's a weird thing.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   I mean, Samsung is really touchy now.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.120]   This stuff especially given that this phone was in the pipeline
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.360]   before they--
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.800]   Google announced they were buying Motorola.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.120]   So I'm sure--
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.960]   This is probably the last non-moderola Google experience
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.840]   phone you think.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.000]   It's possible.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.040]   We don't know for sure.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.200]   But I think that Samsung wanted to put their imprint on the phone
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.560]   with the name--
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.480]   Next to the galaxies, the Samsung line, and Nexus is the right.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.960]   Exactly.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.040]   They split the difference.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.320]   Right?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.680]   Yeah, they're getting ready to fork.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.720]   They're getting ready to fork.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.000]   But it actually looks a lot like the Galaxy S, too,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.880]   even to the textured back, the camera.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.480]   It's just bigger.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.360]   It's like a bigger one.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.440]   Now these buttons-- OK, now we can talk about ice cream
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.440]   sandwich.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.280]   Let's do that.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.760]   But I wanted to get the hardware out of the way,
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.320]   so we didn't give it short shrift.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.480]   There are lots of great phone hard.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.560]   The new Razer coming out soon, which is pretty sweet.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.640]   I like the Galaxy S2.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.120]   I think the iPhone 4S is a good and interesting thing.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.360]   And of course, there'll be an iPhone 5, probably mid-next year.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.120]   So it's heating up.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.200]   Really heating up.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.360]   I have to say-- and I'll just throw it out there
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.400]   and you guys can shoot me down--
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.200]   little disappointed by ice cream sandwich.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.440]   I don't think it--
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.720]   to me, it didn't feel like a solid response
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.480]   to what Apple's done with iOS phone.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.440]   What was it missing, Leo?
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.120]   Really?
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.840]   I think--
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.760]   Well, OK, a couple of things.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.960]   I think the aesthetics of Honeycomb I've always
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.800]   been disappointed with.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.600]   It's an ugly ass system.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.680]   And it's not just me that feels this way.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.600]   They would be selling more tablets if it looked good.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.520]   Well, Honeycomb--
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.000]   I would agree with you there.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.720]   And I said it was a stopgap.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   It was an emergency--
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.440]   I understand.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.080]   But I don't think ice cream sandwich has fixed enough
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.920]   of those oddball aesthetic things.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.960]   I think there's still a lot of--
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.480]   Fun--
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.200]   --zuy cruft.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.440]   It doesn't feel as refined to me.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.920]   And the fact that they spent-- how long?
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.440]   10 minutes talking about the font?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.640]   Tells me they may be feeling a little self-conscious
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.240]   about design.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.200]   Oh, they definitely are.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.400]   It was a very designed--
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   --centric presentation.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.800]   Which I was telling.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.040]   But I have to say, I agree with you about Honeycomb.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.200]   I don't think Honeycomb is necessarily--
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.520]   I think it's the hologram theme, a holographic theme.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.040]   It looks sort of robotic.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.520]   And I thought the same thing that spending all that time
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.000]   on a tight face and leading off with a tight face
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.640]   seems so strange.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.360]   But then as I looked through the apps
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.520]   and noticed the tight face throughout,
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.440]   I thought, oh, this does feel a lot more human.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   Despite the name, it seems less robotic to me.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.800]   Despite the name of the font.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.360]   Yeah, despite the name of the tight face.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.800]   Oh, this makes a big difference.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.080]   I changed the font.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.560]   I changed the font on my Galaxy S2.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.120]   There's a little app that you can download other fonts.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   And it does make it-- there is something
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.280]   to be said for that.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.200]   It does.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.720]   I hate to say it's Gutenberg time,
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.000]   but the first font was a scribble font.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.120]   And everything we do is all one new casks.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.000]   We keep imitating things that worked in other forms.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.440]   Well, and it is time to--
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.000]   Jobs say that really it all started for him
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.440]   when he took a calligraphy class.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.920]   I mean--
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.320]   Yeah, you did.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.240]   Maybe fonts are that important.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.920]   Well, I think it's actually if you look at one
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.720]   of the reasons why, say, Symbian looked so dated
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.360]   is because they were using a font, that same Nokia Sans
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.040]   font for so long.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.640]   And it gave people sort of a sense
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.320]   that the OS itself was out of date, which it was.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.720]   But it kind of reinforced that sense
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.840]   that it was behind the times.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.760]   And I will defer judgment on the UI
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.440]   and on the fit and finish until I get one of my hands, of course.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.360]   But I was hoping it would be more of a departure from Honeycomb.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.800]   It feels Honeycomy to me.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.320]   Yeah, it does.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.480]   Yeah, what else was missing?
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   Well, I really hope they'd have a response to Siri.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.840]   Maybe this is too soon for them to get that out.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.480]   I think I was-- and I am still a huge fan of Android's
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.280]   voice control.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.400]   I think it's really good.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.920]   I think it does a great job.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.560]   I think it's impressive.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.200]   And then I use Siri.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.480]   And this happens all the time with Apple.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.720]   They take something that's 90% of the way there,
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.120]   and they get that last 10%.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.560]   Yes.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.320]   And it makes a huge difference.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:06.720]   Yes.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.840]   And it's one of the reasons that I'm maybe considering even
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.840]   shifting back to an iPhone is that dictation is so good.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.320]   And Siri is so responsive.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.800]   And I really-- I believe that Google has this technology.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.440]   I believe they could do this, or they're very close to.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.680]   And I've talked to their speech recognition side is--
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.520]   the guy who runs it came from nuance.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.200]   They have the capability.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.640]   And by the way, I notice--
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.480]   tell me if I'm wrong.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   It feels like Google voice transcriptions have gotten
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.320]   better and better and better, right?
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.280]   They used to be just like, what?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.720]   And now they actually are kind of close to the message.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.440]   Yeah, they have gotten better.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.600]   But that was definitely my impression of Siri.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.320]   It was like, oh, this is right.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.160]   That last 10%, just like you said.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.120]   So Google releases stuff early when it's not perfect, right?
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.080]   And Apple goes late, but they bring it to that finish.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.960]   So one of the features about Ice Cream Sandwich
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.040]   that I thought was really cool is face unlock, right?
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.800]   In theory.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.000]   In theory.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.440]   I saw two demos.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.120]   Once it was during the announcement yesterday,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.800]   it didn't work.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.480]   And he cracked some joke about the makeup more.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.560]   And then I saw Andy Rubin pull it out at the Asia D conference
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.240]   and say, oh, check out face unlock.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.560]   And it didn't work the first time he tried it.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.160]   It defaulted to the other lock screens.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.640]   And let me try it again.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.360]   And also kind of watching that circle go around your face.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.800]   Yeah, when you watch the video, you
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.560]   could tell that's going to take three seconds.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.720]   Yeah, I'm not going to wait three seconds to unlock my phone.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.000]   You know, I'm just not going to hold my--
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.360]   My theory on that is they needed to find some safe use
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.560]   for facial recognition to get us used to the concept.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.640]   Ah, that's a good theory.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.840]   Oh, well, interesting.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.800]   That's interesting.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   It's creepy.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.240]   It's creepy line.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.400]   Although we've had facial recognition in desks
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.640]   and laptops for years.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.160]   I mean, literally--
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.040]   Yeah, but who uses it?
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.920]   Nobody, because it doesn't work.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.280]   Oh, that's true too.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.160]   So I mean, I think the pattern is really easy.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.720]   And I'm in, and it's fast.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.600]   And the face recognition, if I have to go, OK, look at me.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.640]   [HONKING]
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.720]   And then maybe it works.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.760]   Maybe it doesn't.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.960]   Even if it works 80% of the time, that means one time and four.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.680]   I have to do it over.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.160]   One time and five.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.480]   Well, isn't it even true?
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.080]   How many FaceTime calls have you made on an Apple phone?
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.640]   A few, non-zero one.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.200]   And I thought it was going to be a big deal.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.640]   You can see the world from both ends and yada, yada, yada.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.880]   And I was wrong.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.320]   And maybe we will come to that.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.760]   But somehow, we're just not using these to picture ourselves.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.720]   No, in fact, you're right.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.680]   There's a FaceTime test that I now apply.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.480]   In fact, when I look at every new Apple feature,
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.560]   I say, is this another FaceTime?
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.760]   Demo's good.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.760]   Sounds cool.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.360]   Ooh-ah.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.680]   No one uses it.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.720]   And then no one uses it.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.360]   And FaceTime Lock could definitely be that, right?
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.560]   Panoramic photos and time-labs video,
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.200]   I thought was really cool.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.840]   And the text response when refusing calls also really cool.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.080]   Those are kind of my three big features.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.640]   So panorama-- I mean, Motorola's
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.200]   been doing this in their phone for a while.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.920]   Of course, there are plenty of panorama apps as well.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.240]   So that's nice.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.200]   You know, I think much more important than that in the camera
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.240]   is how fast it is.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.760]   Yes, great.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.960]   Apple was touting this.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.640]   Apparently, I don't know, maybe Peter, you can explain more.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.560]   Is this hardware is getting faster,
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.360]   or they're really paying attention to these apps?
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.960]   But it's very clear, if you're going to replace--
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.520]   and I think that these phones are--
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.800]   point and shoot cameras, then the time to camera,
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.840]   and the time to picture, and the time between pictures,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.760]   very important, this is even faster than the iPhone 4S,
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.160]   at least based on a video that I saw.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.800]   Yeah, I mean, it's becoming a huge point of differentiation
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.360]   for companies.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.600]   And so, you know, HTC has made a really big emphasis
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.680]   on having a great camera in their latest phones,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.240]   so the HTC Amaze and the HTC Sensation both
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.680]   have really emphasized the quality of the camera,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.440]   and how fast you can take photos with it.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.240]   And, you know, the Amaze, for example,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.880]   has dedicated photo and camcorder buttons, which
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.880]   is pretty interesting.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.320]   And so, you know, it's really, really important.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   I think that, you know, at the high end,
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.480]   having something that offers not just good quality photos,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.560]   so just having a good sensor, you actually
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.640]   have to have something with really fast shutter speed,
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.840]   and reduce that lag, and let people get that shot
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.680]   instantaneously.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.960]   It's one of my complaints actually about Motorola's phones,
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.400]   is that the cameras are--
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.200]   That biotic.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:20.640]   --are really slow.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.840]   I can't believe you stuck with that,
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.200]   because the worst camera I've ever seen.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.120]   Well, I mean, I have like six phones in my desk, Leo.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:26.840]   But do you agree?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.080]   I mean, the biotic is like three seconds to picture.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.120]   Oh, you know what?
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.320]   All of them are like that.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.200]   I don't know what it is about the Motorola,
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.360]   how the software is interacting with the hardware,
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   or whatever, but they're all very slow.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.600]   Well, I think a new standard has been set.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.960]   And based on the video that I saw--
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.280]   and I wish I could remember who so shot it--
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.920]   this Nexus, Galaxy Nexus, could be the fastest of the bunch.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.760]   Now, this is the time lapse feature.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.360]   This is the video they showed.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.040]   This is cool.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.240]   I'm sure they're apps that do this, right?
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.320]   But it's still cool.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.760]   The fact is that people are going
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.320]   to use the features that are built, baked into the phone more,
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.240]   then go find, you know, download the app.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.560]   Well, I think this doesn't pass the FaceTime test,
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.880]   because in order to do time lapse,
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.480]   people are going to realize you need a tripod.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.960]   Who has a phone tripod?
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.680]   This guy was using a very fancy slider mechanism.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.200]   We've used it.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.160]   I know about it.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.800]   It does great.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.920]   But who has this?
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.040]   We need one of those gorilla clip things for phones, right?
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.120]   Some people have it, I guess.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   But isn't it?
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.680]   Sometimes stuff has features just to help sell it,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.160]   even if people--
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.640]   Yes.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:35.540]   Definitely.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.440]   Because it's like FaceTime is a perfect example, right?
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.000]   People are having the iPad having a camera in the first place,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.680]   which everyone was like, oh, I can't wait until the iPad 2
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.560]   has a camera.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.360]   And then two months later, everyone's like, well,
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.680]   I never use the camera in my iPad 2.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.560]   And it's just when it seems like it makes you
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.160]   want to buy something.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   Right.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.680]   Who did that?
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.880]   There's a good view.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.720]   Nobody uses the camera in the iPad 2.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.280]   It is so bad.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.720]   And you produce me a word for them,
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.040]   and it's like, wow, where?
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.840]   Wow, where?
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.720]   I like it.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.200]   Wow, where?
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:02.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.640]   Now there are tumble blogs of pictures of people
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.440]   taking pictures with their tablets,
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.880]   because it looks that awkward.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.640]   Actually, we had a photo walk in Vegas,
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.000]   and somebody did take a picture with this tablet.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.960]   So the panorama is nice software.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.400]   But again, this is not so different from a software
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.840]   that's already available in Android.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.200]   But how about the little stuff?
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.240]   How about the little information?
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.440]   Well, you said the third thing you said, which I really
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.600]   agree is cool, is that respond with a call by swiping it
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.200]   with a message.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.840]   Like, go away from me, you creep.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   Right, I'm driving.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.440]   I'm driving.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.720]   Someone calls you, and you refuse the call.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.640]   Say, hey, I'm on the road.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.760]   Call you later.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.360]   Is that where--
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360]   Is that where I'm?
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   Is that where I'm?
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.040]   I don't think so.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.600]   I think that's-- again, hard to say,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.600]   because I haven't used it yet.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.080]   But that seems like just a good--
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.800]   I think that's something I'm definitely going to use.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.720]   And just the general phone makeover,
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.600]   that phone app makeover where visual voicemail
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   is integrated into your call log.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.440]   And you can see the text.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.080]   I got excited about that when I first saw it.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.960]   And then I thought about workflow.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.920]   You're-- I mean, I'm sure that they
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.880]   have a separate visual voicemail app.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.800]   But how often do you go to a person's contact
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.720]   to listen to the voicemail from that person?
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.000]   Well, so you see when you missed a call from someone, right?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.500]   Right.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.480]   So I'm going to get a notification.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.800]   Miss Call from Leo.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   I often will tap that, and then I wind up in my call log.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.840]   And then from there, I can hit play.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.080]   But although I don't know, I'm not sure if this is how it works.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.440]   I haven't used the yet.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.360]   But--
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.880]   When I first saw that, I thought, oh, that's really cool.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.920]   Now, this is also very cool.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.480]   This is the-- can't talk right now.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.600]   Go away.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.040]   But this data usage, they spent a long time on the graph.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.760]   That also has been available in some version, some flavors
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.040]   of Android already.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.000]   Nerd bait.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.520]   Nerd bait.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.120]   Yeah, graphs.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.120]   You guys said that last night.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.960]   Love graphs.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.000]   Love graphs.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.080]   They have a very Windows Phone 7-ish people hub
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.240]   that I thought was kind of interesting.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.040]   Oh, wait.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.560]   Everyone wants to look at pictures of their friends, right?
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.200]   By the way, they're saying the Galaxy S2, Settings, Call.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.560]   What was it?
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.200]   Settings has-- has--
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   ignore messages.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.760]   Yeah, you have that already on your phone.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.920]   You should.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.360]   Is that a touch whiz?
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.120]   It seems to me that it's a Samsung.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.600]   It's a Samsung thing.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.480]   You know, I even wonder about the norm of that.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.160]   I've been lamenting recently that I really
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.640]   want to bring back the busy signal.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.600]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.200]   Exactly.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.800]   And just say, I'm not available right now.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.040]   You can be that lovely now.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.320]   A busy signal with Google Voice.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.680]   You can sort of say I'm not--
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.960]   Yeah, Google Voice calls right now.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.880]   Yeah, I use that all the time.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.800]   It's kind of sad.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.000]   And so the norm is--
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.120]   it's-- you know, Leo, I think you and I are the same way
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.960]   as I'm rude.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.560]   And sometimes some people have to cry me three times on email
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.960]   before I say, OK, OK, I'll deal with it now.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.480]   And so now this is another expectation
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.240]   that we're going to have to-- well, you didn't pick up
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.160]   my call and you didn't swipe either.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.840]   I think Android 5 now with busy signal.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.720]   I love it.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.800]   And a long curly wire.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.720]   You know, my wife wants a curly wire
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.320]   because she says the cordless phone keeps getting lost.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.080]   She says, just give me a phone on the wall in the kitchen
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.120]   with a long curly wire.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.480]   Then I'll know where the phone is.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.280]   She's got a point.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.560]   Bring back long curly wires.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.680]   All right, so what else?
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   We've got Roboto.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.640]   Oh, at Near Field Communications, AKA Beam.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.920]   That is a FaceTime.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.080]   That's the horizontal turn.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.600]   Android Beam with the Alex-E Nexus.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.120]   If you know somebody else with the Galaxy Nexus,
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.080]   you can put your phones back to back, the beast with two
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.640]   backs, and transfer what you're doing.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.680]   That's never going to happen.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.680]   I don't let my phone touch anybody else.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.560]   It demoed nicely.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.720]   But that is the definition of while we're--
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.920]   And yeah.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.120]   I do like the idea.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.280]   And I think that I use bump occasionally, which
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.200]   is where you bump the phones together.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.160]   And it's Android as well as iPhone.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.560]   But it's occasionally way out.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.800]   For like once.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.320]   So--
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   No, actually, I have used--
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.000]   I'm like once to try it.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.840]   No, I have used it.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.680]   When you-- no, OK.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.400]   Here's a really good use for this.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.080]   Somebody's got some--
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.920]   it takes a great picture, and you want it.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.640]   Bump is great.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.320]   You could load the picture in your bump
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.400]   if you've got bump on your phone, and you bump it.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   I used it at a food camp to give somebody an application.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.960]   So they're occasionally where you want to get something off
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.280]   of your phone and get it on their phone.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.960]   That's not a bad way to do it.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.000]   I used it once at food camp.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.240]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.240]   Well, all right.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.040]   You're right.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   And this is the problem.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.960]   Yeah, all right.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.320]   There you go.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:41.880]   You know, it's funny.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.640]   It's one time at food camp.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.120]   I used bump.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.720]   I used bump.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.640]   It was awesome.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.840]   It was one time.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.920]   If the world was food camp, we'd all be bumping.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.840]   That's the problem.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.760]   There are not enough geeks in the world.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   Go ahead, Joshua.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.000]   I'm Peter.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.480]   This is going to say, you remember WebOS had this,
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.920]   where you were able to tap to share between a touchpad
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.720]   and a palm tree.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.600]   And that was sort of touted as a really big feature.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   I remember a convex.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.040]   This is how long ago this is, where IBM had things
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.720]   that they put in their shoes.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.400]   And when you shake hands, the connection would be made.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.680]   And from your shoe to the other guy's shoe,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.360]   your contact information would go.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.600]   So you'd shake hands and collect--
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.760]   It smells along the way.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.720]   So this is something that business people, I think, want.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.760]   It's a way to exchange information friction.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.200]   All right, does this mean that they run out
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.840]   of possible features for phones?
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.200]   Yes.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.520]   That they're just trying to make up crap?
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.800]   It's their makeup, actually.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.160]   I think, though, that there are some seminal features.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.280]   I think Siri is a breakthrough.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.560]   And I think the response to Siri is what we have to watch
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.000]   Google with carefully.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.920]   Mike Elgin said something very interesting, though,
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.800]   when he saw Siri, he said, "Apple, as always, pioneered it.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.560]   But watch out, because Google is in a better position
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.200]   to capitalize on it because they know so much more about you."
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.560]   They have more-- more about you
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.920]   and they have more voice samples.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   Oh, and that's true, too.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.760]   They could, in theory, do a better job.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.360]   So I don't think that that race is over,
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.720]   but I think the race has begun.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.760]   And I'm very interested to see Google get into this race.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.200]   They say voice typing, "Watch text instantly
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.560]   appear as you speak with voice input."
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   I don't know what I-- I don't know if that's good or not.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.960]   I don't know what that is.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.400]   Both existing Android voice commands and Siri
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.080]   and the dictation built into iPhone wait till you're done.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.200]   Then they send it to the server and they get it back.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.360]   This is like right away.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.280]   They're trying to make it more real time.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.400]   Potentially good if it's as accurate.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:52.900]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.680]   It was funny, there was a mistake when
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.600]   they were demoing it a lot.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.160]   Oh, there was?
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.600]   Oh, there you go.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.080]   It's noisy.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.640]   It's not perfect.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.320]   I mean, I think the real breakthrough with Siri
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.400]   is that it tries to use more natural language for this stuff
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.040]   that you don't have to think about commands.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.920]   And also the fact that it's just baked more deeply into the OS
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.480]   so that it hooks into more of Apple services and apps
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.160]   and stuff like that.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.600]   And I think that Google or whomever--
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.120]   I mean, obviously Microsoft has done a lot of voice stuff
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.280]   with Windows Phone as well.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.760]   That's right.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.640]   These guys can catch up.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.880]   It's more about how are you thinking about the product
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.320]   and how it integrates with the rest of the OS.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.200]   And not just about voice commands or about transcription,
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.880]   but really about that natural language,
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.760]   trying to understand what it is you're saying.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.080]   And I think that's really the thing that Apple has done really
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.440]   well.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.400]   Yeah, there's the error right at the front, the first word map.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.840]   He said, hey, man, I came out map.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.920]   And then it says Yahoo at the bottom.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.840]   Yeah, what's that?
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.000]   He went like, yeah, or yeah.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   Oh, man.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:58.960]   Oh, man.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.840]   They had several demo fails.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.640]   It was really funny because he had some like,
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.480]   and it kicked up his Yahoo.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.000]   Yahoo.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Yahoo.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.720]   You know, it's my favorite thing in the world
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.840]   not to correct typing and dictation errors and just send it.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.240]   And let the chips fall where they may.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.760]   You can incomprehensible message for me, guys.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.080]   You'll know why.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.600]   Go ahead.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.480]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.880]   No, no, sorry.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.760]   So question I ask you every five devices that come out.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.120]   Developer check here.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.720]   4.0 came out, right?
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   SDK is out already.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.560]   Yeah, the SDK is out.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.600]   Have you looked at it?
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:38.960]   I did.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.000]   I downloaded it this morning.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.880]   I wanted to see what my app would look like.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.840]   And I mean, you know, the great thing about Android
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.400]   is that there's always talk about how many true tablet apps
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.360]   does Android have versus for the iPad.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.880]   But the reality is that the way the Android SDK is designed,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.560]   you design for every different screen size.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.280]   So apps are built relative, right?
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.600]   So apps just fill.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.880]   So my app completely works.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.720]   It doesn't take advantage of the things
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.520]   that HoneyCon and Ice Cream Sandwich offer,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.200]   like the action bar and fragments and things like that.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.360]   But it completely works, which is nice.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.040]   As a developer, I'm much more motivated to start optimizing
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.400]   for the big screen--
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.000]   the Ice Cream Sandwich, Honeycomb, Action Bar, and fragments.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.360]   I got much more motivated to build that stuff into my app,
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.720]   which my app has kind of the old school, you know,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.440]   the action bar that you have to do kind of by hand.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.200]   But now that's all built into the SDK.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.040]   So I'm definitely going to be upgrading my app.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.160]   Also widgets you can resize now and they scroll,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   which is really nice because before, you know,
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.120]   as a developer, you have to be like,
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.880]   well, let me make the small version of my widget
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.840]   and the big version of my widget and let the user decide.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.520]   So that's super nice.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.840]   But yeah, I'm excited.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.560]   I'm excited about diving in.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.200]   Much more excited about diving into ICS development
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.520]   than I was Honeycomb development.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   Cool.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.560]   That's good.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.480]   What are fragments?
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.120]   Fragments, it's kind of relative rendering
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.200]   of your app's screen.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.480]   So if you have a big screen, you can do, say,
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.320]   like a split view, you know, like a left side
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.040]   with a list of items, then you tap on it
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.120]   and you can see, you know, details on the right side.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.880]   Like if you think about Gmail, you have your list of messages
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.000]   and you can tap it a message and see the conversation
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.720]   on the other side.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.760]   If you flip the tablet portrait or if you're on a small screen,
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.040]   you only see one fragment.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   Whereas if you have a big screen,
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.400]   then you can see two fragments.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.200]   So that helps you to build screens that are screen size
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.200]   variable.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:30.920]   Exactly.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.840]   Exactly.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.720]   You can build those for lower versions of Android,
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.120]   but you have to do it by hand.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.720]   And the way that fragments work is that they can talk
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.240]   to one another.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   One fragment knows if you've tapped on something
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.800]   and the other.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.040]   And they resize to different screens gracefully.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.000]   And you can share code more easily.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.440]   It's just much easier and nicer for developers.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.760]   That is neat.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.960]   So it's essentially a view region.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.000]   It's a view.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.200]   And they have multiple views on the screen.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.760]   But they are objects that can communicate.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.320]   They can say messages.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.920]   They communicate to one another, exactly.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.200]   They can send messages to one another.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.280]   They're aware of each other state.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.080]   They can render depending on, you know,
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.840]   what's going on in the others.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.120]   And the action bar is pretty cool, too.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.600]   Like if you saw in the Gmail demo,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.760]   if you select multiple messages in the action bar,
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.840]   which is the area across the top of the screen,
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.800]   it would say like three messages, four messages, five messages
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.720]   selected.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.640]   And then the buttons would change based on, you know,
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.160]   what you could do with those messages.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.320]   Like, I want to delete all these.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.680]   I want to archive all these.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.440]   So it's like the action bars kind of like can also
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.960]   be aware of what's happening in different views and change
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.920]   and become more contextually relevant.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.120]   That's cool.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.160]   Yeah, which is really--
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.960]   I mean, it's really nice.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.360]   When you use Gmail and Calendar and Maps,
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.920]   and I guess music and G+ are going to be updated for this,
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.520]   too, you really-- on a Honeycomb tablet,
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.720]   I have the Galaxy tab.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.280]   You really do see-- it's very nice.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.040]   But apps have to be written to take advantage of those
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.400]   capabilities in the SDK.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.480]   And it's not going to be up to Google
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.760]   to set the standard with their reference apps, basically.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.960]   Exactly.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.840]   Exactly.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.360]   Andy Rubin says it's filled with butter.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.760]   We want everything to be as smooth as butter.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.360]   He said the software includes all kinds of other features.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.680]   I guess there's so much in there we didn't see it all.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.880]   From being able to control music from the lock screen,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   like that, to allowing developers to tap the phone's
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.440]   graphics processor for image intensive tasks.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.000]   You know what I like?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.680]   Actually, Google's looking at the third party apps
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.440]   and taking the best of each and incorporating it.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.360]   One of the responses I have is, well, I could do that.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:27.920]   I could do that.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.360]   I could do that.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.800]   But putting it in the OS, it makes it much better.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.920]   And there's underlying stuff like fragments and action
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.160]   bars, which give it whole new capabilities.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.680]   That's exciting.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.640]   All right, maybe-- OK, I'm feeling better about it.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.440]   We've kind of convinced you.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.560]   I was going to get one anyway.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.080]   I was really tempted by the 4S as well, the iPhone 4S.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.160]   And I was wondering how I was going to break it to the tweak
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.720]   audience that when my contract is up in January,
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.320]   I might get an iPhone 4S.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.680]   Your timing's excellent.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.800]   By January, it'll be a little more clear, I think.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.400]   Yeah, it will be more clear.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.760]   I mean, the iPhone thing for me is,
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.840]   it's the last jobs phone.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.160]   And I'm also just doing some iOS development.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.360]   And I realized that I had a developer send me a pull request
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.200]   on my iOS app.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.000]   And it was like, pull down to search.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.880]   And I was like, that's what you do in iOS to search.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.240]   I was realized that I was completely
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.200]   unaware of the iOS conventions.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.080]   So part of it is just like, I feel like out of touch.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.040]   But ice cream sandwich kind of swayed my decision.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:25.920]   So I don't know.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.040]   I think by January, you're right.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.080]   It will be more obvious.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   Scope will, of course, said that immediately afterwards,
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.440]   this is the thing that may have him drop the iPhone.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.240]   Well, as you know, I dropped the iPhone
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.360]   for Android a long time ago because I liked the openness.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.000]   I liked-- there were things that, like the notifications,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.520]   were just light years ahead.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.680]   But Apple's caught up.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.840]   And in fact, in some ways, Apple's notification system
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.200]   is, I think, better.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.880]   Really?
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.360]   Their dictation is better now.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.800]   That was another area.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.240]   I do miss the ability to put desktop, live desktops, widgets
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.680]   on the screen to be able to customize the desktop.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.040]   I miss that.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.800]   But of course, that is an area where you could really--
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.080]   people can really mess their phone up good.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.160]   So maybe that's why Apple doesn't allow you to do it.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:17.040]   Peter, you use all kinds of phones.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.160]   So you don't have an allegiance to anyone.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.120]   I tend to use an Android phone as my primary phone.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.840]   Actually, I wrote something on gadget last week
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.360]   about why I wasn't buying an iPhone 4S.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.240]   Oh, I do remember that.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   Oh.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.520]   And I listed a bunch of reasons.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.760]   This was pre ice cream sandwich.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.480]   So I wasn't taking into account what would be in 4.0.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.800]   I was talking about why I use Android now.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.240]   And I talk about Gmail.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.480]   And if you use Gmail, you're not going
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.880]   to get a better Gmail experience.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.200]   No, that's true.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.480]   Little things like I like to use Swift key for my keyboard.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.120]   And I just cannot get into the keyboard on iPhone.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.960]   That was actually the biggest sticking point for me.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.720]   I hate it that you can't change it.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.280]   That's a terrible keyboard.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.680]   For crying out loud, it's always
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.320]   in caps.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.440]   Apple, everybody in the world knows
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.760]   that you leave it in lowercase.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.880]   And then when you press the shift,
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.600]   it goes into caps as a way of telling the user,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.040]   you're in caps now.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.640]   It's just little things like that.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.040]   I thought Apple cared about stuff like that.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.240]   And there are lots of little things like that.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.000]   And again, we talked about screen size earlier.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.160]   But 3.5 inch-- I actually think that the market has kind
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.080]   of spoken in terms of--
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.760]   I agree.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.280]   --of large--
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.720]   I think there are very few people.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.400]   I think that people go-- the iPhone is a great device.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.600]   And I understand why people buy it and a lot of reasons
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.720]   to use it.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.880]   But I think that consumers have shown a general preference
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.480]   more around four inch screens in terms of what they're buying.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.360]   When they have a choice to buy Android phones,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.080]   they can buy 3.5 inch Android phones and 3.7 inch Android
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.240]   phones.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.520]   But they're tending to buy four and 4.3 inch Android phones.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.120]   You ask a great question, which we're
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.640]   going to get to in just a moment about the razer, which
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.760]   some people are saying will be the Verizon phone to get,
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.840]   at least until the Nexus Galaxy Nexus comes out.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.280]   I was at that event yesterday.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.040]   Yeah, let's talk about that in just a second.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   There were other events out there.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.400]   But we're going to take a break.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.160]   It's great to have you.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.560]   Peter Rojas from gadget.com, GDGT.com.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.560]   Jeff Jarvis, of course, and Gina Trapani
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.960]   are regulars on the show.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.440]   I'm frozen.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.840]   But you're frozen in a kind of--
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.120]   I didn't even fix that during the show.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.720]   Yes, because of the word.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.400]   I know.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.320]   It's a little sad that you--
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.840]   I don't like that.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.800]   Yes, I like that.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.480]   We want to give Gina a hug right now.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.440]   So melancholy.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:46.080]   It's cow eyes.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   OK, OK.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.160]   All right, all right, all right.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.520]   That's a meme waiting to happen.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.800]   The cow eyed meme.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.240]   You might want to talk to you about Goda Meeting.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.640]   GodaMated.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.600]   So excited from Citrix, the folks who do, of course,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.880]   all that remote access stuff.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.840]   And Goda Meeting takes remote access
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.520]   and adds it to your Android phone and your iPhone,
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   as well as your iPad.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.240]   And of course, your desktop computer.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.760]   So now, yes, on your Android phone,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.680]   you could take a meeting with Go to Meeting.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.280]   And of course, that HD faces.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.080]   If you've got your laptop there, you can see the video.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.520]   I mean, just there's so many nice, so many nice things
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.880]   about Go to Meeting from Citrix.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.240]   I want you to try it.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.000]   And I really want you to try the Android app.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.960]   So here's the deal.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.280]   First, go to the website.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.080]   Go to Meeting.com.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.720]   Just click the try it free button off or code twig.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.640]   And put-- actually, I guess this is
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.160]   if you want to hold a meeting.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.800]   Put that on your desktop or your laptop
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.440]   that you'll hold the meeting from.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.800]   Do it with on one with a camera, too,
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.920]   so you can see the HD faces, because this is really cool
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.240]   to see people's faces.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.160]   But then, also, once you've got the account,
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.280]   set it up on your Android mobile device.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.920]   And don't forget to tell the people who attend your meetings
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.560]   that they can use an Android, an iPhone, or an iPad,
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.760]   as well as their laptops or desktops.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.160]   It's so cool to be on a phone and see the desktop sharing,
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.680]   see the video.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.160]   It is really awesome.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.560]   At 10 meetings on the go at the airport,
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.680]   at a taxi cab, wherever you are.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   And it's free right now.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.840]   For the first 30 days, go to Meeting.com.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.760]   Visit, I should say.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.920]   Don't say go to, because then people type go to go to Meeting.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.560]   Visit go to Meeting.com.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.960]   And use the offer code twig, T-W-I-G,
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.440]   to get your 30 days free.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.600]   You don't have to have it installed ahead of time to attend
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.120]   a meeting.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.880]   It's really cool.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.440]   Really cool.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.000]   Give it a try.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.040]   Go to Meeting.com and use the offer code twig.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.640]   So is Motorola is not yet a part of Google, Peter?
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.280]   No, I mean, this is a transaction
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.080]   that is going to take a long time to close.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.960]   And they have to get regulatory approval and all that stuff.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.240]   Yeah, Eric Schmidt was there, right?
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.480]   It was weird because he was there,
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.640]   but he didn't get up and speak.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.280]   He's actually-- I mean, he has spoken at other phone
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.120]   launches before and gotten up.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.240]   But he was there.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.120]   I was about 15 feet away from him.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.680]   Sitting there in the front row with a gigantic security
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.480]   guard sitting right behind him.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.800]   And security style.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.120]   He's beefy guy with the Bluetooth headset.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.880]   And I kept waiting for the moment where they were going to be
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.000]   like, and now we have Eric Schmidt to come up and talk about--
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.240]   what's-- talk about ice cream sandwich or something
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:34.760]   like that.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.400]   And he never got up.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.000]   And then as soon as they finished the announcements,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.600]   he bolted.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.800]   He was gone.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.160]   And it wasn't entirely clear why he was there.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.280]   In fact, they actually didn't talk about Google very much
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.040]   at the Motorola event.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.000]   And the razor doesn't have ice cream sandwich
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.080]   when it launches.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.760]   We'll get it sometime early next year.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.200]   But it was just really-- it was just this weird--
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.000]   we kept waiting for them to talk about Google.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.600]   But they didn't at all.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.280]   Why-- they could have at least done an Ed Sullivan.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.960]   And in our audience tonight, we've
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.880]   got Eric Schmidt.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.080]   Eric's turn up and take a bow or something.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.200]   Acknowledge.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.440]   Well, I kept thinking like, is it really him?
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.120]   And then I saw the security guard.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.720]   So that actually raises a good question.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:25.360]   How long before we start seeing ICS on Android phones?
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.400]   Are they going to do upgrades?
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.960]   Are they going to-- is the Galaxy 2S going to be upgraded?
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.320]   So supposedly, every phone that runs Gingerbread now
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.960]   can be upgraded is upgradable.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.000]   But it's always the same thing.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.240]   It's whether the carriers and the manufacturers
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.760]   get it together.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.440]   Google's been really pushing for manufacturers
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.720]   to commit to at least 18 months of upgrades.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.320]   That's what they said at I/O, right?
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.640]   And so I think we'll probably start
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.080]   to see the first upgrades for Q1 of next year.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.760]   It's kind of like which Gingerbread it took three to six
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   months, but most phones-- not most phones,
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:05.560]   but most of the phones that people bought earlier this year
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.280]   or even later last year have tended to get those upgrades.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.520]   It's interesting now how there's a certain commonality.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.960]   All these phones have a certain thing.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.720]   They're very thin.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.040]   They've got big screens.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.200]   This one's got a nice feature.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.320]   It's Kevlar in the back and Gorilla Gorilla Glass
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.800]   in the front, so you could use it for body armor.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.320]   It's not a bullet.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.120]   I could use that.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.760]   So I played with it.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.880]   I mean, the Kevlar, the texture on the back
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.680]   feels pretty good.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   You know, I still think that I'm not
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.000]   a huge fan of Motorola's industrial design language.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.480]   No, me neither.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.440]   It just feels like things could have
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.000]   been a little more holistic or seamless, I guess,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.920]   in terms of how they were thinking about things.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.520]   But it's super thin.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.480]   It's kind of impressive how thin it is.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.560]   And the other thing that really impressed me about it
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.120]   was-- or surprised me about it, that didn't impress me about it
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.520]   was that there isn't a removable battery, which
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.480]   is somewhat uncommon with Android phones.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:07.560]   You tend to see most have replaceable removable batteries.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.880]   But with this, it's not an option.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.320]   Well, that raises a question.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.920]   Is the prime-- I'm sorry.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.560]   Does the galaxy nexus have a removable battery?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.800]   Yeah, you can remove the case on the back.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.080]   Yeah, that's kind of a requirement with Android.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.600]   I feel like this is the anti-Android.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.640]   I love you Android.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.560]   It's just that my life has been so much better
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   since I got an extra battery, which says a lot.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   You can be negative.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.360]   You can be positive.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.920]   This is not the fanboy show.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.840]   This is where we honestly talk about our awards at all.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.880]   There are no flawless products in the world.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.400]   And we can say negative things about anything.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:41.960]   Well, that's true.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.640]   That's true.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.080]   I feel pretty strongly about wanting a removable battery.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.120]   I agree.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.080]   In my phone.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.200]   And I'll tell you right now, the first thing I ordered
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.560]   with my iPhone-- by the way, iOS 5 has much worse battery life.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.200]   Really?
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.440]   Is a big old Mophie case.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.000]   A Mofo case that has--
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.360]   Because my 4 has actually been OK.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.040]   4 is pretty good.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.480]   The 4 was the best of the bunch.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.880]   It bested any Android phone, I think.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.600]   But not with iOS 5.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.800]   And I'll be curious if you put iOS 5 on it.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.360]   If you notice, deteriorated battery life
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.760]   or if it's the 4s.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.120]   I suspect it's iOS 5.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:16.600]   Right, Peter?
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.000]   People are saying--
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.440]   Yeah, Ryan Block was complaining about this,
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.080]   where he put iOS 5 on his iPad, and I think on his iPhone.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   And Justin standby mode, the battery was dying.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.680]   I have an iPad 2, and I haven't noticed that problem
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.880]   with the battery life.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.320]   And it sounds like it's maybe 5% or 10% of people.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.120]   There's a theory that it's the my friends thing.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.160]   That it's just always looking for friends.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.360]   Ah, find my friends.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:43.840]   Find my friends.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.200]   Always looking.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   And there are Android apps that will do that.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.040]   It'll just kill you, bail, life like that.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.360]   If you turn on the GPS feature on Evernote, for instance--
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.240]   and by the way, it's not just find my friends.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.640]   But the reminder also is watching where you are.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.200]   Because reminders, if you could set a reminder on the iPhone
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.880]   that says, if I'm at the grocery store,
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.360]   let me know to buy milk.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.440]   And that's a cool feature.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.640]   Of course, those things are--
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.720]   the GPS on Evernote, it's constantly
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   looking where you are that's going to deplete the battery life.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.040]   So maybe that's all it is.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.360]   If you turn off those features, we'll have to test.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:17.840]   It's possible.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.520]   And in my experience, it always takes an update
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.800]   to fully optimize.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.360]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.160]   Apple, Android, whoever, usually the first out the gate
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.360]   version, the release version, it still
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.120]   needs some optimization in terms of battery life.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.200]   But I'm with you, Gina.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   The first thing I buy is I buy another battery.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.160]   And then what I'd like to buy is a USB charger
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.400]   so I can keep that battery charging.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:41.920]   Yes.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:42.440]   Besides the phone.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.000]   Because otherwise, you have to kind of wake up
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.840]   in the middle of the night and put a new battery in.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.320]   Right.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.600]   Which I've also done.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.560]   I admit.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.360]   You need to sleep better.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.040]   It's 2 AM.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.520]   I better change the battery.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.120]   Better change the battery.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.720]   Well, see, OK, so I had children.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.400]   You had to change their diapers.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.800]   Now I get up in the middle of the night
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:06.080]   and I change my rearranged plugs and get all my things.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.920]   Chargers, even though.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.440]   Heat up some more milk for your Android tablet.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.680]   Oh, you go to heaven and you go to the end.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.280]   And so that's what I do in the middle of the night.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.880]   Just the old habits die hard, I guess.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.960]   My mom just started carrying a cell phone
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   like pretty regularly.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.240]   She's been kind of slow to adopt technology,
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.520]   but has figured out that I'm more likely to text her than call
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.360]   her.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.560]   But we had this funny conversation
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.920]   where she was like, the battery keeps running out.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.240]   And so well, how often do you plug it in?
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.680]   She's like, I want maybe one so eager.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.360]   I mean, I got to do this every night.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.480]   And I was like, mom, yeah, you're
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.560]   going to have to do it every night.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.200]   She's like, this is just a thing that you do.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.320]   My god.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.560]   She was like a ball.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.920]   You know, what was involved in using a cell phone.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.480]   By the way, I love that picture of you
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.240]   and your mom and your wife on the beach.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.320]   I saw that on Facebook.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.240]   Very cute.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.760]   Very cute.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.640]   No, I think you're right.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.960]   Normal people are shocked, shocked
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.560]   that you have to plug it in every night.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.360]   I hear that all the time.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:03.880]   Is this a life?
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.560]   This is what you do?
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.360]   Yes.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:12.720]   I have a beautiful gadget charging station in my home.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.560]   So I have one on my desk.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.160]   Right.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.200]   So you get in, you're emptying your pockets.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.120]   All of the gadgets, you plug them all in.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.520]   And that's why in the middle of the night, I get up and I--
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   So you--
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.720]   A wireless power is going to be so awesome, right?
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.480]   When is that happening?
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.760]   Well, you can get actually phones
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.920]   with the wireless-- the inductive charging backs now.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.840]   Yeah, but you have to put those big ass backs on them.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   Yeah, that's all good.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.800]   Yeah, but they'll get smaller over time.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.880]   And it's just-- you know, we're the very, very early days of it.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.800]   I agree with your inductors.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.640]   That was the thing about the pre that I liked so much.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.760]   Yeah, and that was a good thing about the pre, right?
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.920]   So it can be done.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.800]   It'll get there.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.720]   I think Verizon is actually mandating it as an option
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.080]   for a lot of the-- obviously not for Apple, but--
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.600]   Right.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.720]   We've built a charging shelf into our--
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.120]   When we did our mud room, as soon as we get in the garage,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.640]   there's a closet there on this shelf.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.600]   Nothing but plugs across.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.320]   Brilliant.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.360]   Brilliant.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.200]   That's handy.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.600]   I like that.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.400]   And I do like--
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.240]   I forgot all kinds of mileage out of charging station hacks.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.280]   I find your clips, you know, like to the side of my desk
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.960]   that the wire doesn't fall off, you know?
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.760]   I like that.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.720]   I like that.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.400]   On the cheap.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.560]   I'm glad that everything's moving to these micro USB,
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.480]   because at least you don't have to have different chargers
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.400]   anymore, you know?
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.840]   So I have in my desk in the other office,
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   I have six micro USB things, and I just plug in stuff
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.240]   as I get there.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.320]   OK.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.560]   Have we covered everything you want
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.200]   to say about ice cream sandwich?
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.880]   I think ultimately the thing that I want the most
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:51.640]   from ice cream sandwich is just a really stable OS
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.360]   that never crashes, that never stutters.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.080]   I want the keyboard to know, you know, to not screw up.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.960]   I don't want to have to hit the backspace key very much.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.640]   I just want it to work really, really well.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.520]   I never want to have to think about lag
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.000]   or get that the force close pop up.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.240]   So that's that I think is really what everyone wants,
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.680]   not these wow features.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.000]   So fingers crossed that ice cream sandwich gets
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.960]   closer to that.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.320]   I completely agree with you.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.720]   Although I have to say that sometimes it's the hardware,
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.600]   this LG, GXG2X, random reboots, I went to the galaxy
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.800]   S2, that's been really stable.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.240]   So--
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.160]   Yeah, I mean, that's why I stick with the Nexus line,
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.440]   because it's like, Google worked with these people.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.040]   This is how it's supposed to be.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.960]   This is their vision of how it's supposed to be.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.440]   So that's why I am tempted.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.240]   I am tempted by the galaxy Nexus, even
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.320]   I have to force myself to get the name, right?
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.800]   But you're right.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.720]   Sometimes it is hardware.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.240]   It's true.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.600]   But these Nexus phones are supposed
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.960]   to set the bar of what the experience is supposed to be.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.920]   Although I agree with Peter.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.960]   Peter makes a great point, is that he first
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.520]   release, it's going to be a little--
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.520]   you really do want to wait to the first update.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.440]   So I'm hoping around January, when my account contract is up,
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.560]   things will be stable.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.200]   And stables are going to be with ICS.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.040]   So if you're going to cross it, it's really tough.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.480]   Maybe you should consider a Windows phone,
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.960]   because Steve Ballmer says, you don't have to be--
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.040]   oh, you are a computer scientist, never mind.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.920]   You don't have to be a computer scientist,
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.160]   says Mr. Ballmer to use a Windows phone.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.800]   But you do to use an Android phone.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.440]   So that's why Gina likes it so much.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.800]   Are you a computer scientist?
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.560]   No, Jeff's.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.720]   Which one of us are you pointing at?
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.440]   Neither one of you.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.000]   Neither one of you is.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.600]   I have a master's in English.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.760]   And master's in English.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.200]   Yeah, no, Ballmer's is true.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.560]   I'm totally unqualified to talk about technology.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.320]   But you can write really well.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.920]   He says, I just can't get excited about Android phones.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   You know, it would be weird if he said the opposite,
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.440]   though, right?
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:45.920]   That's true.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.960]   You know, I'm super excited.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.320]   I just--
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:47.520]   That's true.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.800]   --you won't use them.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.400]   And of course, his track record with picking phones
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.920]   has been horrible.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.040]   You know, he said the iPhone's going to be a flop.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.840]   It's too expensive.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.160]   Nobody will ever want it.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.320]   Not the guy to listen to.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.560]   You know, I am withholding judgment
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.680]   until I see the new Nokia, the C-Ray with the mango on there.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.400]   That might be a good phone.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.520]   I'm starting to think that the big three
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.840]   are going to be the iPhone 4S, the Galaxy Prime,
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.800]   and a mango C-Ray phone.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   Nexus.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   Do you--
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.080]   What did I say?
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.280]   The Galaxy Prime?
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.360]   The Galaxy Prime.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.440]   The C-Ray Prime.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.320]   C-Ray Prime.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.280]   Have you seen a C-Ray?
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.240]   Do you know anything about the C-Ray at any time?
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.120]   I think it looks a lot like the N9.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.560]   It's the N9, yeah.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.360]   Yeah, it's similar.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.680]   I mean, from what I've heard from both Microsoft and Nokia,
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.440]   that this is really just going to be like the first thing.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.120]   It's not-- you know, we'll see the really great Windows
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.760]   phones from Nokia next year.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.440]   Oh, too late.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.120]   No, I know.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.720]   But I mean, we'll have decided by then, Nokia.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.720]   Might want to hurry that up a little bit.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.520]   Could be worse.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.240]   You could be a rem.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.680]   Oh, my god.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   That was terrible.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.200]   So last week rims out for what, three days, globally.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.320]   Or as one gadget blog put it, on all the planets.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.960]   And so their response this week is, well,
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.840]   we're going to give you $100 worth of software.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.360]   And if your corporation will give you some free tech support,
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.440]   it is just getting worse and worse.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.360]   I'm starting to feel bad for them.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:30.560]   I listen to Radio Canada on CBC on Sirius all the time.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.840]   Because they have good programs.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.600]   And they're covering rims like it's really a story,
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.520]   because they have to, because it's
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.600]   like a national requirement.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.760]   But this is so sad.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:40.440]   It's a Canadian company in Waterloo.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.600]   It's my first smartphone.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.000]   Probably all of our first smartphones
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.440]   were Blackberries, right?
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.280]   No, I had a trio.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:46.800]   Trio.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:46.800]   Trio.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.300]   Trio.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:47.800]   Trio.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.680]   Trio 600.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.040]   Well, I had palms.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.080]   I probably had a trio, yeah.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.920]   And then the trio, but the trio became Windows Phone.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.080]   That's right.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.000]   That was awful.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.480]   Yeah, that was the stop gap for them.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.280]   Oh, my god, that was awful.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.360]   You know, rims-- I mean, not to get on a crazy tangent,
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.400]   but that company, the co-CEOs should be fired.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.840]   I mean, these guys are in complete denial.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.680]   Whatever they were able to lead the company to success
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.200]   before, they're clearly not able to take it to where it needs
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.520]   to go now.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.520]   And they're executing way too slowly.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.160]   The products are not exciting.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.000]   And I think they still-- they completely overvalued
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.160]   their core asset, which is basically
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.760]   how well Blackberries do email and the security stuff.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.000]   And I think that they found that consumers are valuing
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   those things differently, and that even the enterprise
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.240]   customer-- and their enterprise customers
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.360]   are able to find-- get parity from other products, right?
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:51.760]   And what I think that they did not count on
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.560]   was that the employee would start choosing the handset,
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.600]   not the employer.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.040]   I think that's what really bragged for them.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.120]   Right, yep.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.760]   Well, it's kind of an IBM Microsoft thing too.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.400]   Well, even Apple, you know, Apple started sneaking
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.440]   into enterprise because employees brought them in.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.360]   Existed, yes.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.640]   And I think that's really what happened as employees said,
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.760]   no, I'm not using that crappy phone.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.480]   I'm using an iPhone.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.880]   Well, as I was saying, it's like you
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.920]   were able to get a quality exchange experience on an iPhone
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.560]   or on an Android phone.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:26.960]   That was critical when that happened actually.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.440]   I mean, I still know people that work at companies
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.240]   and that use Blackberry because their company won't support--
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:33.720]   Well, it's--
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.800]   their CIO doesn't think that Android or iPhone
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.680]   is secure enough yet.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.720]   I believe one of those companies is United States government,
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.400]   which is probably single-handedly keeping rim over.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.400]   That's entirely awesome.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.160]   Let's see.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   All right, I'm going to take a break.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:50.680]   We'll come back.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.960]   We're going to talk about the music store.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:57.840]   We can talk a little bit about YouTube too.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.320]   There's actually quite a bit to talk about.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.480]   This drives me crazy.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.640]   Those poor kids-- I don't know-- the Facebook thing.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.720]   In England, right?
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.200]   Yep.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.440]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   There's two kids who didn't commit--
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.760]   I mean, all they did was they incited on their Facebook page.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.680]   They said, yeah, let's have a Roy at--
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.640]   by the way, the riot didn't happen.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.600]   People who stole TVs got six months.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.760]   These two guys--
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.520]   Four years.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.960]   Four years in jail for going on Facebook
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.600]   and saying, all right, let's have a Roy at--
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   Roy.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.040]   What the--
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.000]   They have a different attitude for a free speech over there.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:40.880]   Yeah, they do, don't they?
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:41.480]   This is UK.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:41.960]   Yeah, they do.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.360]   They cut sentences for three people convicted
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.280]   of handling stolen goods.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.720]   But the guys who made their status update--
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.520]   Party.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.320]   That's it.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.600]   You're out of here.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.440]   Wow.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:02.240]   They said it was utterly shocking and wholly inexcusable.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:02.680]   Wow.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.920]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.200]   I want to-- I was kind of stunning.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.960]   So good to have Jeff Jarvis here from the Buzz Machine,
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.280]   BuzzMachine.com, his new book, Public Parts.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.240]   I'm reading it, loving it.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.800]   It's a manifesto, isn't it?
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.640]   It tries to be.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.480]   For living in public, making the case for something
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:32.080]   that Jeff and I do anyway without a choice.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:32.580]   Love it.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.840]   If you haven't read it yet, get it.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.440]   Get it, Amazon.com.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.320]   Of course, Gina Trippani from Smartawear.org
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.360]   and our good friend Peter Rojas from GTGT.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.720]   He calls it Gadget.com.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.080]   Yeah, simpler that way.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.480]   It is, isn't it?
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.680]   Before we go on, though, I do want
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.840]   to talk a little bit about our friends at Ford, their back,
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.340]   baby.
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.760]   In fact, we're going to have a barbecue soon.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   We're going to have a couple of Ford Barbecues.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.200]   I'll give you the dates and everything.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   We're going to have-- I think we can allow 50 people,
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.160]   we'll have some lottery system.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.360]   And we'll be during the Twit Show on Sunday.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.320]   We'll have a barbecue.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.160]   You'll have all these great Ford cars,
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.960]   and you'll be able to come and see the cars,
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.960]   have some ribs, watch Twit--
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.600]   Riddos.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.400]   Riddos.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.160]   Should we have some Chipotle at the barbecue?
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.600]   I think you should have your own competitive.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.600]   Yes.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.680]   Twitotle.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.600]   Twit-Riddos.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.600]   Twit-Riddos.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.880]   With good guacamole.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.640]   Yes.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.960]   I'm going to get Gina's mom's-- is it your mom or your recipe?
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.360]   It's a-- yeah, no, not my mom.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.800]   My mom's got the Italian down.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.200]   That's right.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   My wife is a--
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.280]   And my wife's opinion made about next-kin,
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:36.720]   so it'll be a reminder.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.000]   No, in fact, you should.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.040]   You should always have an opinion about guacamole.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.800]   Always.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.320]   It's key.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.120]   Salsa and guacamole.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.040]   It's key.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:50.280]   But before we go on with that, let's talk a little about Ford.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.920]   Ford-- actually, I'm sure Ford would love
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.520]   to get Peter Rojas to start covering Ford vehicles
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.240]   as consumer electronics devices.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.040]   Because that's really how they're starting to think about it.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:00.960]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.520]   They just added Wi-Fi.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.480]   So if you've got the available sync in my Ford touch
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.720]   in your car-- and a lot of them do, but I do in mine--
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.360]   you've got a USB slot.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.400]   The edge that I rented in San Diego had two USB slots.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.960]   You take one of those slots, you put one of those 3G cards
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.080]   in there.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:22.880]   And now, the car itself has a Wi-Fi access spot with WAP
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.920]   and everything.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.440]   And now everybody in the car has access to the internet
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.800]   via Wi-Fi through the Ford.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.320]   I mean, it's just little things like that.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.560]   They've got apps now.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.440]   I love the attention to detail.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.240]   For instance, this is something I used in San Diego.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.320]   They-- in my Ford touch, you could set the cruise control.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.440]   But instead of just saying, whatever that is now,
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.360]   remember that, you actually can do it by the speed.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.680]   You can set it to 65 miles an hour and leave it there.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.200]   Or in my case, 78 miles an hour, because I'm a scoff law.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.320]   It's just great.
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.800]   The performance in the engines now, these new electric cars,
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.440]   I'm waiting.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.600]   I'm waiting for that focus.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.920]   You got to try the new focus as that Wi-Fi built in.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.440]   And really amazing, even the gasoline engines, so efficient.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.320]   Ford is taking technology seriously.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:18.520]   You could find out more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.840]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.360]   Just take a look at all the amazing little features
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.800]   that add up to a great automotive experience.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.960]   And really got to try this thing with my Ford touch.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.160]   I had to laugh at Siri, because half the thing
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:32.640]   Siri does.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.000]   I've been doing it in my car.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.440]   Set the temperature for 72 degrees.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.200]   What's the traffic like ahead?
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.160]   Where's a gas station?
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.840]   All this, I could tell my car with Ford's sync.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.040]   It's amazing.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.440]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.560]   We thank them for their support.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:49.880]   And stay tuned for news about the barbecue.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:53.080]   Coming up, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.840]   All right, what else is in the news here?
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.880]   It's really consumed by ice cream sandwich.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.840]   But there are a few other things we could talk about.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.120]   Google is now turning on SSL on all searches.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.240]   That started today.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.480]   Yeah, by default, if you're signed in.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.520]   This is something that probably I
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:19.720]   don't care if somebody spies on my search results.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:25.840]   However, I think it's making a statement.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:26.600]   That's really more--
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.720]   Yes.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.160]   That all web traffic should be encrypted going forward, I think.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.960]   Yeah, SSL as a default versus above and beyond.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.480]   Not just for credit card numbers anymore.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.720]   Right.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.000]   I think our systems are fast enough.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.320]   That's not a burden.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.200]   And it comes at the same time that Google started
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.160]   their Good to Know page, which is about privacy and about all
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.120]   that I think are trying to much harder now.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.280]   I spoke at Google last week, and I didn't even
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.440]   know it was privacy week.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.880]   But they are trying to put out core principles
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.160]   and try to be more protective, I think.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.360]   I think very nicely done.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:02.760]   It is.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.440]   And I'm going to start-- this is good to know page.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.680]   It's google.com/goodtoknow, I think.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:11.240]   I'm going to start referring listeners on the radio show,
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.680]   because that's who-- look, you guys all know all this stuff.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.080]   You know, you use a unique password,
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:17.440]   you use a long password, and so forth.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.840]   But this is a really nice English language,
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:25.040]   not highly engineering way of describing a lot of the things
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.760]   that are really good.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.560]   Like this is a tip I've been using for a long time.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:33.960]   Use a line from a song, film, or play, and use the letters.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:34.920]   I do this all the time.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.400]   It's a really great way to protect yourself.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.960]   And just this makes it accessible and easy.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.720]   So yeah, good for good on Google.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.880]   And I think you're right.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.160]   I think for whatever reason, maybe
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.640]   it's because they're sensitive after the FTC investigations
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.320]   or whatever.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.200]   But for whatever reason, Google's fighting the good fight.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.400]   I think it's because they're engineers,
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.680]   and they know what's right, and they want everybody to do it.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:57.520]   That's what I'm--
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.640]   It's probably a little bit of all of it, right?
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.160]   I want to give them the benefit of that.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.280]   So what do we know about the Google Music Store?
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.560]   We've been using Google Music and beta for some time.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.240]   Still private beta, right?
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.440]   You have to get an invite.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.400]   I believe so.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.640]   I actually would.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:19.960]   But I think it's very similar to Amazon with one big exception.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.800]   You can't buy anything.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.240]   So Google needs to have a store, and the rumors are,
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.360]   all things D says, it's coming soon,
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.720]   and coming soon with a twist.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.280]   Did Facebook do them a favor there?
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.040]   That now you can buy through Amazon,
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.840]   you can buy through iTunes, and now with Facebook too,
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.800]   as a social means of discovery leading to purchase.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.040]   They're kind of foolish to leave Google out now.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.120]   Well, I think the music industry
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.800]   is wanted to balance iTunes dominance for some time.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.920]   Exactly.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:54.960]   So at All Things D, Andy Rubin, who
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.480]   said quite a few things on stage with Walt Mossberg--
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.520]   by the way, Cara Swisher, who was
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.560]   supposed to be on stage for this Asian All Things D,
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.680]   had a little ischemic incident, she said.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.040]   And we wish you the best, Cara, because we love you.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.960]   Scary, but she's blogging like mad from the hospital.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.960]   No, no, no, no.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.800]   Thank goodness.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.480]   You cannot shut Cara Swisher out.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.120]   No, no, you cannot.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.000]   She got her voice back.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.040]   Love that about her.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.680]   Anyway, so she says, make sure when you're a long flight,
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.720]   walk around and drink plenty of fluids.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.240]   I love that she blamed the two big dudes sitting next to her.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240]   That was awesome.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.720]   I could just see that.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.360]   I could just see that.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]   Anyway.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.600]   Got him being hello, ladies.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600]   So she--
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.840]   Anyway.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.080]   So she's not on stage, but Walt is, and Andy Rubin joined him,
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.440]   and he confirmed for the first time
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.120]   that there will be a Google Music Store.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.240]   And I think we're close, he said.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.000]   He says Google will have a little--
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:52.880]   it will have a little twist.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.720]   It will have a little Google in it.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.880]   Whatever that means.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.000]   I thought the twist--
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.520]   I don't know.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.880]   I thought it was a reference to Double Twist.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.440]   Oh.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.280]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.360]   I thought he was just trying to say--
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.200]   Pull that for.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.720]   I don't know.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.840]   I mean, I'm just reading between the lines.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.600]   I don't know if there's anything to that.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.360]   But Double Twist is sort of the client of choice
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.760]   for managing your media if you're an Android user.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.880]   And I actually love--
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.120]   I actually love Double Twist.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.840]   I mean, you can imagine Double Twist
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.360]   combined with Google Music Streaming,
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.560]   combined with an MP3 store.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.080]   Google.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.360]   Google-- Double Twist also has Wi-Fi syncing, which, of course,
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.280]   Apple's touting.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.200]   Finally.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:34.880]   He says--
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.040]   But I have no inside information.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:36.480]   I don't know.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.880]   Oh, I like that.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.880]   Anyway, I like going with that.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.800]   Good rumor.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.600]   Let's start.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.480]   Maybe actually maybe you just started it, Peter.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.120]   Google, what the hell's with it?
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:46.680]   Think of that either.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.200]   Let's buy them.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.480]   That keeps the phone running.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.760]   I don't want to get blamed for it.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.400]   Ryan thought of that.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:52.960]   It's all fine.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.360]   It says that we won't just be selling 99 cent tracks.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.640]   What does that mean?
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.520]   They're selling albums.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.320]   Well, nobody's just selling 99 cent tracks.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.780]   I mean, maybe they're going to do a Spotify competitor.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.180]   Oh.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:11.660]   I don't know.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:12.980]   It's tough because they really, when
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.580]   they launched the Google Music Locker thing,
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.780]   they did that without licenses.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.180]   And they kind of pissed off the label.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.460]   So I'm not sure they're going to be
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.660]   able to pull something like that off.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.260]   But that is kind of the holy grail, right?
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.020]   It's something that combines the locker
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.020]   with the streaming with the store.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.380]   He says they don't get us.
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.820]   Media companies don't get what we're up to.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:39.360]   He compared it to how Apple changed and involved.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.140]   He says Google is evolving as well.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:44.020]   It's in the very, very early phases of adding consumer
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.860]   products to our portfolio.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.900]   The media industry didn't see us as that.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.900]   They saw us as a search company.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.980]   No, actually, we saw you as an advertising company.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.220]   But it is interesting.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.780]   Perhaps-- I don't know.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.860]   Bob had question marks from that.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.420]   I wonder if it'll be a Facebook Spotify type thing
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.620]   where you're on Google+ and you can see what other people
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.620]   are listening-- see what your friends are listening to
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:14.100]   and perhaps stream friends track somehow.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100]   That's interesting.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.860]   I mean, the Android Market has a books tab, a movies tab,
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.740]   and an apps tab.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.020]   I mean, it's really-- it's missing a music tab.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:21.700]   Although, I don't know.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.260]   Maybe this would be completely separate from the Android market.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.140]   What if-- OK, wild rumors.
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.620]   What if they're going to partner-- you know,
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.660]   the Skype deal went through.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:32.820]   Skype is now wholly owned by Microsoft.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.860]   So the founders of Skype are just kind of wandering around.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.860]   They started a new service.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.060]   Remember, they started Artio.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:45.100]   They now have Video, which is a Netflix competitor.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.700]   I love Don Draper just kind of sitting there looking.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.740]   Doing what he does.
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.380]   Thinking.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:51.780]   He's coming up with a tagline.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.060]   Any moment now.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.300]   Looking dashing thoughtful.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.900]   It's like the greatest web page.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.900]   I just want to leave that up.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.140]   Who doesn't want to look down here?
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.460]   Meet version of Gina's being face-be-enpros.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.780]   But everyone's going to scratch his palm and look around.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.180]   It's coming up with brilliant thoughts.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.420]   He's thinking things.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.860]   And the ash never falls.
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:14.180]   And the ash never falls.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.660]   And I can't click anything.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.380]   Well, I can-- oh, wait a minute.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.380]   I can log in.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.180]   So I'm really wondering if maybe something like that,
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.900]   maybe they're talking of movies, TV shows, as well as music.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.100]   And maybe-- and I love the idea of maybe they're talking
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.740]   about a streaming service.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.380]   That'd be cool.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:31.180]   Just a thought.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.540]   We're going to start rumors.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:33.940]   We don't know what they're doing.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.300]   And Andy--
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.660]   I like the double twist from our--
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.540]   I love that.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.860]   I think that's the one we're going to go with.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:39.460]   Oh, we'll see.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:39.940]   We'll see.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.460]   He said it's wheels.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.780]   He said with a twist.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:43.540]   Andy started it.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.780]   And now we know what John Hamm was thinking this whole time.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.660]   I'm sorry, but you can't have this.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.660]   UK only.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.260]   You can't handle the video.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.580]   UK only, oh well.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.860]   I'm just going to leave that on my screen.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:01.060]   I like it.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.860]   He's thinking.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.940]   Moving along here, let's see what else.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:11.820]   You see anything else you really want to talk about here?
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:12.340]   Sure.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.180]   I should-- with the full disclosure
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:17.220]   that I am a nano-micro mini, tiny investor,
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.620]   and at Bill Gross, Uber Media started chime in.
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.820]   Yeah, they have a new site.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.700]   CHIME.IN.
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.060]   Which I think the best way to describe it
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.420]   is that you can--
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:30.900]   I'm probably not supposed to travel this way,
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.140]   but anyway, it's much richer tweets
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.900]   that can still feed Twitter and still feed
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.100]   eventually Google+ and Facebook and so on.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.900]   He made noise for a while about making a Twitter competitor.
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.100]   And Twitter kind of slacking that.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:44.620]   He says this is not.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.460]   This will feed both ways.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.700]   But what this allows, they're pitching this
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.100]   as an interest network so that you can filter better
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.460]   and find your interest better, rather than just
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.460]   following people wholesale.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.100]   So when scoble writes about technology,
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.980]   you can find that part of the scoble.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.700]   And they're smart.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.860]   They got Trey Radcliffe.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.660]   They probably jased him down.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:08.180]   He's breaking up there.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.180]   I think it's me.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.300]   Who's that?
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.580]   All right, I'm going to sign in here real quickly.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.940]   I think it is you, Jeff.
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.220]   No, no, it's not.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.220]   I think it might be Gina.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.980]   I just turned her.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.780]   Is it?
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.820]   Sorry about that.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.060]   Doesn't matter.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.660]   It's your razor burn.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.780]   That's why I got it.
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:35.300]   Hey, somebody already has Leo Laport.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:38.260]   Oh, well, man, it says that we've reserved it.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.900]   I'm sure it's for you.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.420]   Authorize it.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.260]   Oh, you know what they do?
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.900]   They reserve it because it's my Twitter handle.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.700]   So I said it's right.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.660]   That's what they did.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.220]   Yeah, they can't really do the same thing,
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.420]   but they could reserve it so you can have it
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.260]   as important here.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:55.420]   Anyway, I think this is going to be interesting.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.260]   It is.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.900]   And companies can come in and create their own pages.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:02.620]   And you can create a page there where you can sell all the
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.380]   advertising yourself.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.220]   But if you don't sell it, chime in will sell it.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.100]   And they split the revenue.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.060]   Oh, I like Bill.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.220]   He always has a business model.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:10.820]   Leave it to Bill.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.540]   He's got a business model.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.860]   Yeah, it's not going to let that leave that low hanging fruit
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.940]   line there.
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:19.660]   What do you think about Chris Poole?
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:24.700]   Moot, who he said anonymity is important.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.220]   Of course, Moot runs 4chan.
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:32.980]   And anonymity has given rise to, well, some of the most ill
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.580]   behaved people on the internet.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.860]   Well, and he puts it out on Facebook, but then he uses
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:42.420]   Facebook authentication for his new service and says that it
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.660]   does improve things.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.100]   Yeah, canvas is new thing.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.100]   Oh, it does filter out trolls and spammers.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.180]   But he does make a good point.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.660]   We all have multiple identities.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.140]   It's part of being human.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:54.820]   It's good to have options and have multiple identities.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.100]   Facebook and Google, he says, do identity wrong?
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:57.940]   Twitter, does it better?
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.380]   And I want to think about the world,
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.940]   but the world would be if we did it right.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.460]   OK, I'm not sure I'd ask Moot.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:12.740]   Facebook power users have left.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.780]   Twitter says Sean Parker.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.260]   Sean Parker saying that investor for president?
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.700]   What is Sean?
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.860]   He says, Twitter or Google+,
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:24.900]   I thought was weird.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.180]   Are there any numbers to back that up?
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.580]   No, no.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.940]   No, it's perfect.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.420]   Twitter, DiCustalo, announced at web 2.0 that Twitter now
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:41.140]   has 250 million tweets a day.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:45.260]   And because of the iPhone Twitter integration in the new
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.100]   4S that they had tripled the number of signups
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.780]   in the last few weeks, and that this is,
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:59.660]   I thought, the most interesting, 50% of their 100 million users
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.020]   are on every day now.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.500]   So that was one of the things people thought about Twitter.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.700]   Well, there are a lot of accounts,
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.500]   but how much do people really use it?
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.580]   50% every day.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.140]   Wow.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.860]   That is a really high number of active users.
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:13.740]   No kidding.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.460]   That's extremely--
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.860]   And I think a lot of it is the mainstreaming of Twitter,
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.380]   because you see now--
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.300]   I'm shocked.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.500]   Almost every TV show has a hashtag.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:27.060]   Every TV show, hashtag and news people all have their Twitter
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.140]   handle up.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:34.180]   Reality shows, it always seems like there's a hashtag or even
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:37.380]   people watching live and at taking questions while--
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.420]   I mean, even some of the Glee stars do this, right?
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.020]   Like, OK.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:40.620]   You know what's the--
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.380]   You're a freaking game.
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:42.380]   Sorry.
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:43.060]   Drink.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.460]   Well, we already did Chipotle.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.860]   We might as well get Glee in there.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.420]   And now you can really be toasted.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:52.860]   By the way, there was an interesting Reuters article
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.940]   that I think is in the list, the Huffington Post,
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.900]   of a study they did of backing up on Occupy Wall Street
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.860]   hashtag.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.100]   You started it with F Washington, by the way.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.540]   Well, I didn't start it, but it was actually--
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.980]   they were separated at birth.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.380]   It was the first English language use of it.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:09.740]   They said, was just FU Washington
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.860]   and Occupy Wall Street together.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.380]   I remember that tweet.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.700]   Somebody did.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:16.180]   But it's really fascinating to see how it spread and where
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:16.500]   it spread.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.380]   New York has really spread it really rapidly.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.820]   And I love that kind of analysis now of where that goes.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:28.500]   Do you think Occupy Wall Street is our Arab spring?
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   There's got to be a viewing an awful lot into it.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.260]   The problem is--
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.220]   Well, it's not-- it isn't yet.
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:36.020]   Well, no, I think what it is.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:39.940]   It is overarching expression of anger.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:43.380]   And people are frustrated that it has no clear goal,
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:44.500]   but that's the point of a hashtag.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.540]   A hashtag has no owner.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.740]   It has no creed.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.500]   We put into it.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.940]   We want to put into it.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:52.420]   And now I think that the movement, which is a hashtag
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.020]   movement, has to figure out where it's headed.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.500]   I don't think it has to have a set of goals.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.380]   I think it could be a mistake.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.020]   I think it needs to basically have a tweet.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.380]   It needs to have a line.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.900]   One of my colleagues at CUNY said it just
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.420]   should be level playing field.
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.980]   But whatever it is, this is what we want in a society,
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.380]   and we're not there.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.780]   But right now, it's just kind of--
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:14.140]   now it's the object of fun.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.660]   Last night, John Oliver on--
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.060]   I don't know if you can find it quickly.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:20.140]   It was just brilliant on Daily Show,
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:23.100]   went and mocked the human microphone.
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:23.860]   He mocked.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.740]   He mocked.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:25.500]   The human.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.420]   The human.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:27.340]   Microphone.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.180]   Microphone.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.020]   And it was just absolutely brilliant.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:36.340]   And Howard Stern sent down his guys to interview them
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.100]   and asked one of them, why are you here?
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:43.100]   [LAUGHS]
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.660]   You know, and so there's serious anger.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.940]   There's serious issues.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.060]   There's serious stuff.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.460]   And God bless these people for starting it.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.420]   But I almost feel like it's got to move off the street
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.900]   and back on to Twitter for a real discussion.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.820]   Really?
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.420]   Interesting.
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.380]   Somebody said it's very meta.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   Involved.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.620]   It is meta.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.460]   It's somebody in the chat room said that, basically.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.660]   It's the hashtag revolt.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:14.100]   It's easy.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.660]   I mean, let's face it.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.220]   That's a very easy way to protest.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.500]   Just use a hashtag.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.260]   Yeah, it is.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.260]   The proof-- I did it over one.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.820]   I went down there on Monday.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.540]   It was in New York.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:31.620]   And it was cool to see that the place on 4 Square
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.980]   was the hashtag.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:36.140]   There was no-- the name was the hashtag.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.140]   Oh, I like that.
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:37.820]   Just think.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.020]   It was very clear how to talk about it.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.220]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.500]   That's clever.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.700]   Somebody smarts doing all of this.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.220]   Somebody-- yeah.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.460]   Social media smart.
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.660]   Just to let you guys know, it looks like Sergey and Vikram
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.940]   on stage at Web 2.0.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.180]   I'm not sure exactly what they're all talking about.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:56.780]   Oh, maybe they're done.
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.780]   They're done.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.260]   Oh, the chat room's telling me about it.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:13:59.780]   And I saw it.
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:00.260]   I didn't know.
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.260]   I didn't want to send everybody there.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.300]   Well, they're done anyways.
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:03.900]   Good.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.900]   Watch it later.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.620]   I don't watch it now.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:10.100]   Dennis Crowley, this is Web 2.0 Summit.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:15.980]   Dennis Crowley talking says that maybe 4 Square
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.780]   won't be doing check-ins too much going forward.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.820]   Have you guys used the new-- any of you used the--
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.980]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.060]   I love it.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:25.620]   So the--
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.900]   The new-- that radar feature?
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.820]   So the idea is when you turn it on,
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.020]   it lets you know not only if people that you are following
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:37.580]   nearby, but also things on your lists to do.
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:41.220]   And so I've joined a lot of lists because I don't
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:45.340]   want to miss the best ice cream in Southern California.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:45.820]   Right?
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.620]   Or the best guacamole.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:50.220]   But is it great in your battery constantly checking?
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.420]   Is it checking you in?
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.900]   You know, baby, I bought the biggest--
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.020]   I practically carry a car battery with me.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.340]   I don't care.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.500]   I want all those features.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.380]   I don't care.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:03.340]   Battle life, battery life.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.100]   But what does this do for you, Gina?
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.860]   I mean, is it going to be telling the world where you are?
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.260]   All the time?
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.900]   Well, it watches where I am.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.700]   And then--
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.420]   And so Crowley was saying that 4 Square's biggest challenge
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.740]   is getting sort of curious users, turning them
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:18.660]   into active users, right?
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.500]   Because when you go to some place,
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.620]   you have to launch the app.
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.060]   You have to remember to take out your phone,
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:22.900]   launch the app, and check in.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.380]   So going into passivity, right?
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.220]   Where the app just monitors where you are,
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.020]   then lets you know if your friends are nearby or whatever.
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.580]   I have to say, I'd love seeing Leo in my nearby list.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:32.740]   You know where I am.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.240]   I know.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.140]   I was really neat.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.020]   I was really neat.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.380]   And I checked in everywhere.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:38.460]   I do every-- I always check in.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:39.660]   I love doing that.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.780]   Yeah, it's cool.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.700]   But I don't know.
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:48.380]   I still feel weird about having an app map my--
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.900]   unless it's my tracks and I'm saying,
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.140]   I'm going for a run, track where I am, not only the battery
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.180]   issue, but just kind of the--
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:57.180]   I know, I'm going to have to get a privacy
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.100]   of what this public is talking to about this.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.540]   So he was lucky.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.940]   And he throws in Gina, and he throws in two.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.140]   And again, Skype doesn't like.
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.020]   I think as soon as I start talking
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.540]   about creepy privacy, thanks, guys.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.940]   This is a great shot, though.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.740]   You look so cute.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:13.420]   It is.
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.260]   It is.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.420]   So cute.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.260]   I've done worse, I guess.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.300]   I have to say, we are living a terrible time.
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.060]   And I blame you, Peter Rojas, for all of this.
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:25.300]   Because everywhere you go, including San Diego,
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.300]   like the San Diego Zoo, there's giraffes
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:31.340]   mating over there, and everybody's going like this.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.940]   Looking at your phone.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.620]   Yeah, it's funny, because I was a really--
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:39.020]   I had a smartphone in 2003.
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:42.060]   And I remember doing email on the web,
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.820]   and watching video on my phone, and stuff like that.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.820]   And people were like, what's wrong with you?
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.300]   I'm like, you know what?
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.140]   A few years, you're all going to be doing it.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:50.500]   That's the best thing.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.540]   I am future you.
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.140]   And they all are.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:58.620]   It's amazing how people are buried in screens nowadays.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.540]   All right, we're going to get Gina back.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.420]   And we're going to take a break.
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.020]   And when we come back, we're going
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.700]   to get our tool tip and number of the week.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.980]   But first, a tip for you, Netflix.com.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.780]   That's it.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:14.340]   I don't even know why we have to do ads for these guys.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.620]   They decided not to split off the Quixter thing.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.780]   But forget the DVD.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:21.060]   Do the $7.99 a month thing.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.940]   It is the best deal in video.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.140]   Yeah, people say to me, well, they don't have everything.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.020]   But they got so much.
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.060]   Who cares?
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:28.180]   I don't even plan ahead.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.460]   I go home at night.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.020]   I fire up Netflix.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.740]   I just got the Western Digital Live.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.580]   That's got it.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.580]   Apple TV's got it.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.740]   Google TV's got it.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.940]   I'm updating that.
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.540]   Boxy Box has it.
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.100]   Many Blu-ray players, most TVs.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.180]   Of course, your iPad, your iPhone, your Android phone.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.580]   They all have Netflix.
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:48.700]   That means with streaming, you watch stuff any time you want.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.940]   And look at all the great stuff they've got.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.100]   Walking dead, you go back and watch last season
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.980]   before you watch this season.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.140]   30 Rock, The Office, Parks and Rec, Mad Men.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.740]   Great documentaries.
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:04.380]   I am a big fan of the documentaries, most of which
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.180]   you don't get to see.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.620]   And so this is just--
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.980]   it's impulse watching.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.620]   It's-- oh, the kid stays in the picture.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.060]   What a great movie that is.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.820]   There's just so much great stuff here.
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.260]   Would you give it a try?
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.100]   Free.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.140]   No cost.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.500]   Just go to Netflix.com/twit.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.820]   If you decide to keep it, it's 7.
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:25.380]   The art of makeup effects.
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:26.940]   Wow, that looks good.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.500]   $7.99 a month.
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.940]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.980]   And if you already have it, do me a favor.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.140]   Just throw open the window and shout it out.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:37.700]   Tell everybody in your neighborhood.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.100]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:46.340]   All right, Gina Trapani has our tool of the week.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.300]   Tip of the week is--
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.580]   Tip, I'm the tool.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:49.580]   You're the tip.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.420]   If you haven't logged into Google Docs
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:55.180]   and looked at presentations in a while--
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.500]   Love it, I love it, I love it, I love it.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.860]   Yeah, do so.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.780]   Google rolled out a bunch of improvements.
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:02.900]   Live collaborations, you can watch--
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:05.500]   you can build a presentation with your coworkers
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.620]   and watch character by character real-time typing.
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:08.580]   Very wave-like.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.340]   Very regular Google Docs-like right now.
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:15.140]   You can do animations and charts and tables.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.300]   And you can do transitions between slides.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.900]   I can't stand PowerPoint, and I started
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.180]   to use keynote a little bit more.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.060]   But I had to say, now with this upgrade--
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.260]   and you'll get a little prompt when you logged into Google Docs
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:30.220]   and go to presentations to enable the new presentation editor.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.220]   This looks really nice.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:36.340]   So I'm actually not sure presentations has offline.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.220]   This is my only worry about doing presentations in Google Docs
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.580]   is that you're going to get to, you know,
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.900]   in front of the room at the podium
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.780]   and that you're going to lose your connection, right?
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.780]   So I think that's kind of the last thing here.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.620]   But yeah, log into Google Docs and check out the new presentation
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:49.900]   editor.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.860]   It's pretty cool.
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:51.860]   It is very cool.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.900]   I really like it a lot.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.020]   I was so impressed.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:57.580]   And by the way, I love how the Google Docs team or the presentation
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:02.980]   team is using this new blogger template, the dynamic template.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.140]   Isn't it so cool?
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:05.340]   It is beautiful.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:05.820]   It is.
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:10.020]   I spent more time, I think, switching between the layouts
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.740]   for this blogger template than actually reading the post.
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:14.780]   This is really, really neat.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.180]   I really like the magazine version.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.700]   But there's-- on the Docs blog, there's a little switcher.
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:22.380]   You can check out-- I guess these are new blogger templates.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.260]   And in fact, you could turn it on.
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:27.060]   I have a blogger-- actually, it was a blogger account.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:30.220]   I set up to show off Google Waves integration with blogger.
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:32.140]   And so I never use it.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.940]   But now you've got all these--
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.380]   I turn it on in the dynamic templates.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.580]   It makes me want to use it for my blog.
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.660]   Yeah, me too.
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:39.340]   It's incredible.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:41.140]   You could do Flip Card magazine.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:44.260]   I mean, they're very Ajax-y.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.580]   They're really quite beautiful.
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:46.900]   There's the Flip Card.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.500]   Here's the magazine.
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:50.060]   This is all the same blog, same blog content,
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:53.580]   just different CSS styles that they apply to it.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:57.500]   Mosaic, time slide, which is kind of cool.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.940]   So I'm actually kind of tempted to use this for my blog.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.900]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.540]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.300]   I had a panic because it wasn't in the list,
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.340]   but it's all my screen thing.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:09.840]   Goodness.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.300]   Well, when we had three days of no Blackberry in the world,
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:20.020]   one unintended consequences was that traffic accidents
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:24.340]   in Abu Dhabi went down by 40%.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.140]   No.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:30.980]   And in Dubai went down by 20%.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:34.660]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.340]   That is kind of interesting.
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:38.980]   You think it's a bunch of people been typing all this time?
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:39.580]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.420]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.860]   Wow.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:45.980]   I'm going to--
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.060]   Peter, I don't want to leave you out of this.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.540]   If there's anything you-- any tool or tip or something
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.900]   they're having to do with the Google or the cloud
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.980]   that you'd like to share with us--
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.820]   Now I'm under pressure.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.780]   I mean, we didn't prepare you for this.
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:00.540]   And I apologize.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.700]   You know, I just installed the new Dolphin browser on my phone.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.060]   The Dolphin browser HD just came out.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.820]   It's really nice.
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.660]   Really, really nice.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:09.740]   I've been using it for some time.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:10.620]   And it's free.
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.060]   There are actually a number--
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.340]   I use Xscope as well.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.700]   There are a number of good browsers, alternatives.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.860]   That's one thing that didn't Ice Cream Sandwich
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.740]   wasn't it supposed to have Chrome or that was the run?
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:25.100]   It has-- yeah, it seeks your bookmarks to the desktop.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:26.380]   So I use Dolphin.
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:30.060]   I love Dolphin, mostly because you can install a LastPass
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:33.380]   extension in it, which is super useful because I never
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.420]   remember passwords at this point.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.620]   LastPass does them.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:39.340]   But now that the default browser in ICS
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.220]   syncs bookmarks to desktop Chrome, that's huge.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.420]   So that's kind of nice.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.980]   But Dolphin is really cool.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.340]   I've been-- I switched over ever since Eileen and crew--
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:51.300]   the crew convinced me.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:57.020]   So we're now all in agreement that that is the browser to use.
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.020]   Everybody agrees.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.620]   Overwhelmingly so.
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.820]   Overwhelming agreement.
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.340]   I don't like Xscope.
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.740]   Have you tried Xscope?
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:04.780]   I've tried Xscope.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.500]   I've used both.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.180]   Dolphin, you still prefer Dolphin.
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.180]   Oh, I just installed Dolphin HD today.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.220]   So I've got to give it a few days.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.300]   You know, I'm stalling a little bit
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.740]   because I don't have my Galaxy S2 with me.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.260]   And that has this cool program that I really wanted to show you
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:24.180]   that's a heads up display for Android.
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.580]   Now, the program is free.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.140]   They want you to buy a--
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.980]   or they encourage you to buy a little thing to put it
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.140]   on your dashboard.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.260]   But what it does is it's a virtual-- it's an augmented
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:37.980]   reality display that you use when you're driving.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:43.380]   And it tells you how far away the car is from you.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:46.460]   It warns you it beeps if you get too close.
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:52.140]   It's actually watching what's going on outside as you drive.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.300]   And I wanted to show it to you.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.620]   It's called Eye on Road, but I can't.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.820]   So all I can say is download.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:04.020]   It's the letter I-O-N-R-O-A-D.com.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.140]   I guess it really couldn't show you
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:05.660]   because you have to--
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.700]   You're going to get to an accident watching this thing.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.220]   You do.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.380]   That's why you need to get--
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:15.060]   that's why they really encourage you to get the stand.
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:15.780]   Because--
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:18.060]   Oh, that's that looks dangerous as hell.
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.300]   This is crazy.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:21.700]   This uses GPS to do these measures.
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:25.620]   It uses the camera and GPS and motion detection.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.140]   It does image recognition.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.300]   It sees the car.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.780]   It tells you how fast the car in front of you is going.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.140]   How many-- if you have-- it gives you--
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:34.660]   do you have-- see the green there?
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.580]   That's sufficient distance.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.380]   You get too close.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.220]   It sounds like your wife shrieking.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.780]   Well, I don't-- this is--
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.500]   here, let me play-- I guess I can play the video.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.940]   This is actually probably better because I couldn't really
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.740]   demonstrate this in my car, could I?
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.340]   It's free.
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.180]   Audia's not so good on your--
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.940]   It's not very loud, is it?
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.740]   We'll just talk about it.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:00.140]   But so the thing is free, but as I said,
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.340]   what they really is a come on for getting a clamp
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:06.780]   so that you don't, in fact, hold this up as you're driving.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.060]   Yeah, this is a commercial for a clamp and a USB--
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.060]   Right.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.060]   A charger.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.060]   A car charger.
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.060]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.460]   But you know what I-- most-- many people may have these already.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:19.740]   I'm sure Peter Rojas has 15 of them in his gadget drawer.
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.940]   But this is really-- I just think this
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:25.580]   is a very interesting application of what smartphones can do.
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:28.260]   And it's a heads up display.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:32.740]   So-- and let's hope it'll keep you out of accidents.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.500]   Well, it will literally--
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.860]   I just think it's kind of cool that you know how far ahead
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:38.340]   of you that car is.
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.020]   If you can't have a self-driving car,
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:41.700]   I guess this is the best, next best thing.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.940]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.420]   It looks really neat.
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:45.420]   Huh.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.100]   I, on-- and it really is nice to have on a bigger display
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.260]   like the Galaxy.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.260]   It's got to be illegal as hell.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:54.580]   No, you know why?
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:55.100]   The chat room.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:55.900]   The chat room.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:56.420]   The chat room.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.300]   Holy cow, the chat room got it right.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.900]   He said, no, because it keeps you from texting.
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:05.900]   So that's why I saved her.
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:06.980]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:08.700]   Anyway, I just thought that was really cool.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.940]   And it'll tell you if you're drifting out of the lane
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.740]   and all that stuff too.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.260]   I, on-- road free-- try it.
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:18.420]   Give us your impression.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.500]   If you get in an accident, it's not my fault.
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:26.260]   I just-- one of the things I liked about it
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.020]   is that it's an example of how there's
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:30.980]   so much innovation on this platform happening.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:35.380]   Some very interesting things that people are using.
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.540]   Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you've
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:37.300]   enjoyed this show.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.420]   I love doing it every week.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.140]   I look forward to it.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.100]   I missed it last week.
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.780]   I thank Tom Merritt for-- was it Tom who did the show?
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:43.780]   It was a bias.
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:47.500]   I think I asked her for filling in for me last week.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.460]   And I thank you, Gina Trappani, for being here
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:50.940]   and not bugging me in San Diego.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.700]   It was hard not to bug you seeing you so close on 4 Square,
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:55.900]   but I'm glad you had a great day.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.500]   As I said, I waved when I drove by UCSD.
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:26:59.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.500]   Hi, Gina.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:02.180]   I'm glad.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:02.980]   I felt the wave.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:03.940]   It's easy to find Gina.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.380]   She's at smarterware.org.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.300]   And she's also at ThinkUpApp.com.
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:08.820]   Yes.
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.100]   Wonderful person.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:10.860]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:12.380]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.460]   He is the professor of journalism,
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.620]   those lucky kids at the City University of New York.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.580]   He's also blogging at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:22.260]   He's both of you are on Google+ all the time, of course,
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.100]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trappani.
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:28.900]   And the new book, "Must Get, Must Have, Must Buy, Public Parts."
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:30.100]   And I think I'm seeing you again.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.100]   Yes.
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.180]   Triangulation.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:32.780]   Jeff is on--
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.260]   Are you our guest for Triangulation?
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.260]   Oh, sick of me.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:37.260]   Oh, I'm really-- no, no.
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:39.260]   You know, one of the reasons we started to do this--
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:41.740]   we had Kevin Marks last week, or two weeks ago,
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.020]   of course, Mr. Jobs passed away, and we actually
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:45.980]   didn't finish that one.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:48.700]   But I really want to get these guys like you and Kevin,
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.980]   who are so interesting on for the show,
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.340]   so that we can have some time to talk,
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.980]   because we don't really get to talk so much about public parts.
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:57.620]   So this will be fun.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.420]   We'll do public parts.
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.740]   It'll just pretend it's part of your book tour.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.340]   That's fine.
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:01.860]   Thank you.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.660]   That's going to be a good episode.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:03.500]   I can't wait.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:07.140]   That's Triangulation coming up at 7 PM Eastern, 4 PM Pacific,
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.820]   just about an hour from now on Twitter.tv.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.420]   Peter Rojas, thank you for being here, too.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:15.100]   GDGT.com, he's Peter Rojas on Twitter.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.660]   Do you ever use the Google+,?
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.140]   I do.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.420]   I think I have more followers on Google+, now
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.300]   than I do on Twitter.
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.580]   Isn't that amazing how that's happened?
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:22.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:23.020]   Wow.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.180]   I'm not sure who those people are, but--
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.900]   Thank you for following me.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.180]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:31.300]   We'll see you next time we do the show every single Wednesday
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.300]   at 1 PM Pacific, 4 PM Eastern.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:37.420]   That would be 2000 UTC at TwiT.tv.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.900]   Please stop by and say hi.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.940]   And if you would miss a show, I know it's--
