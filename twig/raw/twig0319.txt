[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   As time for Twig this week at Google, this was maybe one of the best shows we've ever done.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.880]   Mike Elgin is here. Matthew Ingrid, Jeff Jarvis. We're going to talk about Google in France.

[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.040]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover the latest. And there is so much to
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   talk about in the Google and the cloud. I hear the dulcet tones of me coming from Mr. I would
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.760]   guess that I don't know who that's coming from, but I would guess it's from Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.920]   He's off-site. Hi, Jeff.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.440]   Jeff, where are you? I'm in Los Angeles at the Century City
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.840]   Hyatt for the Online News Association.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.840]   Oh, no. I spoke a couple of years ago to that. I thought you did. Yes, you did. I don't think
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.680]   I was here. That was a lot of fun. That was in San Francisco when I did it. And it was a great
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.120]   group and solving a thorny issue, especially these days. It's my peeps. It's my tribe.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.840]   Your tribe. Well, I'm glad you could. We weren't sure if you'd make it, but I'm so glad you can.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.440]   Thank you for being here, Jeff. I'm not going to like it.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.360]   Teach his journalism. I did for an earlier flight. I got here and I'm in the room and
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.080]   everything except my Chromebook is working fun. Thank you, United.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.680]   Jeff teaches journalism at the City University of New York. He also blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.040]   And he also has the author of many very important books you must read,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.040]   and all of which you'll find at buzzmachine.com. Also with his Mike Elgin,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.960]   news director here at Twit. He's also an avid Google plus-er. I enjoy it.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.400]   Since we got Jeff on the horn here, I want to mention his book, Photo Bombed,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.640]   one of our first. So we have this thing on Tech News today. Yes.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.000]   How I watch TNT. People take a picture of what they're doing when they're watching TNT and they
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.960]   send it in. And his book, What Would Google Do, is conspicuously present in one of the photos
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   recently. And I suspect a plant. You have a reader. I suspect the invisible hand of one Jeff Jarvis.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.680]   I know this. Can you see Jeff's hand coming in?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:35.360]   The movie front page with the late great David Carr. He used my book as a palm rest for his laptop.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.520]   Not bad. Not bad. That'll work. If you can't read it, hold it. Also with his Matthew Ingram,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.520]   always good to see you now at Fortune for a long time at Gigome. Great to see you, Matthew.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.680]   Thanks for having me. Thanks for coming in. I wanted to mention real quickly because
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:04.080]   Corey Doctorow, our good friend and fighter for freedom, mentions it on his blog. I don't see it
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.240]   on Boing Boing. But we've talked about it before. There is a bill before the 114th Congress. They
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:18.960]   hope to vote on it before the end of the month. S-754, sometimes called the Cyber Security Information
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.920]   Sharing Act of 2015. And this is something we have up to now. I've been fairly, I say we, but the EFF
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.760]   and grassroots act, root activists have been fairly successful in fighting. This is the second
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.520]   time through, I think a couple of Congresses ago, last Congress, I guess they tried to get this
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.680]   through. Mitch McConnell vowed to hold a vote on the bill before the summer EFF and 20 other
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.840]   privacy groups had a week of action, 6 million faxes opposing SISA, which postponed the vote
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:00.160]   until now. But here's something kind of depressing and this is what Corey tweeted and I'm going to
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.360]   send you to the website if you want to find out more. There's a website called ubetrayedus.org.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:17.440]   And it points out that Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Symantec, Oracle, IBM, Autodesk, and Salesforce
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:26.720]   have all been publicly lobbying to pass this bill. It's billed as a cybersecurity bill, but the
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.360]   chief benefit for these companies is it would give them legal immunity if they should share our data
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.120]   with the government and law enforcement and other companies, even if it's in violation of their
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:48.400]   own privacy policy, even without a warrant. So as the company or the group that fight for the future
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.200]   that created this page points out, all privacy policies effectively be meaningless.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.160]   I disagree with his criticism of the companies. Why wouldn't they support something that gave
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.560]   them immunity from prosecute? Let me give you an example. We talk a lot about how we want really
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.520]   stringent laws because in a really bad crisis. Let's say ISIS is about to take over the country
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.080]   or some crazy thing. Of course, companies are going to do whatever it takes to help the government
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.960]   track down in some horrible 9/11 scenario that you can't imagine, right? In violation of the
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.120]   privacy policies, possibly in violation of laws. You don't know what happens with the next
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.000]   administration that comes in, decides to prosecute or whatever. I mean, I just, I think this is
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.320]   something we as the public should oppose. But I can see why the NSA wants it. I can see why the
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.080]   companies want it. There's no downside. It's like if I come to you and say, here's a bill that'll
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.440]   give you $10,000. Do you want to support this? Sure. Yes. I want to be protected from prosecuting.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.080]   Yeah. No. Of course, they're going to lobby in favor of this. But I think it's important to mention
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:57.200]   it only because these companies, particularly Apple, make a big deal about we care about your
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.360]   privacy. You can trust us. And when they turn around and then go to Washington, D.C.,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.800]   and go to members of Congress and say, please, let us off the hook, it kind of puts the lie to that
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.520]   public proclamation. But again, they trust themselves. Yeah, we trust ourselves. But do we trust them?
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.120]   So I understand your point, Mike, which is they're acting in their own self interest. It's really up
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:28.880]   to us to defeat this. And that's why you should go to youbetraydust.org and write to Congress.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:37.600]   You can email these companies. But more importantly, at the bottom, a number, 985222CISA,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.760]   you need to call and contact. Best way to do it in either a call, which is easy,
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.800]   because they can identify that you're from their district. And then they're ready for these calls.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.160]   And they just mark you down a checkbox, mark in the box, or snail mail, because the postmark will
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:00.000]   verify your location. But if your cell number comes from a different area code, they can't verify
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.760]   the thing. Right. So use your landline. If you have a landline, they may have other ways of
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.000]   verifying your location. I don't actually know that. They know where you are. Leo, I think you
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.960]   make a good point. Tim Cook made a huge speech about Facebook and how all these companies are
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.600]   invading your privacy. But Apple doesn't do that. And yet at the same time, they're lobbying for
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   a bill that would allow them to share data and give them immunity from doing so, as long as they
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.560]   argue that it has something to do with cybersecurity. Right. I guess Apple's response, or Tim's response
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.480]   would be, well, we just don't collect that data. So we can't share. I'm sorry. I feel like that's
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.400]   a little disingenuous. We know that they, for instance, have a unique identifier. Use an iPhone.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.480]   I use an iPad right now. I'm using a Macintosh right now. I can't wait till my new iPhone comes on
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.880]   Friday. Are we foolish for trusting Apple with our private information? I think they're probably
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:02.240]   better than average, but they're not as average as very low. It's a great on the curve. Okay. But
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.600]   I think they're better than average. I just, you know, I just think that there's a difference
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.520]   between a law that says that the government can just help themselves to data that or, for example,
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.760]   the encryption issue, I think Apple's been very strong on that. There's a difference between
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:23.600]   agreeing to something that results in data collection beyond anybody's control, and
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.920]   your choices between you can be prosecuted, you can't be prosecuted. The lawyers who were
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.240]   behind this stuff at Apple and other companies are always going to choose that, no, we don't
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.200]   want to be prosecuted side. That's the difference. This is not requiring them to share data.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.760]   It just says that if they do, they can't be prosecuted for it. This thing should go down
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:52.640]   in flames because this is not, this is, it sounds even unconstitutional to me. And it sounds like
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.880]   an end run, most importantly, around all the protections that we've slowly been starting to
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.200]   erect in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations, and this stuff always happens.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.960]   Whenever something is defeated, it'll be back in some other form.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.520]   It's got to be defeated, but I just don't see why the companies wouldn't do it. If I was a lawyer
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.560]   for Apple, I would be in favor of this too. Yeah, you should. Yeah, right. Actually, that's not
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   true. If I was the lawyer, I'd probably make a lot more money if we got prosecuted. But you see
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.760]   what I'm saying. Well, but it also saves money somebody pointed out, saves money in having to fight
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.240]   requests for information. Microsoft's spending a lot of money right now to keep data on an
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   international server. What is it? Where's it France? I can't remember. Yeah. Out of the hands of the
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.880]   US enforcement or is Ireland, Ireland, out of US enforcement, they're going to lose that battle
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.400]   because of the way the laws are constructed. But they still matter in France, where France is
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:59.680]   going up to Facebook, saying in light of the Snowden revelations, you can't go shipping our data off
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:08.960]   to another country. So that fights it going on again. You know, I'm not an anti-government guy.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.840]   I'm getting more sympathy for the folks who say the government should in every respect
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.960]   keep hands off the internet. I was really one of the people in the net neutrality battle who said,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.600]   no, we need the FCC to step in and promote net neutrality. But I was reading a really,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:34.640]   I have to find it a really great talk in San Francisco. And I don't know who it's by. The
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.800]   fella is so unassuming that he didn't actually put his name in it. His blog is is idle words.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.040]   And somebody in the chat room will tell me who he is. But his slide talks a lot about this whole
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:55.280]   thing. And he gives as an exam, you know, the Snowden revelations talks about state surveillance,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.400]   but he also talks about how government intervention is not always going to be good. And he uses an
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.160]   example of the European cookie law. I'm sure you're familiar with this, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:14.880]   And of course, we're not subject to this. But if a law was passed at a site who uses cookies,
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.280]   has to announce that on the site, and we see that a lot in the US now, probably because they do
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.880]   business in Europe. Every every news that you go to in the UK and the U. You have to
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.680]   constantly click off it. Yeah, I know you got cookies. Yeah, I know you got cookies. Yeah,
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.720]   I know you got cookies. Because it's now become a ridiculous legal thing.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.040]   Well, and he points out that really is not has not been a good remedy.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:46.320]   Because if you don't, if you don't like cookies, it ends up really because this,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.760]   well, here's, I'll read it. The European cookie law is a beautiful example of regulatory disaster.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.720]   If I want to visit a site in the EU, I need to click through what's basically a modal dialogue.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.320]   That means you can't do anything else till you click through it. That asks me if I want to use
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.040]   cookies. If I don't agree, this site may be borderline unusable. But close your eyes for a
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.440]   minute. Those of you who feel you really understand the privacy implementation of cookies,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.920]   raise your hands. And thank you. Those of you who raise your hands, see me after the talk,
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.680]   because I'm a programmer. I wanted the earth speaking about this stuff. And I don't fully
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.200]   understand the implications of cookies for privacy. It's a subtle topic. So why is my mom,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.040]   he's from, he's Danish, why is my mom supposed to make a reason decision about it every time she
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.840]   wants to check the news or weather? And I say every time, because the only way European sites
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:41.520]   remembered that you don't want to use cookies is by setting a cookie. So, so people who are
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:47.680]   serious about not being tracked, get asked every single page load, not every single visit to the
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.640]   site, every single page load done poorly. Laws introduced go ahead. This is Mike's point too.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.280]   It's ask covering. Yeah. And it's it's not. We asked we give a chance. Yeah. So write your
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:08.880]   member of your Congress critter as Corey would have it. And say S 754, please the Cyber Security
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.120]   Information Sharing Act of 2015. When it comes up for a vote, it probably will in the next week,
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:27.920]   say just say no. Okay. I just I wanted to launch out with that because I want to make sure that we
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.480]   we covered that. There's so many other things to talk about. Have we really done ad blocking to death?
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:40.000]   Yeah, pretty much. The news hook this week, of course, is Marco Arment, the world famous
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.440]   Macintosh programmer, Tumblr pioneer found, you know, first programmer at Tumblr, wrote a program
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:54.080]   called Peace to Block ads on iOS came out with iOS nine on Wednesday. After three days, number one,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:02.000]   the number one paid app on the Apple store, he pulls it saying, I can't good conscious continue
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.520]   making an ad blocker. He says, this is I'm winning a war. I don't want to fight.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.000]   And it's not that he is against ad blockers. He's written a number of posts saying I'm pro
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.840]   ad blocker, but he realizes that it's much more complicated, right? Then he thought and he doesn't
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:24.640]   want to be the guy doing it. Apple cooperated with him by giving refunds to everybody who paid
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.320]   the couple of bucks. Yeah. And for starters, it's refreshing to see somebody turning down money
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.720]   for Prince of Pen potentially a lot of money. Yeah, I mean, I would, you know, I would have been
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.560]   tempted to go, you know, I'm going to do this, but I think I don't wait a couple of days. I'm number
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.920]   one in the category. Maybe if I just take my time, no, but you know, it's it's it's laudable that
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.240]   he's doing this. And you know, it's still debatable as to whether or not it's necessary to do that,
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.360]   but it's refreshing and rare to see somebody. He used to work for Tumblr. He's been around for a
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:01.840]   while. And he had a big hit on his hands and he basically walked away from it. Very cool. The
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.960]   problem with ad blocking, of course, is that some ads are good, some ads are bad. This is a blunt
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.080]   weapon. That's the real problem. I agree. That's a great. I'm working on a piece of the airplane
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.760]   coming out just arguing that we have to reform advertising that we have been complicit with
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:24.480]   the advertisers and irritate our own users losing their own trust. The ad blockers just tell us
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.320]   that users say enough and they're going to have it. And we've got to fix that. If there's maybe
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.600]   maybe time left, Randall Rothenberg, the head of the interactive advertising bureau had a big piece
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.440]   in the ad age today, arguing oddly similarly, saying that too much of advertising is crap and
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.840]   that we've got to improve the standards. Clearly, I think what we need is a kind of ad blocking that
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:49.040]   incentivizes quality advertising. I don't know how to do that. Well, and that's what ad block was
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.960]   trying to do with the central blads policy. Although you might say they were also trying to make a
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.000]   little money on the side because they'd go to companies like, no, it's worse than that. It's
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.280]   racketeering. It's blackmail, bribery, racketeering. They go to Google and say, for a small fee,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.600]   you could be one of the acceptable ads we do not block. And of course, Google paid for that.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.360]   That's a nice ad work network you got there. You shame if anything would have happened to it.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:18.880]   All right. Well, but on the other hand, that is a response to that specific need, which is,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.560]   how do we block just the really the malicious ads, the reprehensible ads, the ads that triple
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.360]   our downloads, that slow down our pages? How do we block those nasty ads?
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.680]   Or how do you turn around and how do you go to sites that that fact product courage,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.280]   what do we define good advertising? What's the definition of quality advertising?
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.240]   Now, I argue that it's got to be relevant. Number one, useful and informative. Number two,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:50.400]   but and or engaging. There's things that can't do. It's a long list of really irritating things
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:57.040]   like autoplay video and taking forever and loading to be data points and being not transparent.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.200]   That's all the negative stuff. On the positive side, I think it's possible that you have a world
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.040]   of consensual advertising where you look at the audience, be fully in charge and say,
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.960]   what advertisers, I won't allow here and I won't be seen. That gives a message right back to the
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.680]   advertisers saying your ads are crap. We don't care about the irony of it was, of course, that
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.960]   the ad blocker that Marco was using, he was using the ghostry database blocks ads on Marco's
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:27.360]   site, John Gruber's site, the deck is the network at blocks. The decks as as unobtrusive and add.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.680]   I mean, look at daring fireball. This is ad supported by a little time. Now, remember,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:41.040]   it's one person. So this ad is sufficient. If you're if you're mobile nations and running iMore.com,
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.560]   you're going to need a few more ads than that to support your much larger.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:53.200]   To me, the solution, I'm starting to step on you there, Matthew. The solution is pretty obvious,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.520]   actually, I think that the ideal ad blocker would basically be something like a Chrome extension.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.640]   You click on an ad when you don't like it, right? Or you write, or you make it a kind of affirmative
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.440]   op-in thing. But then what it does, of course, it needs cookies for that. But then what it does
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.400]   is it asks you, you don't want to see any ads on this site. You don't want to see any ads from
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.360]   this company. Like you get to choose the category of what you're blocking. I don't want to see.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.160]   You also need to take away the moral hazard that exists for both Apple and Adblock Plus.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.360]   I think if anything is going to be a not-for-profit separate entity,
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:37.440]   like Wikipedia, it has to be that because the present players in ad blocking have a moral hazard.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.720]   Actually, let me let Matthew talk and then, poor Matthew, you're at a disadvantage.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   But then I want to read something from Seth Godin post on ad blocking. Go ahead, Matthew.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.840]   Yeah, I was just going to mention that it's not just advertising that people are using ad blockers
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:20:00.800]   for. It's partly tracking. And so what irritates a lot of people is all the cookies and hidden
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.320]   trackers that get loaded by websites that they aren't made aware of. They don't know where their
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.360]   information is going. They don't know who it's being shared with. So it's not just the ads. It's not
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.800]   just that they look uglier, that they take a long time to load. It's all the other stuff that's
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.680]   propagated by those ad networks and by those publishers.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.080]   Nobody questions that it's the advertisers and the ad networks that got themselves into this
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.920]   one in the first place. Here's what Godin says. "Ad blockers undermine a fundamental principle
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.320]   of media, one that goes back 100 years, free content in exchange for attention."
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:42.160]   The thing is the FCC and I'd say the FTC kept the ad part and check with TV
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:50.720]   by limiting the number of ads and verifying the veracity of ads. Paper costs did the same
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.600]   things for magazines and newspapers. You can't put an infinite number of ads in a newspaper.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.480]   It costs you too much. But on the web more and more people have come to believe the deal doesn't
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.000]   work and they're unilaterally abrogating it. They don't miss the ads and they don't miss the
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   snooping of their data. I think that's a fairly succinct description of it. Ads,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.440]   you know, ad supported free media has a long and I'm not respectable but at least a long tradition.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:25.200]   And when TV works on radio, it works for us. But what happened is people on the web went
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.680]   crazy. Advertisers. So we've got to create a new scarcity around quality. That's my argument.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.560]   If you read what says the point is scarcity went away, abundance is what killed the old model.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:40.320]   We quality media outlets have to create a new scarcity. And you're an example, Leo.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.440]   You're exactly the example. You turned down advertisers. That's why I had that discussion
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.840]   last week because I wanted to hear your view on that. But the biggest problem is
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.680]   Ben Thompson pointed this out in his Stratecary newsletter. The biggest problem is that advertising
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:02.000]   and media used to be joined at the hip because they served similar purposes or they shared they
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.560]   had a shared goal. But that's not the case anymore. So the advertisers can get the things they want
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.200]   in other places from social networks, from Facebook, from different platforms. They don't,
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   their desires are not aligned with those of media websites anymore. That's the problem.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:27.520]   So you either have to figure out how to align your desires with those of advertisers or vice versa
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.400]   or you have to figure out how to make money without ads. It's kind of funny that there's a
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.640]   a Chrome extension created by an artist named Darius Kazemi called the ethical ad blocker.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.320]   And basically what it does is it asks you if you want to block the ads on a site. And when you say,
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:49.520]   yes, it won't show you the site. It just says, no, it's not to see this point.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.520]   The ironic thing is a lot of ad blockers do that to sites already. I've had people tell us that
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.920]   fortune, if they run an ad blocker, they don't see anything. It don't see any content at all.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:09.200]   CNS started doing that with videos. We had been, sorry, Drew Curtis, the CEO and founder of
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.240]   FARC.com on, because he's running for governor, by the way, of Kentucky. And everybody should
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.480]   vote for him, even if you don't live in Kentucky. But if you run an ad blocker when you go to
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.520]   FARC.com, it actually does a nice thing. I have turned it off, by the way, I use an ad blocker
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.160]   called UBlock Origin. And because I've turned it off, I'm getting a Spanish ad for carefree
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.000]   panty liners. Not something I'm probably interested in.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.640]   Product. Yeah. And Hulu. But if I turn on the ad blocker on FARC.com, he does, I think the best,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   probably the best thing a publisher could do. First thing he has, don't like ads,
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:53.120]   try Bear FARC. In other words, buy a subscription of FARC as little as a couple of bucks a month.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.600]   And then a little banner at the top. FARC feeds their squirrel with revenue from ads.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.160]   Could you consider Bear FARC? No ads FARC. This comes up because I'm running an ad blocker.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.680]   I still have access to all the content. But just a dental nudge in the direction of paying.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:15.920]   And one thing publishers don't do, they don't give people who do pay no ads. So if you subscribe,
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.560]   you still get ads. Right. Well, he says he'll give you Bear FARC, an ad free FARC.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.600]   Right. Well, Matthew, but you've always paid for newspaper and got ads.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.240]   Right. Right. But I'm saying just because that worked when paper owned, everything doesn't mean
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.440]   it's going to work now. It's annoying. I don't want to see those who say, oh, if they only
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.680]   give me a chance to pay, then that will solve it all. I completely disagree. People who say,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.640]   I'll pay will not pay. There was going to be a real difference. We've got, we've got it up.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.480]   You bug, but didn't marketplace now. We've got to deal with that. And we can't afford
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.680]   to give up on advertising. There simply is not enough generosity from individuals or foundations
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.720]   or God help us governments to support the journalism we need. But I think what's going to happen is
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.920]   this is going to focus even more attention on native advertising because it's one of the few ways
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.720]   where you can theoretically align the interests of your readers and the interests of your advertisers
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.920]   and you know, you really do as fool your readers and now the ad blockers. I don't think so. I don't
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   think it has to be that way. Yes. I think sometimes I don't think it has to be.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.240]   Post-up. You know, you know what? Here's my idea. I've got a very simple idea to have
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.480]   us all publishers. Serve all your content from the ad server.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.120]   Yeah, but then you don't, then you don't get, you don't know how many hits you get. You don't
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.960]   know how many impressions you get. The editor will sort of say, if you serve your content for your
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.880]   ad server, or the other way around, not serve your ads from your server, serve your content from the
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.160]   ad server. So your content gets blocked. That'll show you.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.240]   Well, native editorial. That actually, oh, that's where we're headed, by the way.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.520]   That's the be all ads with a little editorial and that's usually paid for by
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.600]   advertisers. But I think one thing that does do is it pushes more publishers towards Facebook
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:05.360]   because, and Apple, if they go to Facebook and Apple, they get a share of that advertising
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   revenue, they don't get blocked. By the way, isn't that interesting? What are coincidence that
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:15.280]   Apple, which of course fuels this whole conversation, I mean, this ad blocker has been around forever,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.840]   but nobody used them until Apple put it in iOS's and now everybody's using them and aware of them.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.560]   And I think the awareness that's happening now in iOS is going to spread to every other platform.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.400]   So suddenly we have ad block ellipse was isn't it interesting that Apple does have its own ad
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:34.560]   platform. I had and it happens to work in news. Did you go to Wired earlier this week? If you
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:41.040]   went to Wired.com, one of their top stories, it said, this is, oh, this pissed me off. This said,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:47.440]   you can't read this story on the web. Go to iOS's news app and read it and we'll put it up on Tuesday.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.160]   That is the upshot of this one of the upshots and that is
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.360]   representsable. It's killing it's killing an open web in favor of a gated community.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.600]   That's why we need advertising. Advertising is what gives us freedom.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.240]   Alan Rusperger, former editor of The Guardian, points out that it was advertising that saved us
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.680]   from ownership by political parties and patrons and special interests. If you get to a network,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.200]   whether the rich could afford it and the rich could subsidize it, then we're going to be right
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.720]   back in that world where we get Donald Trump brings to the news.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:28.000]   I've been thinking a lot about this in general and let me see if I can express this.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.040]   I feel like the human mind is really going in one direction or the other. It's either
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:40.960]   opening or closing. You're either in a kind of the most classical sense, liberal, opening to new
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:50.400]   ideas, tolerant, expanding, or you're closing. The United States had a couple of, and it's very
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.240]   easy, by the way, there's a lot of inertia and momentum in this. It's very easy to kind of get
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.960]   in the wrong direction. We had a couple of nudges in the direction of closed with 9/11
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.360]   and then with the Snowden revelations, which moved a different group of people toward closed,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   but both of those things have pushed the Snowden revelations. Suddenly, I got everybody worried
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.120]   about privacy and 9/11 got us worried about terrorists. What's happened is once you get
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:23.760]   nudged in the direction of shutting down, eliminating the other, I don't want to hear challenging ideas,
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.880]   I don't want to be exposed to the other, I want to be in my cocoon, you move into basically a gated
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:36.480]   community. That's the move towards shutting out the other, getting kind of a homogeneity of experience.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:42.160]   Apps are the ultimate gated community. They're the opposite of a free and open internet. They're the
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:48.560]   controlled community where you don't have to be challenged. The problem is that this
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:57.040]   vicious circle, the more close you get, the more you move in that direction. I really fear that
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.160]   that's one of the threats that is a really kind of a significant deep sociological threat is that
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.960]   we're moving toward the gated community. Apps started that. That's not what you want. You want
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.480]   a wide open internet. Yeah, you know what, things are going to happen on the internet.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:20.640]   What subsidizes that open web advertising? Part of the problem with the adblock discussion is
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.400]   that advertising has been completely demonized and the ad industry didn't help because they
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:30.400]   irritated the hell out of everybody who could ever be a customer. Now, the irony is that you want
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.720]   the close mind with advertising and you want the open mind with the editorial. For example,
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.960]   you don't even want to consider the panty liners. The mind is closed on that product category.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.040]   I'm not going to be using those. But what we do want is to return to a certain extent.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.240]   8-day app from state surgery. What we do want is to return to the newspaper model where the
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.880]   newspaper was always throwing articles that you didn't know you wanted to read. One of the problems
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.120]   with algorithmically sorted content is it just tells you what you already want to know. In fact,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.680]   people are inclined in that direction anyway. People read the news because they want their
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   existing opinions validated more than challenged. So we need that combination. Close mind on the
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.440]   advertising. In other words, high quality advertising. Open mind on the editorial,
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.520]   which is high quality editorial. Well, the risk with Facebook is that walled garden.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.280]   It's a little like apple. It's a beautiful garden. The flowers are really nice and you can hardly
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:28.160]   see the walls and no one comes up and tries to pickpocket you or whatever. But you don't know
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.880]   what the rules are of the garden. Only Facebook knows what is shown to you when. Don't worry,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.760]   you're pretty little beard about that, Matthew. It's going to be nice. It's great. This is why I
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.400]   argue that we have to negotiate with Facebook for some small measure of user interest data so we
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.600]   can also serve people on our own and know they don't want to give that up because it's the pot of gold.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.720]   But if we're really going to have discussions about Google and Facebook,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:58.400]   truly supporting news, it has to mean that. It has to mean more. So what is the Washington Post
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.640]   getting for giving 100% of its content to Facebook? I don't know that they didn't negotiate something
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.240]   special. Well, and it's Jeff Bezos, remember, that probably had a hand in that.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:13.040]   There was a lot of people everywhere. Of Amazon, he bought the Washington Post. Peter Kafka was on
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:18.720]   TNT today talking about this. And his basic view is that Jeff Bezos is directive for the Washington
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.960]   Post is if it's digital, jump on it. We want to be all over it. In fact, Amazon.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.200]   I don't care if we lose money at this point.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.160]   Right. Because isn't that Bezos? How Bezos built Amazon?
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.840]   Exactly. Ten years of losing money.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.160]   Yeah, they can afford to afford to.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.040]   But my friend, though, they can afford to.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.240]   Wow from the Guardian. Sorry, Matthew.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.040]   No, no, you go ahead. I'm done.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.920]   Matthew's too nice.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:43.760]   Are you orchard nice? My friend Wolfgang Blau from the Guardian, who's a brilliant editorial
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.800]   mind has been arguing on Facebook lately that between the discount deal that Bezos has given
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.520]   Prime users for Washington Post, which got me to subscribe.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.960]   Yeah, by the way, putting all their articles onto Facebook, he says that very, very soon
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.120]   Washington Post is going to be bigger in traffic and audience than the New York Times.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.720]   I think it will. It's getting close for sure.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.360]   How much does it cost if I'm a Prime member to get the Washington?
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.840]   $49 a year. Still too much.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.800]   There is. I take the New York Times. The New York Times is like $600.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.480]   $400. Yeah, but I buy the Sunday Times and then I get access to everything else.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.920]   I do too. Yeah.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.480]   And I do buy the Wall Street Journal because that makes us money.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.920]   Yeah. So I can justify spending money to make money.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.240]   You know what I did in the experiment, Leo?
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.840]   This is why this is why I'm against the idea of micro payments.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.440]   My journal subscription lapsed.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.760]   So I said, let me see how it goes as free free months.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.240]   And I'll see if there's a story I want. I'll first see that somebody else already write that story.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.000]   99 times I have 100 the same information as elsewhere.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.680]   The one time when I met with that story, of course, I could cheat around.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.000]   But that's the time if micro payments existed, they'd get $1 for me.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Not $900. And so this idea, well, people should just pay a little bit for their content
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.080]   and everything will be okay. Just a dollar here, dollar there.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.680]   Not going to work.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.560]   No, because nobody wants 18 different bills for a dollar here, a dollar there.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.720]   You know, Zane up. I think you know her.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.600]   Just Zane up too.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   Fekki.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.440]   I guess you're with her.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.000]   I guess you're with her.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.480]   That's me.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:18.400]   She wrote a piece on Medium about how which she would like is for a whole bunch of media
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:24.800]   entities to get together and have a sort of Spotify where you could subscribe to one thing
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.560]   and then get articles from all kinds of different publications.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.640]   Kind of a Google contributor, isn't it?
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.400]   Well, it is more organized than that.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.560]   It's more similar to something called Blendell, which is based in the Netherlands
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.440]   and has expanded to Germany and wants to expand to the US.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.640]   So they sign up a bunch of publishers.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.560]   You say, I want to pay, or publishers say people have to pay three cents for an article.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.240]   So then you just pay for the things you want.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.680]   I think that's a great model.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.200]   And I think it would be great if we had one.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.200]   I don't think enough people will pay.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.440]   It might be a little bit better.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:09.760]   So Alexander Klipping, who's the founder of Blendell, said that 100,000 people in his
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.840]   nation of 16 million had topped up their Blendell accounts within a year.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.560]   That's the one metric.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.240]   So OK, that's nice to set up.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.920]   How much money have you paid out to publishers?
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.840]   And what's the average payout for readers?
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.400]   He won't say.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.120]   He won't reveal.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:26.320]   And I do know that, well, I think I know from speaking to people at these companies,
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.320]   the New York Times is experimenting with it, Wall Street Journal's experimenting with it.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.760]   These are, you know, they're testing the water because it makes sense to do that.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:41.920]   But I don't think it's ever going to be that model is ever going to be a big enough contributor
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   to say do without advertising.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   Well, again, I think it'll hurt the journal.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.600]   I think the journal of New York Times and the Financial Times are very high price subscriptions.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.880]   And if I could get the occasional article that I uniquely want there,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.400]   for a fraction of the price, most people would.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.480]   I mean, also for the New York Times, no matter what.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.200]   But for the, you know, I don't subscribe to the FT and the F.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.560]   He does have articles on whatever it would.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.200]   It's a while.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:05.760]   And I get stuck.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.200]   It's interesting if you look at the New York Times, they've already,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.600]   they're effectively watering down their own paywall by giving access to people through other means.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.080]   So you can get more articles through New York,
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.560]   and why T now, the app, you can get articles through Facebook, instant articles.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.520]   They're effectively, they're cannibalizing their own paywall.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.040]   All right.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.120]   Well, I just paid the $10 a month.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.480]   That's the, you don't have to pay that much in contributor, but that's the max you can pay.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.640]   Are we just to get this straight?
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.400]   Are we arguing for or against that blockers here?
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.760]   Who's who's for ad blockers?
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.480]   Who's I'm in favor of them?
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.120]   I use them.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.240]   I don't, I don't actually use them.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.880]   But you're favor.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.000]   Well, I'm in favor of people using them because I'm in favor of publishers and advertisers getting
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.560]   the message.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.280]   Right.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.600]   And the message is you have to try harder.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.000]   I am against them, but I use them.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.720]   Just to balance you, man.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.840]   So, and who's against ad blockers?
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.240]   Jeff, Jeff.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.680]   Even though I know that's hypocritical because I've had, back in the days, kids,
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.360]   we had these things called BCRs, and it was wonderful when you learned how to skip commercials,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.680]   and I've got commercials on my DVR, same thing, right?
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.000]   Sure.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.040]   And I think it's a little bit disingenuous.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:30.800]   You don't publishers, for publishers to say, you know, you have to, in order to support us,
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.080]   you have to submit to any kind of terrible advertising that we think is,
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.680]   you know, that we've convinced ourselves is worthwhile.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.920]   That's not a deal anyone would agree to.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.520]   And that's kind of the main reason that I'm finally saying, you know what,
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.240]   given all of the hazards of the current ad model, it's not unreasonable for somebody
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.120]   who's an ad blocker.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.920]   You just can't blame them for doing that at all.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.720]   So that's what we have to fix if we have time.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.760]   My, I really didn't want to get into this conversation,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.600]   but it really is, it's a great discussion for a variety of reasons.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.280]   So what the heck?
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.080]   But one more thought.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:16.960]   Here's my, my actual fear as I think about this is not that good sites are going to go away,
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.800]   but that we're going to get an escalating war, an arms race between ad blockers and ad tech.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.480]   And I think that's really history tells us what's going to happen because
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.640]   this isn't the first time ad blockers have become universal.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:36.320]   Remember when pop ups are so awful that every browser worth its salt blocked pop ups.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.720]   And they all do still.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.440]   So what happened?
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.360]   Well, the ad tech just advanced effect.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:47.440]   That's one of the reasons ad tech is so offensive now is to get around pop up blockers and things
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:47.840]   like that.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.400]   And there's no reason to think that there's any technological.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.360]   No, so that's what we need human standards to say, sorry, you can't advertise.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.080]   Just as you do Leo, you can advertise here.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.680]   If you're going to do X, Y and Z.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.160]   Right.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.080]   And that hurts when we're losing money.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.440]   We need publishers to do that.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.120]   We do need publishers to value.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.840]   We do need that.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:12.480]   And they don't gather together to create a, say to ask for, I don't think,
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.320]   she's brilliant, but I disagree with her on this one.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.080]   They don't gather together to create an antitrust.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.640]   Well, they gather together for standards of quality.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.520]   And then at some point people, the reasonable people would say,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.000]   not unlike when Apple allowed you to buy music.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.680]   Reasonably I'll buy music now.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:34.000]   Well, in the IAB, their tech lab said that they were considering suing ad blocking software
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.880]   companies.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.240]   Like, that's a great strategy.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.520]   Oh, that's a great strategy.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.960]   That's the record industry model.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.760]   Right, exactly.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.360]   Have they not been paying attention?
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.120]   I mean, this is not a great strategy.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.920]   I should mention I was at the IAB upfronts last week.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.040]   And some people thought that was an endorsement of the IAB.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.440]   We are not members of the IAB.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.400]   And for--
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.600]   Yeah, I have a good organization.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.480]   Yeah, I didn't want to--
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.280]   I didn't want to join an organization that might-- things like that might happen.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.400]   No.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.360]   So--
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:07.760]   If you--
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.240]   Well, and let's face it, some members of the IAB,
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.800]   ad tech is their business.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.200]   Right.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.080]   Lots of them.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.880]   And some of our--
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.160]   If you look up ad age, Randall Rothensberg's piece,
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.400]   this is not necessary internet apocalypse.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.440]   And I don't think he goes far enough.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.800]   But he says that-- where is it here?
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.920]   The rapid race for first party data has to slow down.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.880]   Ad should only load when they're about to be-- load when they're
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.240]   about to be able to hold up before.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.640]   Advertisers and agencies should voluntarily abandon the worst forms of digital disruption.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.600]   Amen.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.840]   Publishers should take control of their side experiences.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.880]   Those are his four rules.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.040]   It doesn't matter at this point.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.600]   Too late.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.400]   I will.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.120]   Oh, well--
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.040]   It has to be here to stay.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.840]   Okay.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.600]   That's also the same thing.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.800]   Ad blockers are here to stay.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.320]   It's too late.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.840]   Effectively, this debate is--
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.160]   Yep.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:02.720]   --it's over.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.320]   They should have done that two years ago.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.040]   Because you know what?
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.880]   Everybody's using ad blockers.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.200]   Period.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:07.680]   Well, we're--
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:13.840]   Not to mention advertisers are going to social platforms like Facebook.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.600]   Publishers with their own websites will be left to soak up whatever
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.880]   drags they can.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.760]   Well, not only if that's the business we put ourselves in,
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.480]   then we end up doing-- that the world is buzzfeeding cats.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.120]   Yes.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.720]   I'm not ready to give up, gentlemen.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.360]   I am not ready to give up on quality media.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.480]   I think that there's room for quality.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.520]   --one more into the range.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.200]   There's room for quality media.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.160]   They're going to be--
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.320]   The problem is they won't be large enterprises.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.640]   There'll be individual small enterprises
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.520]   that can do first party ads that can figure out a way,
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.760]   like I have, to do advertising and a respectful way to your audience.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   I take the New York Times and Conde and ask
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.960]   to places like that to figure this out.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.120]   I wonder how, though, with that ad blocker and--
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.680]   And the court.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.120]   --of the fact-sorted courts.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.080]   --sex-a-worded courts bragged properly.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.000]   The courts has no networks, no IAB units.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.920]   All they have is very well-labeled, uh, uh,
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.000]   native and, uh, other kinds of-- of advertising.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.120]   They sell specially.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.880]   And, uh, you know, they're not so much of this mess.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.120]   Right.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.560]   So the risk is-- when I started talking about the same thing,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.960]   the risk is smaller.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.960]   I would let's, like, say the all, for example.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.040]   Um, they don't-- they don't have the resources to create
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.880]   really good native advertising.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.400]   They don't have the resources to do deals with Facebook and other platforms.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.040]   So they're gonna get-- the argument is they're gonna get--
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.720]   they're gonna disappear.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.520]   In fact, they're gonna be--
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.960]   They'll be in the Facebook deals.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.760]   That-- that--
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.920]   Facebook's gonna open up for those kind of guys.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:42.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.800]   Um, uh, Facebook said it.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.080]   That they're-- that they're expanding.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.840]   That what they have now is just the beginning.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.040]   They've already started expanding.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.080]   They'll expand to the beer guys and the smaller guys.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.800]   But that's the case where you have a quality network.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.640]   The all and name five other great blogs could join together
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.240]   to take their quality audience, their hip quality audience,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.040]   and create stuff from a place like narratively or-- or contently.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.000]   And, uh, no, I think that's possible that you could do that.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.320]   You're right.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.440]   The all on its own camp.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   But, um, because advertisers are still stupid, they still want mass.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.480]   Problem with all of this is that advertisers are dumb and slow
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.960]   and nobody wants to argue with them because they have the money.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.640]   By the way, as Dallas points out in our chatroom,
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.080]   Wikipedia still doesn't have ads and survives.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.360]   And there are places on the web that preserve the ethos of, uh, of the web from the--
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.320]   They got a beg for it.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:36.800]   They got a--
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.000]   I give them money every month.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.200]   I'm glad to give them money.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.360]   There aren't enough people like you, Leo, given them money.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.520]   I think it gets harder and harder with that model.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.080]   I guess so.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:44.560]   Over time.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.200]   Boy.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:45.760]   Uh--
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.400]   You know, I think I'm entitled.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.880]   It is the-- it is the shining example of what the internet--
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.920]   You know, someone else in the chatroom made a good point, which is that
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   a lot of what is out there content-wise is--
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.360]   I mean, there are a thousand websites writing fundamentally the same thing.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:01.680]   Same thing.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.200]   Us the same thing.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.680]   Yes.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:08.160]   And so why would anybody even consent to view ads to read that?
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.600]   Like, there's no-- like, you would have to pay people to read that.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.160]   So why--
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.920]   Business Model--
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.320]   Because the business model is still a volume based--
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.280]   You're absolutely right, Matthew.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.920]   Highballs, exactly.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.800]   Exactly spot on.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.120]   And it's also terribly inefficient because we all write the same stories.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.520]   We do it to get our own page for you to get our own ad
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.640]   because we're in a volume based business, not a value based business.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.360]   And that's what we have to change at the fundamental level.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.440]   The old report is not in the volume based business.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.920]   Leo has said he doesn't want an audience with a 250,000 for a given show.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.800]   Oh, I wouldn't mind.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.880]   Right, but the problem is you do it to the advertising.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.840]   Oh.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.280]   No, I never-- I say that.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.440]   The problem is you go to an advertiser and you say, wow, I've got these
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.760]   1,100 really quality readers.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.520]   And they say that's super great.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.800]   But we're going to go with the other site that has 75 million unique--
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.720]   There's also two-- it's too hard for them to buy onesie, two zeros, that.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.680]   It's a great client.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.200]   And no agency wants to deal with that.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.320]   In fact, it's the problem we face.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   We're not big enough to get a lot of agency buys because it's not worth it for the agency.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.840]   Their commission is not big enough to buy ads from Twitch.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.600]   And in fact, you could argue-- and I have argued-- that ad buyers are the problem.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   I agree.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.160]   That's a serious advertising.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:23.680]   Because ad buyers just want to check a box so that then they can make a report to the brand.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.920]   Got this number.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.360]   And speaking of moral hazard, the more they sell, the bigger commission they make.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.320]   That's all right.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.880]   Well, take a break.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.680]   We've got to talk about the other things as well, including the rights to--
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.120]   I think you didn't want to talk about it.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:37.680]   I really didn't.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.160]   I'll wait for it.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.560]   But it's a great subject.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.720]   And I think it's an important subject.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.040]   I think the war is over.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.640]   I think ad blockers are here to stay.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.160]   I'm very interested in what will happen next.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.680]   Every story, including the one you just about teased there, is all about the future of the
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.080]   internet.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.440]   These are big, big questions.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.480]   What's going to happen?
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.280]   Whether ads exist or not, whether content exists or not.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.720]   And this right to be forgotten thing.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.160]   This is a big one.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.120]   Oh, I'm worried about this.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:03.840]   We'll talk about it.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.840]   And I'm sure Jeff will turn on a little finger.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.800]   Oh, no.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.080]   I'm worried about the falls.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.440]   The five referrals.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.480]   Hey, don't skip this ad.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.760]   Gaga, this is an ad that could keep your home safe, your family safe.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.640]   It's something fun and easy and simple.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.160]   If you're a geek, you're going to love it.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:30.400]   Ring the ring video doorbell at ring.com/twig.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.240]   So I have one.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:32.800]   And I love it.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.400]   In fact, I should fire it up because--
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.120]   So here's the deal.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.080]   This is a doorbell that replaces the button on the front door.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.640]   If you have a wired doorbell, it's easy to remove the old one.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.520]   I removed two screws, popped it off with a screwdriver.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.120]   There's two wires coming out of a hole.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.160]   They give you everything in the ring box, by the way,
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.880]   to do all of this, including just configure and start up the ring doorbell.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.280]   Once you do it, there's this screwdriver.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.080]   You got the level.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.520]   You got the drill bit, everything you need.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.640]   They give you everything.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.080]   And they give you a whole tool set.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.040]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.600]   I know I kept the screwdriver and all that because it's useful.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.720]   And the little bitty level.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.600]   By the way, you don't have to have wires.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.880]   You can glue this anywhere.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.280]   I was thinking of putting it on our bedroom door because it's battery as well.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.920]   So lithium ion battery lasts a--
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.240]   Yeah, you see what I'm saying?
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.680]   You know what I'm talking about here?
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.480]   Last year.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.240]   Hey, who's out there?
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.280]   The thing is it not only rings your chimes in your house,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.800]   but it rings every device you install the ring software on.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.440]   And I put it on everything because I can never hear the doorbell ring.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.320]   So now when somebody rings our doorbell, I know because I hear it everywhere.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:36.960]   It's the chimes, right?
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.520]   On my laptop, on my iPhone, on my Android phone, on my tablets.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.240]   You dong, dong, dong.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.440]   It's very pleasant.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.040]   You can then fire up the app.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.880]   This is what's so interesting.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.720]   And you can see who's at the door.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.680]   There it is.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.120]   And you can see who's at the door.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.120]   And you could talk to them.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.760]   The other day a neighbor came by.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.920]   Let me see if I can find that one.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.160]   He came by, Bob the neighbor.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.600]   He wanted to chop down our trees.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.400]   It was a good thing that I actually answered the door.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:07.920]   I was at work.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.920]   Where is that camera?
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:10.640]   Holy cow.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.920]   That's right here.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.720]   OK.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.360]   Yeah, there he is.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.200]   There's Bob, Bob our neighbor.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.640]   Look at the wide field of view.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.640]   Yeah, that's good because you can see everybody is there.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.800]   And so I pressed the accept button and I talked to Bob.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.760]   There he is.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.880]   Oh, see, he's bringing wine.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.160]   This is his second visit.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.400]   So I said, hey, Bob.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.680]   He said, I want to come by and chop down your trees, you mind?
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.120]   I said, you know, Bob, I'm at work.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.400]   Can I call you later?
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.000]   But you can.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.800]   So that was an actual call that I took while I was at work.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.000]   In fact, some of you saw me do that.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.680]   It was right before the radio show.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.160]   So those are the missed calls or the answered calls.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.240]   But you can also get a call from just motion out front.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.720]   You can see if people are coming and going in front of your door.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.160]   So it's kind of like a security camera.
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.840]   And as you say, it's very wide.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.520]   So I can see what's going on.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.720]   That's actually our son leaving with his grandparents.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.200]   So I know exactly when that happened.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.880]   When my daughter comes in at two in the morning, I know.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   He left 1052 this morning.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.480]   Can I give you another use case Leo?
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:14.240]   When somebody sends my FedEx or UPS and they demand the signature,
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.000]   I want to be able to answer this with my mug on the screen and say to the guy,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.440]   really, I live here.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.400]   Leave the box.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.920]   I'll give you authorization.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.960]   Leave the box.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.000]   Leave the box.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.200]   Sometimes that works.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.000]   Can't promise.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.800]   But I tell you what, it certainly scares a burglar away.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.400]   Did you know 95% of home robberies occurred during the day?
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:38.800]   Burglar rings the doorbell before you, to see if your home, before he goes around back to break in.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.880]   If you, even if you're a work and you can answer the doorbell and say,
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.800]   hey, yeah, I'm giving the kids a bath.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.200]   Can I just leave it or?
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.720]   And then they run off.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.600]   So it's for safety.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.400]   It's for security.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.440]   It's for monitoring.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.200]   You said how there's some, the kids come into visit.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.240]   I just love this.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.520]   I just love this.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:58.320]   They can hear you.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.520]   You can hear them.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.560]   You can see them.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.880]   It's about 200 bucks, although we're going to give you $10 off if you go to ring.com/twig.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.600]   And notice you can have multiple doorbells on a single app.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.160]   So I can add another doorbell, like my bedroom doorbell.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:14.800]   That's the next one.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   Put it right on the door there.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.520]   What is it?
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.720]   Taking a bath right now.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.360]   Ring.com/twig.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.640]   It's easy to install.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.880]   I am not Mr. Handyman by any means.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.920]   I found it was simple.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.160]   And even if you don't have wiring, you can use it, which is great.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.400]   And it's really cool about this before you close out.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:34.640]   You have one?
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.040]   I do.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.600]   I love it.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.440]   I use it awesome 30 times.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.400]   I mean, I just love it.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.760]   I have the used to call it total information awareness in Pentagon.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.840]   It's so great to know what's going on.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.760]   And one of the things that's really cool is it's mounted on there really solidly.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.000]   Right.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.200]   If somebody somehow comes to the crowbar and pries it off your front,
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.480]   your wall, they'll replace it for free.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.440]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.160]   Yes.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:56.960]   So it's out there.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.000]   And it's just obviously a valuable piece of gadgetry.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.600]   It's not going to happen.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.800]   I think it's very unlikely.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.680]   But if you'll have video of them, if they do exactly,
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.600]   that's right up in the cloud.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.560]   So they don't steal that.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.000]   But they'll replace it for free.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.280]   That's it.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.040]   Jacob Baugham was showing me hers.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.360]   And she said, I will show you how this works, but I can't remember my password.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:17.680]   Oh.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.280]   Now you do need a password to log in.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.000]   And by the way, it's mounted on the door with a proprietary screw.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.880]   You get a proprietary bit, which deters somebody who wants to subtly steal it.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.040]   But I love it that they were replace it for free.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:33.840]   That's neat.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.080]   Ring.com/twig.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.200]   Obviously, there's nothing more.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.720]   No reason not to get this immediately.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.880]   French data regulator says,
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:50.640]   if you delete, if you delist somebody, if we agree and say you just
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.960]   delist somebody in France, Google, you have to delete it, not just on google.fr.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.880]   You have to delete it everywhere.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.760]   Not can't be appealed.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.320]   And if Google does the right thing and doesn't go along,
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.680]   what is it?
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.080]   I think it's two to five percent of Google's revenue.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.520]   Could be globally globally globally.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.760]   This is just this is exactly what I've been screaming about.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.200]   What's wrong with this decision?
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.200]   And if France can do it, so can China and so can Putin and and
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.760]   stay away from our internet people.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:25.600]   This bothers me profoundly on multiple levels, but one of them,
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.920]   and they're not admitting to this.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.320]   They literally say that contrary, this is a quote from the CNIL,
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.520]   which is the organization that rejected their appeal,
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.560]   said, quote, contrary to what Google has stated,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.640]   this decision does not show any willingness on the part of the CNIL
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.880]   to apply French law extra territorially.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.760]   No, we are not saying your law should be everywhere.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.040]   And so we're doing that's okay.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.040]   We're not saying that's our French law.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.640]   And that's that statement is a bald-faced lie.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.360]   We are sitting here in Peddleham, California,
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.880]   covered in the United States,
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.440]   protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.520]   Down the highway, an hour and 20 minutes away,
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.040]   is Google's headquarters.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.280]   They do they have a search index,
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.880]   in case you haven't heard about this,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.840]   where they index the internet and whatever's on the internet,
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.480]   if it's legal content, they try to index it.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.560]   So you can search for those things and find those items.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.600]   And what the French, this ruling does,
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.280]   is it reaches across the Atlantic,
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.680]   right past the Constitution,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.760]   and sensors internet in the United States for Americans.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.160]   This is like outrageous.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.840]   And I think Google needs to leave Europe.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.200]   This is this is and just just Europeans would just go to Google.com.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.080]   And what are they going to do?
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.200]   Block Google?
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:39.520]   Yes.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.040]   I don't think they will.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.240]   They don't I don't think they will block.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.120]   What do they do, Jeff?
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:47.040]   I mean, they can't say bullpucky and all fro say.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.480]   Yeah, I mean, it's just it's just they not do it.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.160]   Can they just ignore it?
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.720]   No, well, they'll be they'll be then they can.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.120]   Well, I want to sue France for damaging my Google search.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.800]   Yeah, there is no appeal.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.160]   Damage is exactly what it is.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.920]   They're they're requiring by law.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.760]   This is the right to be forgotten in general,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.320]   even in Europe.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:13.520]   The law says you must have a more inaccurate search engine
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   because of privacy.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.280]   And yes, privacy is important.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.000]   But what bugs me is this idea that the internet and content on the internet
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.360]   is something that can be metal with.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.160]   It can be censored.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.000]   You can do the equivalent of book burning as long as it's an American company doing something digitally.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   If they think that this content is so privacy evading,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.800]   then then go in there with with a bunch of of of jack booted thugs into the Guardian
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.680]   and shut them down.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.120]   Sensor the content itself if this is sensible content, but if it's legal content,
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   then the search engines should point to it.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.400]   It's speech.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.840]   It is pure and simple to speech.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   We believe in free speech in this country.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.160]   And unfortunately, others don't hold that same sacred right as we do.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.000]   But but now they are indeed.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.440]   This is that's why I said was always going to happen is that European standards were going to
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.920]   we're going to affect us in the US and the rest of the world.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.360]   And then you're going to end up with the lowest common denominator because now you know damn well
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.600]   that putty put is asking the same thing.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.040]   Yeah, yeah, the denominator is going to get way lower here.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:15.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.320]   Exactly.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:16.800]   And this is.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:23.120]   The only I can see happening now and Google God bless him has not done a great job of dealing
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.560]   with this thing, ignored it for a while.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.880]   It came on the most surprise.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:31.120]   I think I said on the show I was I was at a Google privacy event to speak.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.680]   Now, if you were this decision was handed out and they were all gobs back.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.560]   They didn't see it coming.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.240]   And Europeans say, you should have hello.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.440]   And the only thing I can know is that Google has to put forward Google and others in the
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.840]   Russia Silicon Valley and our government have to put forward a full frontal assault on the
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.080]   stupidity of this, including PR.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.680]   But also I think at some level, I wonder what the right is to go to the human rights court
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   and go to the EU as a whole.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.600]   Because the EU will come down in some cases on such a debate.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.840]   The problem with this of course is right to be forgotten.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   Is it a court decision with no right of appeal?
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.840]   And so it is royally effed up.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.680]   But Google has to find a way to fight this.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.280]   And I don't know legally what the options are.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.240]   As Matthew says, it is unappealable at that level.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.160]   Once they're fined, then they can go fight that.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.960]   But then they've already been found basically guilty of something they've already been
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.760]   fined.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.480]   And they've got a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.920]   I don't know.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:34.400]   The only thing I could see is the EU might
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.120]   decide, yes, they have made decisions about the right to be forgotten.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:45.280]   But they might be open to an appeal on the basis that France is trying to effectively apply its
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.880]   laws extra territorially, which is a no-no.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.360]   So I mean, that might be an avenue of appeal.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.720]   I don't know if the EU would listen.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.680]   But I just, I mean, look, don't we want privacy?
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.280]   Isn't this what we've been fighting for?
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.560]   This kind of, I think this is absolutely right.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.760]   We want privacy.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.280]   We've been saying this all along.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.160]   We don't want these companies to store information about us.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.600]   I think this is completely legitimate.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.080]   You know, they're doing the right thing.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.760]   We like privacy.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.720]   Privacy is a core value in the West.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.480]   So does France affect Europe?
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.680]   Europe protects their people better than the United States does.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.600]   Well, that's a European value.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:26.880]   And if European values are going to be instituted, not in the publications that exist in Europe,
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.600]   but in the search engines that exist in Mountain View,
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.480]   then the Saudi Arabian values have to be applied globally.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.640]   The Chinese values, no more mentioning or photographing the Dalai Lama.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.800]   No women's hair can be exposed on Google because Saudi Arabia doesn't like it.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.280]   If Saudi Arabia executes a blogger, they don't really want to have problems
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.160]   with their relationship with the United States, their big oil customer.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.120]   And they want to censor that.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.320]   That's a Saudi Arabian value.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.480]   And that has to be implemented into Google.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.400]   You can't mention that anything about that blogger being executed
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.680]   because Saudi Arabia's values insist that that be a global.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:06.800]   This is its redo its and by the way, this for Europe, this is cultural bigotry to think
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.560]   they actually expect Google to say, okay, European values are good.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.720]   Everybody else's values are bad.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   But to play Leo's devil's advocate role here, which Leo does very well,
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.360]   they would argue that we have forced our values on the world.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:21.680]   Right.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:21.920]   Right.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.720]   In fact, you are.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.440]   Right.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:30.400]   You Americans, you don't mind if you put your your your public your private stuff in public,
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.680]   but we do not wish this and we wish that right to be forgotten.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.880]   That's it's exactly.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.560]   We would like to forget you, France.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.520]   Please let us know.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.160]   Can Google stop doing business in countries like China?
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.280]   They did this China.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.320]   Oh, yeah, there is.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.600]   There is a simple solution.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:49.280]   All Google has to do is serve people in France, Google.FR and remove whatever.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.040]   No, I think they I think for legal reasons, they'd have to block France
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.760]   because you can't be doing business in France.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.920]   Otherwise, you're you're prone to this.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.280]   But see, they wouldn't block France.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:04.080]   See, they don't they don't actually think they're censoring, even though they are literally censoring.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:09.760]   Well, that's why Google says if we get a query from a French block of IP addresses, we say, I'm sorry.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.240]   You'll have to use whatever the crappy piece of software you guys have.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.560]   Yeah, but back to this institute imposing American values on Europe.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:23.280]   No, this content that that is being that the links to which is being blocked
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:31.680]   are legal articles are legal articles on the by French law, the French the French publications,
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:39.120]   for example, those are it's in French and there's a French journalists expressing the French value
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.160]   of freedom of speech in printing these articles.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.320]   And then it's so it's not like it's not like we're imposing a pedophilia on them.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.000]   No, I understand, but they have a court.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.280]   They have a system.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.680]   The court has decided respect their court.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.600]   We respect the Supreme Court, right?
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.000]   We'd expect to I mean, just move out.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.040]   Exactly. They have to leave Europe that this is this is just completely honest.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.440]   I don't what else you could do. They're not going to do that, but I think they might actually.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.520]   Wouldn't that be great just to say, hey, sorry, you're coming in from France.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.920]   We certainly know how to do geographic restrictions.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.360]   By the way, there'd be a risk business in VPNs. Yes, in France.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.120]   And that's how it should work.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.480]   That's how it should work.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.920]   Wow. Wow.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.960]   That's all I can say. And by yes, of course, I was being a devil's advocate.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.760]   Thank you for noticing.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.080]   Yes.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.240]   I know.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.880]   But I do. But I there was a kernel of truth in that because I I really worry and you
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.560]   I know you agree with me on this, Jeff, that we are so concerned about
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.440]   and I feel like this is kind of in reaction a knee jerk reaction, a Snowden.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:44.080]   So concerned about our privacy that we will in fact start shutting down valuable,
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.000]   you know, technology technological advances.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.120]   Things like we love you and I love the Amazon echo, Mike, but people are so but it's listening
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:58.560]   in your house and I could easily see stuff like that not develop being developed, not happening
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   because people are so concerned about privacy.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:07.280]   So there is a point of truth in that when I said that because I do think that many people point
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.600]   to the EU as an exemplar in privacy regulation, first, you know,
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.120]   I'll sign her former head of consumer protection in Germany, some different title.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:23.440]   Yeah, I said this on the show before when four years ago said that the use of
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.160]   geotechnology and facial recognition together was henceforth and forever.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:28.560]   Fair boat.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.240]   Taboo was the word.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.760]   Well, and as I've always said, you could find missing children and Alzheimer's patients
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.360]   of all kinds of other things when you regulate a technology because you fear what the technology
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.040]   could do when you regulate speech because when you fear the speech could do
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:49.120]   you're basically insulting the public, the future, your kind of possible.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.360]   But we live in a place with the country of the First Amendment.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.040]   There are very few countries that have free speech in that regard in the way we have.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.160]   That's absolutely right.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:56.720]   Exactly.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.720]   Did not Google as El Khaleef has pointed out in her chair, opened the door to this by
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.480]   voluntarily censoring search results on things like torrents and they were forced to.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.240]   Well, it wasn't voluntary.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.520]   But again, Google has a perfect right to decide itself what to do.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.840]   Google can decide not to put child porn out and Google decides that and that's
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.480]   what Google's fine.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:18.640]   Right.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:18.960]   Okay.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.080]   That's the distinction.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.040]   But Google nipples up.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.160]   But this is the distinction.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.000]   I don't agree with that, but they do it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.160]   Right.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:29.440]   But there's a huge distinction to be made between linking to illegal content,
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.040]   whether it's swastikas in Germany, whether it's child porn, just about anywhere,
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.240]   and legal content. Yes. The problem is that it's really easy to find content on the internet.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.440]   That is a problem.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.240]   That it's a problem that sometimes people can be stigmatized by things that happened
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.360]   that are it's no longer fair for them to be stigmatized for those things.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.560]   That's what this is all about.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.000]   One example is there was a guy who was when he was young, he was a hippie,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.040]   who had a beard, long hair, and he was playing this goofy Australian instrument in a public park.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.320]   And the local newspaper took a picture of him and put it up online.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.760]   This is like 15 years ago.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.880]   Now it's in their archive.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.560]   Now he's a financial consultant.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.440]   He's got a suit and tie, a three-piece suit, and he wants to be respectable.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.640]   And he felt that the hippie picture was ostracized, was stigmatizing.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   And he asked that it be removed, and under the law of the right to be forgotten, it was removed.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.080]   It's unfortunate that content like that is easy to find, and it's stigmatizing.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.520]   However, the article, well, in this case, this is a bad example,
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.560]   because in fact, the newspaper voluntarily removed the article itself.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.840]   But normally that's not the case.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:37.760]   But the problem is that that's an unfortunate reality that that sort of thing happens.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:43.680]   The right to be forgotten is equivalent to being you can't burn books unless they're best
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.200]   sellers, in which case they're everywhere, and therefore it's okay to burn best sellers.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.120]   You just can't burn obscure books.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.520]   Like nobody would pass a law like that, but that's exactly what the right to be forgotten is.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:00.000]   The Europeans do not take the internet seriously as a protected medium of content.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.400]   That's why they don't mind burning the internet.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.520]   They would never bring the books.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.080]   I had the same argument when there was a TV critic,
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:12.240]   when there was efforts, the V-ship put in VCRs, so the television kind of hit could be censored.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.600]   We never would have allowed that with books, because we respect books.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.120]   We didn't respect television.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:17.600]   You're right.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.440]   The internet is not respected at all.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.480]   It's demonized, and they've got to see that the internet is speech.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:27.200]   And folks, if we're not going to fight, who the hell is going to fight?
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:39.040]   How does somebody, does Boing Boing or EFF get people together to go march on the Elize Palace?
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.840]   I don't know what we do, but if we don't fight, nobody's going to fight, and it's just going to happen to us.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.120]   It's really simple.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.440]   The good news is, the good news is, France is a small country, probably not a huge amount of money.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:57.360]   Now's that this is like Neville Chamberlain and the Nazis.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.720]   Godwin's law, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.160]   I point that out.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:00.800]   Congratulations.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.720]   Now fulfill Godwin's law.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.160]   You cannot appease.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.160]   You cannot appease the French.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.560]   This is the time to send a signal to the EU and to every other country that would do this.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.040]   You can afford to do it in France, right?
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.000]   Maybe you couldn't afford to do it in China, but you can afford to do it in France.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.960]   Cut them off now.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.480]   Send a signal.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.760]   You don't like what we do.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.440]   We will cut you off and then see how many times that happens in the future.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.840]   I think the French would love it for Google to be France, because there is a smattering
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.080]   of French search engines and they would love to get them a chance.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.440]   Hey, we're back to Minitel.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.120]   I bet they'd love to bring back the Minitel.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:43.120]   One aspect of this is the sort of European cultural resistance to
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.200]   giant US corporations.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.800]   Coconut journalism, I think they call it.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.320]   Yeah, we've talked about this before.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.160]   Yeah, and I was in Italy talking to people about Google and about Facebook.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:58.800]   One of the big sorts of resistances is just these are giant US companies
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.840]   coming over here and they own the internet and they tell us what to do and they take all our
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.800]   advertising and all our news and all our industries are going under.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.200]   And so a lot of it is just anti-Googleism.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.600]   I'm sorry to interrupt, Matthew.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.200]   I'm so sorry, but it's like this is the irony that they don't understand.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.320]   The reason that these companies are all American is because American government
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.840]   didn't preemptively ban things and didn't do insane things like the right to be forgotten.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:31.200]   If that were the case and if Europe had more of a Wild West type of situation,
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.760]   we'd be complaining about the French search engine with its dominant cultural values
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.120]   and being imposed on it.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.640]   I happen to like the French culture.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:43.040]   I look forward to going back to France next year as I do as many years as I can.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.200]   I love the people, the food.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.360]   Maybe not so happy about the CNIL.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.560]   But nevertheless, I think this is the way you handle it.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.760]   And you don't.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.480]   What you've got to do is you've got to act and you've got to act
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.480]   briskly to forest all.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.600]   What would the stock market do?
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.640]   But the other one will mark it.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.760]   Oh, who cares?
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:01.840]   Google said.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.120]   The stock market doesn't...
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.720]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.840]   Maybe I'm stupid.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.640]   Does your stock price really impact how you run the company?
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.000]   It's not your money anymore.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.760]   You already got your big chunk of change from the IPO.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.440]   Who cares what your stock price is?
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.320]   The market will say, "Uh-oh, if France did this, where else is going to say Google?"
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.120]   Let's get rid of Google.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:21.920]   Now we know how.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.880]   No, but nobody wants to get rid of Google.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.560]   Well, okay.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.680]   All institutions.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.040]   All institutions do.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.320]   But the people don't and the people will win.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.400]   Imagine, I mean, look, you don't want to screw with the French people.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.640]   Back to the barricades, baby.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.240]   Burned up.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:40.960]   Cut your head off.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.480]   Cut your head off.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.600]   Get in there.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.720]   Also burned down McDonald's.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.000]   The burned down McDonald's.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.280]   But it is a good point.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:54.880]   92% north of 92% of the search engine using public in France is loving Google.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.240]   That's way higher than the US.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.760]   They're way more popular in France than France.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:04.320]   So Google puts a big page that says, "Domaj, no Google for you today.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.720]   You better believe you'd hear it."
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.560]   And that law, it would be completely transformed.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.840]   No, he's caught in Spain.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.920]   Especially when you put in Spain with the publishers.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.200]   Especially if you put a photo of it.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.840]   It was about Falk Perotene who's in charge of this organization that--
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.880]   He'd be stoned.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   Yeah, you know that French love McDonald's too.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.360]   Do you know that?
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.800]   They really do.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.080]   I was in a-- when we were in Budapest, several times,
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:34.720]   guides pointed out the first McDonald's in the Eastern block.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.520]   There it is.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.080]   There were lines around the block for months.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.160]   People would die to get their hands on a big Mac.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.400]   People would get dressed up to go wait in line.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   It would be-- one of our guys told us that.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.760]   He said, "You want the best date.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.360]   You want to get a girl to love you in those days."
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.840]   This was probably '80s, '70s.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.600]   It was of course still a part of the Warsaw Pact.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.800]   It was still a communist block country.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.360]   You take her to McDonald's, man.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.720]   She would flip her lid.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.320]   So surprised.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.480]   And when they opened in Moscow, the McDonald's,
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.280]   I've read stories about this.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.520]   McDonald's biggest challenge was trying to get--
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.000]   This was during the Soviet Union.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.840]   Trying to get Russian--
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.320]   the Russian cashiers and so on to smile and give friendly--
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.320]   to be friendly because it's so counter to the Soviet culture.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.120]   What do you want?
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.680]   Get in here.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.360]   I give you meat.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.920]   Meat and pie.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:26.880]   No soup.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.680]   I give you roasted potato.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.280]   What do you think?
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.080]   You liked it?
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:32.560]   It's good.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.640]   It's funny, really.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.600]   They couldn't--
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.200]   Like, they culturally wouldn't smile.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.960]   They just couldn't bring themselves to it.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.960]   No, there's nothing to be happy about.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.880]   Have you not seen what's going on out there?
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.080]   It's terrible.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.440]   World sucks.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.560]   Would you like flies with it?
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:56.560]   Ah, Ahmed Mohammed is at Google right now.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.720]   Oh, he's right with the other right now.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.680]   He's there right now.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.760]   Is this-- is it OK?
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.840]   Look, I am--
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.400]   I'm all for this kid and he's a maker.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.000]   I understand he didn't invent the clock.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.360]   He didn't make it bit by bit.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.880]   He took apart a clock.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.600]   He got it radio.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.240]   That's fine.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:14.880]   This is a maker.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.760]   That's how you start.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.400]   I think what the school did to him was reprehensible.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.080]   I think there's probably very good evidence.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.000]   It was racist and he Muslim.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.360]   Muslim.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.960]   But I got some email about this though.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.360]   No, I know because there's now a backlash.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.480]   But maybe we are going a little too far honoring this kid.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.800]   He's just received like every kind of Microsoft product known to man.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.360]   That's America's celebrity.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.160]   He's been offered--
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:36.560]   Yeah, it is.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.000]   He's been offered a trip to the White House.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:38.880]   I think he's going.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.680]   He's been offered a job at Facebook internship.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.600]   And now he's at the Google Science Fair
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.440]   hanging out with no lesser light than Sergey Brin.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.280]   All you got to do is take apart a clock and man.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.480]   It's-- everybody feels super guilty about how badly Muslims are treated in the US.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:56.960]   Wow.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.440]   Especially in places like Irving, Texas.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.800]   You nailed it though.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.360]   I mean, of course it happened to the kid was terrible and everything.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.040]   But this is celebrity in the US.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:08.400]   And then inevitably it goes completely the up.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:08.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.440]   Direction.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.440]   He's going to-- yeah, we're going to receive the stories.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.280]   You put the clock now.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.560]   In two years we're going to see the story.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.320]   Poor Ahmed was at the center of the universe and then everybody dumped them.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.480]   And he wondered what the heck happened.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.040]   You know what?
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.000]   That's a good point.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.120]   Yeah, you're back to geometry class.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.480]   He thinks his life is made.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.600]   This could be the worst thing that happened.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.480]   Yeah, right.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:26.640]   Right.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   Right.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.240]   He's going to wake up with the better.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:28.640]   So when I was at the E.C.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.080]   The governor in San Francisco, with Skylab fell,
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.680]   remember that?
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.240]   Old folks.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.280]   Yep.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.000]   We gave-- we offered-- and I had called NASA.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.200]   And they said this is--
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.640]   they were going to fall over land.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.360]   Don't worry about it.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.320]   No money involved.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.560]   We offered $10,000 as a prize to really block the E.C. Skylab to our office.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:46.960]   Wow.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.600]   And a year-- because we found out that the Chronicle was going to offer insurance
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.040]   to Chronicle subscribers if they got injured by Skylab.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:55.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.520]   So we said that was awfully negative.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.960]   So we'll offer money for Skylab.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.600]   And it was good old time newspaper war.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.160]   And so this kid named Stan Thornton from Esperance, Western Australia,
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.600]   a beer truck assistant by God with the help of an Australian radio station,
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.000]   caved his ever-sister with pieces of Skylab.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.560]   And I remember it was-- so Stan was 70 years old.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.120]   He wanted money.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.480]   Because of the amount of sitting here.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.000]   Well, the demand as an editor basically adopted him for three weeks.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.760]   Because we couldn't let him be on his own.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.080]   So we--
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.280]   Oh, I was--
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.480]   We'll never know what happened.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:28.960]   Yep.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:30.720]   You wasn't--
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.160]   When all the fame left?
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:32.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.600]   You froze.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.080]   Start--
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:34.560]   Finish that.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.200]   The last sentence again, please.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.400]   So he adopted him.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.360]   Yeah, adopted him.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:39.840]   So he adopted him.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.280]   And then he couldn't stand.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.760]   When the fame left, you know what to do.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.440]   He was-- he was-- you know, well, what?
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.640]   You loved Don't Love Me anymore?
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.320]   It was kind of sad.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   What is the movie where the guy-- he's a poor drunken son now.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.880]   He was the quiz kid who won all that money.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.160]   Oh, that was Magnolia.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:58.720]   Magnolia.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:11:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.840]   He was Donnie, quiz kid.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.600]   He had Barnes or whatever.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:04.960]   What was his name?
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.400]   That was hilarious.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.440]   Such-- by the way.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.560]   William H. Macy.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.520]   William H. Macy.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.000]   Great.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.440]   One of the best movies ever made.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.360]   And he was trying to get braces because he--
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.160]   Right.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.320]   He was in love with the bartender who had braces.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:16.960]   Right.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.440]   Oh my god.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.000]   What a great move.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.080]   That's right up there with Pulp Fiction Magnolia.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:22.320]   Wow.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:22.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.280]   I never saw that.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:23.760]   Millions.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.880]   You-- what?
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.840]   Oh, you got to watch.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.880]   On the plate of the way back.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.440]   I'll be watching it.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.840]   Actually, one of Tom Cruise's finest roles.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.400]   You know what?
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.480]   That turned me around on Tom Cruise.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.760]   It does an amazing job.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.480]   I thought, my god, he can act.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.640]   Only there, though.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   Actually, he's re-preased that role several times,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.440]   including in "Rock of Ages."
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.600]   He's very good at that kind of crazed.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.520]   Paul Thomas Anderson, who is one of the--
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.800]   One of our great directors.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   And this is a must-see movie.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.160]   He's giving an interview to remember to that woman.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.560]   And he just stops.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.520]   He just stares at it.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.560]   What are you doing?
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.480]   He says, I'm silently judging you.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.760]   Ah.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.760]   Let's take a break.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.040]   You can all watch the movie later.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.280]   Don't watch it now.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.720]   Just put it on your wish list.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.720]   That's a wonderfully weird show this week.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.480]   It's fun.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.040]   You know why?
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.680]   It's the perfect recipe.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.160]   I've really realized this was shows.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.200]   And we spent a lot of time thinking
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.880]   about who should be on the show.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.280]   Three Americans in a Canadian.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.360]   Now--
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360]   East and 11.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.840]   It's personalities.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.440]   You get the right personalities together,
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.360]   and something magic happens.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.120]   And I just really don't know how that happens, right?
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.760]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.480]   Anyway, I'm thrilled to have you all, Matt Ingram,
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.560]   Matthew Ingram from Forchard.com.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.240]   Are you back from the lake?
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.200]   I am, unfortunately.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:47.720]   Oh, man.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.240]   Those pictures all summer long.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.440]   [GASP]
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.880]   Man.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:56.640]   Follow him on Instagram if you know what a--
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.320]   it was like--
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:58.680]   He went--
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:58.680]   He went--
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.200]   He went in movies.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.920]   It was like the loans, Norman, the loans.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.400]   He went straight from the canals of Venice to this--
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.120]   That's right.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.000]   The kayak photos are over for this year.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.440]   No more kayak photos.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:08.800]   Damn.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.120]   Until next summer.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:10.840]   Damn.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.320]   What was that?
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.920]   On Golden Pond.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.400]   And actually, you know, I ran into a guy in London,
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.920]   and he said, you know, I like you,
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.000]   and you're writing and everything.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.440]   But you know what I really like?
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.760]   I like your photos of like canoes and kayaks.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.160]   Because I told my son that everybody in Canada
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.800]   has a cabin up in the woods.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.480]   They all go kayaking and canoeing.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.040]   So nice.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.680]   Jeff Jarvis, who is in Los Angeles for ONA,
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.000]   the Online News Association.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:36.840]   Are you speaking tonight?
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.120]   What are you speaking?
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.160]   Not speaking.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.640]   You're just standing there?
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.160]   Why?
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.120]   You're going to rock deep.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.560]   You're going to pull a Google?
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.400]   Terrorist.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.960]   Talk to the hand.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.680]   That's what Google needs a big hand.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.320]   Talk to the hand.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.800]   And Mike Gallegon is here all the time,
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.400]   but it's so good to have him sitting here talking about the Google.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.520]   There's nobody more fun to talk about Google wouldn't Mike.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.600]   Some day--
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.760]   Yeah, I love this show too.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.600]   This is my favorite show.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.800]   I end my week with this show, and I love doing that.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.560]   Someday we'll talk about Mike's project.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.520]   He's making "Cammam Bear."
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.200]   Yes.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.000]   And I saw an "Bree" and "Bree."
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.520]   That's on your Instagram, right?
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.680]   I think my wife is posting on Instagram.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.280]   And you're--
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.520]   You know what I want you to make.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.960]   I want you to make a paw paw pie.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.800]   We discussed that last week.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.520]   We love paw paws.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.320]   And I found out somebody emailed me that Luther Burbank Gardens up here
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.960]   in Santa Rosa has two, not one but two.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.000]   You need two paw paw trees.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.280]   They cross-pawning like avocado, so you have to have a male and a female.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.480]   Oh, sounds very sorted.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.120]   But there's paw paw.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:41.640]   Paw paw.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.560]   The paw paw tree.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.560]   I could go pluck a paw paw just minutes away.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.920]   I might do that.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.640]   Mike is-- not only are you making--
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.840]   tell us the story.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.200]   Because you're making this-- you're not just making cheese.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.280]   You're making cheese.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:57.800]   Making cheese.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.080]   OK, so we try to do things from scratch, my wife and I.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.760]   And we keep stepping-- we keep pulling the thread out of the sweater.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.600]   So we got into a gallon and a half of milk every day.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.120]   So my wife--
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.440]   Milk and cow next door.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.480]   Yeah, next door.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.720]   And so it's too much milk for the family that owns a cow.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.120]   So we alternate every other day.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:16.480]   So my wife--
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.120]   So Amira milks it.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:18.920]   She milks it.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.680]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.440]   She milks the cow.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:26.520]   She goes out and leads the cow from its fantastic pasture
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.960]   into the milking barn.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.080]   And with this--
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.960]   Does she have a machine or she do it by hand?
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:31.920]   There's a machine here.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.440]   Oh, that's true.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.200]   It's a thing.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.960]   And it takes like 20 minutes or something like that.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.360]   And then gallon and a half every other day.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.000]   And then every other day, I eat lunch.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.080]   And so we got a cheese cave.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.040]   It's a wine fridge.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.520]   She's making butter.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.280]   Cheese--
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.200]   Yeah, but wait, there's more.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.440]   So I'm making Camabere and Brie and some other things.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:50.360]   I'm going to make some blue cheese.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.480]   I started cultivating my own mold for blue cheese.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.560]   Yes, I've been watching that with interest.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.080]   But now--
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.440]   It's right there on the TNT desk.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.560]   I used to do a lot of that in my kitchen.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.240]   It's like a company refrigerator.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.760]   Yeah, not deliberately.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.480]   So the latest one is that you--
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.760]   Rennet can be made from a variety of things.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.920]   But traditionally, it's made from one of the stomachs
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.840]   of a ruminant of some kind.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.520]   So we acquired a ruminant, a sheep, and we had it slaughtered.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.000]   And this happened--
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:16.960]   Oh, no.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.560]   They're going to look the whole thing.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.280]   They didn't just do it for the guys.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.120]   You didn't slaughter it?
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:21.800]   You didn't slaughter it?
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.440]   I didn't slaughter it personally.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.560]   But there's a truck that--
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.320]   This is Petaloma.
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.400]   We're in a farm community.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.520]   There's a truck that goes around and says,
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.440]   sheep-- anybody got sheep will slaughter it for you?
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.240]   House calls.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:31.760]   They make house calls.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.760]   You don't slaughter it yourself.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.040]   What was a slaughter truck?
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:34.880]   What's funny is my--
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   You're not as much of a man as Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.960]   He kills it for food.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.480]   Yeah, I wonder if he still does that.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.160]   But anyway, so it was funny as my wife texted me.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.480]   It was outside that they came and it started to happen.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.080]   She's like, come on here right away.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.040]   You need to describe which of the stomachs you need.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040]   And so I went and told him--
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.240]   Which of the stomachs?
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.360]   Yeah, the four stomachs.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.560]   Do you know which of the stomachs?
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.960]   I was quickly flipping through there like--
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   Google told me to say, hey Siri, which of the four stomachs
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:00.600]   makes rennet?
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.680]   Of the ruminant.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.680]   This is a good test.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.320]   OK, Google, which of the four stomachs of a ruminant
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.480]   is needed in rennet?
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.160]   I said it's used for rennet, right?
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.760]   Oh, I see it got renton.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.760]   But it did come up with this--
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.160]   what is a ruminant?
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.920]   It's a hand, an article on the ruminant digestive system.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.000]   That's a very interesting topic.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.760]   Anyway, so I go out there and I told him,
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.400]   and he carves it out and he just hands it to me.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.520]   So I'm like with this stomach thing.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.320]   What do you do with that?
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:31.920]   What you do--
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.680]   Mince it?
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.520]   What you do is you cover it in salt,
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:39.680]   and you let it go because rennet is a series of enzymes.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.120]   And you're cultivating and growing these enzymes.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.680]   So you pack it in salt, and you leave it sitting there
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.720]   for six months.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.160]   No, the enzymes are not--
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:48.800]   They're inside.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.440]   They're not like living organisms.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.320]   They're chemicals.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.160]   Right, exactly.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.680]   And--
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.400]   Right, OK.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.800]   And they live in a community, but there's one of them
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.000]   that quagulates--
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:58.800]   I don't know if they live.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.360]   They don't live in a community.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.240]   They're like to see how it would like to live in a community
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:02.800]   of M&M's.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.760]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.000]   Anyway, so in six months, they'll have--
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.160]   This is topics on Twitter.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.440]   Now, is a rennet kind of like a sourdough starter?
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.520]   You just take a little bit and you keep it going?
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.320]   No, it uses it up.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.240]   It's the main good at it.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.280]   So there'll be--
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.960]   There'll be further slaughter in the future.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.120]   But I mean, I imagine it'll last a long time.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.160]   You don't need a lot of rennet.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.880]   No, just a time a little bit.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.840]   How did somebody figure out that only a piece from a stomach--
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.680]   one of the specific stomachs--
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.680]   Where did I actually--
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.520]   What else are they going to do?
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.520]   I used to make cheese.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.600]   I've been solid to you for a year.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.600]   I did.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.320]   First of all, it's a myth that you need rennet to make cheese.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.880]   Cheese will make itself use raw milk.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.240]   And with nothing.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.920]   Or if you had any acid--
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.720]   It has rennet to feed it up.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.000]   For certain types of aged cheeses, you need rennet.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.080]   But for like regular cheese.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.920]   So the way to discover this is that oftentimes when
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.760]   you slaughter one of these animals,
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   there's actually cheese in there.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]   Like if you--
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.280]   Oh, no.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.120]   That's not cheese.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.400]   We talk-- no, no.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   In France--
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.920]   In back to the French, in France,
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.800]   it's actually a very expensive valued type of cheese
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.720]   that's sort of made by the--
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.680]   I mean, that's essential.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.040]   And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why we will not allow
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:15.120]   the French to export unpasteurized cheese to the existence.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.120]   I think we should.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.120]   Or--
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.120]   Bear laws.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.400]   I disagree with the French on the right to be forgotten,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.000]   but they really know how to do cheese, man.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.320]   Well, there's an example.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.240]   There's an example.
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.240]   There's an example.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.280]   We do not get the best French cheese in the United States
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.120]   because our laws prevent it.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:29.880]   Are those prepressed?
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.720]   Is it the same in Canada?
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.280]   No, you must-- they must allow good French cheese.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:32.800]   No, it is.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.960]   No, in fact, there's a quite a well-known farmer who
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.480]   was selling unpasteurized milk.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.960]   And he basically shot him down.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.040]   And this is driven by the dairy industry
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:48.480]   because if you-- in order to do raw milk,
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.800]   it has to be a small--
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.920]   it's as if the Schlitz and Budweiser companies
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.360]   banned the making of microbrews.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.920]   Because raw milk has to be done on a very small scale.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.420]   Right.
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.280]   Yeah, for obvious reasons.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.720]   So it's a political thing.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.280]   And people have bought a good one.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.400]   Talk about the Leo-Margar in Act of 1952 or whatever it was.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.000]   Did it prohibit it or did it promote it?
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.880]   It actually required margarine can not
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.280]   be sold that looked like butter.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.040]   Oh, that's right.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.520]   At one point, I think it was in Wisconsin.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.120]   If you went into a restaurant, they were not
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.240]   allowed to offer you margarine.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.240]   You could have it if you requested it.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.920]   They were not legally allowed to offer it.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.040]   It's like here in California, they
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.040]   can't offer you water at the restaurant anymore.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.280]   It's illegal to say, would you like water?
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.040]   If you ask for it, they'll give it to you.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.400]   The law prohibits them because we're in a drought.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.200]   You know what?
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.320]   I remember-- I don't remember.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.640]   My parents tell me during the war
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.000]   when you ate a lot of Oleo because butter was a precious commodity.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:46.520]   It would come.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.960]   It would be white and you would get a coloring packet.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.040]   Yeah, you got it.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.320]   You'd push it together.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:52.880]   Wow.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.480]   And now we know that that healthy thing called margarine
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.200]   is actually the worst thing you could possibly eat.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:21:59.920]   It's just--
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920]   Chunk a trans fat.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.880]   He said they went across the border to buy illegal margarine.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:09.800]   It's like hooch.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.720]   You know, it's my go to the car.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.240]   All right, all right, all right.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:13.680]   By the way--
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.880]   It's working to you.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.120]   Thanks to the French Constitution,
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.360]   you have the right to forget the conversation you've just heard.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.200]   And I urge you to use your rights.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.160]   I'll show you.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.760]   This all started as a Linda ad.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.080]   But you see, the point being, we love to learn new stuff, right?
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.000]   We do.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.960]   The human brain is made to learn.
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.480]   And if you stop learning, you stop living.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.480]   You've got to expand.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.080]   And there may be good reason for it--
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.400]   for other reasons, you might make you a better employee.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.200]   You might get a raise.
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.920]   You might be able to get a better job.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:48.680]   Linda.com is the place to go if you
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:53.640]   would like to make things happen, if you would like to learn.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.840]   For your work or for your hobby, maybe
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.520]   you want to learn how to code, make an app.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.960]   Maybe you want to get a website.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.600]   You need to learn how to design it.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.120]   Master Excel, sharpen your business skills.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.440]   I'm a photo buff.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.360]   I'm like crazy.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.520]   And of course, I've taken some of the best courses
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.760]   on photography at Linda.com.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.360]   First of all, you got Bert Monroe, the best Photoshop guru
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.960]   in the world teaching there.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.800]   In fact, all the teachers are great.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.160]   Many of them are friends of mine.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.680]   People like that guy right there, Ben Long, who's awesome.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.000]   His course on learning to be a better photographer
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.880]   is one of the best ways to learn photography.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.520]   He's just great.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.240]   They've got introduction of photography,
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.800]   getting started with a photography.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.520]   I love this one.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.000]   There's the five-day photo challenge.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.320]   This will help you improve your composition skills.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   There are new courses on color correction
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.800]   and making selective adjustments in Adobe Camera Raw.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.600]   You know what?
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.000]   Master curves.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.080]   It's very, very good.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.520]   The fundamental of Photoshop's for the brand new one,
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.080]   Creative Cloud 2015.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.320]   I could just tell you, the stuff at Linda.com
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:54.960]   is fantastic.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.360]   3,888 courses last time I checked.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.960]   In almost every subject, business, technology,
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.480]   creative skills, soft business skills too,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.040]   like negotiating a raise or making a resume.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.160]   There's some great stuff in there running a business.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.320]   I'm going to look into that negotiating a raise one.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:12.920]   Shut up.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.760]   That sounds great.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.680]   That's one that we block all our employees from seeing.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.520]   Dang it.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.080]   If only we could.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.960]   Actually, a lot of businesses do have
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.440]   Linda.com accounts for their employees.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.800]   It's a great way to keep your employees sharp.
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.640]   I want you to visit Linda.com and find out more.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.600]   Here's what you're going to get at a free 10-day trial.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:38.000]   Lindalynda.com/twig.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:38.880]   10 days free.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.120]   That's enough to do a couple of courses beginning to end
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.600]   or just to dip your toe into a bunch of them.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.160]   Where are we going to put this astronaut?
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.280]   We're cutting him out of the moon.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.440]   I'm going to put him somewhere else.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.440]   This is fun.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.400]   If you want to find out, Linda.com/twig
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.680]   and get that free 10-day trial.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.160]   That's the Content-Aware Move Scale and Rotate section
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.120]   from Photoshop 2015.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.920]   Where do you think he's going to put that?
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.160]   It's so convincing I'm starting to doubt the moon landing.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.640]   That'd be a good course, wouldn't it?
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640]   How to fake your own moon landing.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.840]   They need a cheese course.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   How to make cheese.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.280]   Mike, I'll have to bring you cheese.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.080]   I think Mike could teach that course.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:19.080]   I learned a lot about cheese just in this show.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:19.880]   Oh, man.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.640]   Mike got me.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:26.440]   I have-- I've got so many utensils on my counter now.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.040]   For all kinds of things.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.560]   You know what Jenny Jardin got me, the tortilla making.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.640]   I now have a 25-pound bag of corn.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.040]   We make tortillas, too.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.040]   You know what we're doing?
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.520]   We're fermenting the tortillas now.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.720]   So it's better.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:42.720]   It's better.
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.720]   So I have to give me that.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.720]   I got the press.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720]   I got the lime.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720]   I got the corn.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.720]   Why would you ferment them?
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.720]   They just taste a little better.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.720]   Everything's better for me.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.360]   So the theory is that in the old days where tortillas were
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.800]   cultivated in the Mayan era and so on, of course, they
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.440]   didn't have refrigerators and they didn't have good storage,
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.720]   but they probably fermented it.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:07.520]   There's a fine line between going bad and tasting good.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.400]   But the great thing about fermented foods is you can
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.720]   always tell when it's gone bad.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.840]   That's the great thing.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.400]   If it's delicious, it's good for you.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.200]   But once you're in Iceland, then you have shark.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:16.720]   Right.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.360]   Did it shark--
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.080]   Never, never do that.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.320]   What, really?
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.400]   Never eat that.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.080]   Don't eat fermented shark?
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:22.600]   No.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.440]   Why?
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.960]   Have you tried that, you?
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.320]   Yeah, it's the worst.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.840]   There's another.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.440]   I don't want to offend the Icelandic community, but that
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.480]   is one of the worst meals ever.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   And the only thing close to it is called loot-fisk.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.720]   Oh, I've had loot-fisk.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.840]   Which is also disgusting.
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.880]   Japan also has a very challenging fermentation culture.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.800]   They have this stuff called natto, which is like--
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:52.120]   it's a fermented grain, but it is really something special.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.280]   Really, every culture has fermented something.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280]   They do.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.720]   This is before cooking, I think.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.120]   This was an early form of cooking.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.280]   It was fermenting.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.160]   And it's because things would go bad.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:06.560]   So you had to eat them when they were just a little bad,
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.520]   where you could eat them when they were really bad.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:13.360]   Preservation involves salt, drying, fermentation,
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   or starvation.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.680]   Great burn-of-out loot, basically.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.640]   Hey, look, the rock.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.600]   It looks like this shark has fermented a little bit.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.120]   What do you think?
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.480]   You eat it?
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.080]   Loot-fisk, they actually soak it in lye.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.320]   Loot-fisk means lye fish.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.560]   So you soak it in poison, basically.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.920]   And then you have to leach the poison out
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.040]   and then reconstitute it.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:32.720]   It's revolted.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.080]   When we were in Christensen in Norway, which
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.840]   is on the farthest west coast of Norway,
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.840]   they were famous for their cliff-fisk, which is cod.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.320]   Right.
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:47.400]   Which is cod, which is dried on the cliffs.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:47.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.480]   In the sun.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.600]   It becomes cardboard.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.520]   You could kill somebody with it.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.600]   It's like a frisbee.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.520]   The loot-fisk, they stack it up.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.600]   It's like plywood.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.120]   The guy, a nice landed guy, showed me this stuff
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.800]   they have called Brinven, which is a horrible, revolting
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.120]   alcohol that I'm not sure what it's made from.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.360]   But I said, why on earth would anybody drink this?
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.600]   And he said, that's the only way you can get down the shark.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.920]   Pretty slowly, but the heart.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.600]   Makes the shark taste good.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.120]   I think a lot of-- it's interesting how taste is really
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.880]   conditioned by what you grew up with.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.380]   It is.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:24.880]   It is.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.000]   And if you look at what people actually eat around the world,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.480]   somebody was starving at some point.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:29.920]   And they--
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.720]   Actually, someone in the chat room just reminded me
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.680]   of something which is related to your cheese.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.560]   And I won't go into that in any more detail.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.440]   But they mentioned this Chinese delicacy called 1,000 year
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.760]   old eggs for black eggs, which basically go bad.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.040]   And then they're horrible.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.360]   They bury them.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.600]   And you eat them, yeah.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.600]   And I mentioned this to a Chinese friend of mine.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.840]   And I said this sounded like just a horribly revolting food.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.080]   And he said, you know what?
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.000]   You're right.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.640]   I thought the same thing when someone told me
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:58.600]   how you make cheese.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.400]   Uh-huh.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:28:59.920]   Like--
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:00.880]   They don't do dairy.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.080]   They don't do dairy in Asia.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.360]   And then you squish it together.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.640]   And then it goes even more bad.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.160]   And then stuff grows on it.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:09.080]   And then it smells so bad, you can barely get it in your mouth.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.000]   And I said, you know what?
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.560]   Now that you mention it, that does sound horrible.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:13.880]   Don't look it up.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.400]   Then there's barmites.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.960]   No, that's not bad.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.200]   That's just yeast.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.000]   Don't look it up.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.760]   But the single worst food in the world is blue.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.520]   But don't look it up because you'll be sorry.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.120]   B-A-L-U-T.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.200]   You might be right.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   You might really wish you had the right to be forgetting.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:37.560]   Nexus 6 is coming out in five days, 29th.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.960]   We're going to do a live--
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.480]   We are.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   Stream.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.480]   Mike's going.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.320]   Mike's going.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:42.840]   Yes.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.400]   Mike's going.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.080]   Jason's going to be on vacation.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.280]   He poorly planned vacation.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.040]   He's going to be a nice one.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.000]   He planned my vacation.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.720]   Well before the event, had I known,
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.440]   I probably would have planned differently.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.560]   But I felt the same way when it was in New York City
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.960]   during the I-Rant events.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.200]   I would love to go to the event.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.880]   Also would love to go to vacation.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.320]   We will next week hear about the two new Nexus phones,
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:03.800]   we believe.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.280]   And you have been waiting, haven't you,
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:09.000]   Jeff Jarvis, to hear about this phone.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.920]   And then--
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.400]   I'll probably get the large one.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.080]   Except, except, you know, I got to say,
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.320]   I'm a little nervous about being made in China.
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:22.480]   You know, the latest ThinkPad revelations--
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.720]   Actually, it's not the ThinkPad.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.600]   It's Lenovo.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.800]   The ThinkPad, as far as we know, are clean.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.800]   What about them?
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.880]   Some Lenovo laptops.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.200]   You know, the first they had the Superfish thing on there.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:38.040]   Now we learned a couple of weeks ago that Lenovo was putting
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.360]   software on a Windows install that they would then,
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.120]   even if you wiped the hard drive,
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.800]   the BIOS and the Lenovo's would reinstall the software.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.080]   It was used to update.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.520]   I think it was used to update.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.280]   But it might have had other privacy implications.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:53.640]   And certainly--
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.720]   So it's not back.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.480]   But then again, iPhones are made in China, so--
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.840]   Everything is made in China.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.600]   Really, if that's your single concern,
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   I think you're at a luck.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.120]   That's true.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:08.640]   There are a few phones made in Thailand, I think,
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.000]   and maybe some in Japan.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.640]   They're getting a Windows phone.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.440]   But I don't think there's any phone made in the US.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.080]   For a while Motorola was assembling its phones in Texas,
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.720]   but they stopped doing that.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.920]   Yeah, I think the bigger Nexus that's slightly smaller
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:25.320]   than the-- I think we've-- as you said before,
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.440]   we've found probably the upper limit of big.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.480]   Six inches is as big as you want, I think.
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.680]   And it's called--
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.200]   So the slightly smaller--
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:36.040]   The 5X and the 6P.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.600]   Which color should I get if those are the real colors?
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.800]   I think that the dark one is nice.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:41.800]   So they don't have pink?
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:44.680]   That was a better than the 6.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.520]   It's just newer, Matthew.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.040]   Let me see.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:49.040]   I've never schmuck for this.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.760]   It's going to be smaller, actually.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.600]   The 6P will be 5.7 inches.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.480]   My phone is perfectly fine, Matthew.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.680]   You're absolutely right.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.120]   OK.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.000]   You're a pinurious Canadian, you.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:58.200]   I don't know.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.120]   I just don't have the 6P.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.480]   I'm wondering if it could be better or--
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:02.440]   I call pinary.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:08.800]   I have kayaks to pay for.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.600]   So I do think that the 6P is the right size.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.040]   This is a 5.7 inches.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.040]   This is the Note 5.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.960]   And that is-- I don't know why 0.3 inches makes a difference,
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.280]   but it does.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.680]   It's just-- the 6 is just a little too big.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:23.160]   But you're carrying a 6 right now.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.360]   I think you'd like a 5.7.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:26.840]   Which has got dirty, but this white case--
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.000]   That's stupid Google 5 case, yeah.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.960]   It is stupid, but it's what I like it because the button's--
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:33.960]   And you still haven't turned on 5?
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.400]   No.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   Why not?
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.800]   You don't want to know.
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.160]   OK.
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.440]   The main reason to get--
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.520]   It involved the French.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.440]   Just got the form.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.840]   The main reason to get the new Nexus is fingerprint reader,
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:48.560]   right?
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.560]   I have of the opinion now that you should not
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.680]   buy a phone that doesn't have a fingerprint reader period.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.880]   With Google, or other Android Pay, with Apple Pay,
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.920]   for a myriad of reasons and convenience as well.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.080]   So there is Run the Back, which actually
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.480]   is a sensible place to put it, I think.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:06.960]   It's--
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:08.520]   Yeah, it's the second best place to put it.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.080]   First best is the on/off switch.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.000]   It's right on the bottom where the Apple iPhone puts it,
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.640]   because you hold it naturally, and it's a great place.
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.200]   So I'm not sure.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.520]   You know, there's a new phone.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.240]   I can't remember which one is it that has it on the on/off
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.240]   switch, Jason.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.080]   That's a Sony.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.000]   That's a Sony.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.680]   That kind of seems sensible because you're
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.480]   going for the on/off switch anyway,
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.720]   and you just-- all you do is you touch it, and that's it.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.200]   I really like that one.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.680]   So we should get one of the new experiences when they come out.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.280]   But I'm sure we'll get-- which one are you getting, Jason?
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.760]   The 5X of the 6P.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:42.920]   Oh, it's difficult for me to choose.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.800]   I want to get them both.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.920]   But I don't know.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.640]   He asked me.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.200]   Honest.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:47.840]   He asked me.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.160]   He was hoping I would help the decision,
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.760]   because he was going to get whatever I didn't get.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:53.680]   I don't know.
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.680]   I mean, you're going to get-- so he could get--
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.160]   But I haven't decided.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.800]   The 5 from two years ago is still--
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:03.680]   almost still, in my opinion, probably one of the best
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.360]   Nexus devices that there has been.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.120]   So it's a good reason for me to check out the new 5.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.840]   Because it'll be in the larger screen.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.720]   Yeah, same manufacturer.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.680]   Same manufacturer.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.280]   The camera will be better, we're sure,
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:16.720]   because the LG G4 is actually is an excellent camera.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.480]   The Nexus 5, not so much.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:20.280]   Crossing my fingers that we finally
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.320]   have an Nexus device with a great camera.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.240]   With a great camera.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.800]   Hold out.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.680]   I'll hold out hope on that, but I'm not sure.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.760]   Is this the first--
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.800]   That's going to happen.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:32.240]   Is this the first major Huawei that we could get in America?
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:32.680]   Yes.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.240]   Yes.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.320]   Unless you went to--
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.000]   Right, you could buy it on a Chinese site.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.200]   No, but I mean--
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.000]   But I mean legitimately retail-ly.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:43.520]   Yes.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:44.760]   Huawei entrance in America.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.280]   This is the first time a Chinese Huawei or ZTE,
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.680]   or Xiaomi has sold a phone direct in the United States.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.600]   It's going to be the first time when
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.120]   you're going to see Huawei phones in the wild in America
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.520]   on a regular basis.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.240]   I have never seen one ever.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.960]   I've never seen anybody using a Huawei.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.840]   Well, you have a Xiaomi.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.560]   Don't you, Jason?
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:08.200]   You have a Xiaomi.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.680]   We have the Xiaomi Mi 4 here.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.480]   I mean, but we had to buy that online
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.360]   through some random channel in order to get it.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.680]   Huawei, you can buy their devices in the US
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.880]   by going to the Huawei site.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.240]   So you can get them here.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:22.920]   It's not a matter of importing them.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.080]   It's just-- I don't know if you can get Huawei devices
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:25.840]   through a carrier.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.320]   Like if you go into a carrier store,
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.480]   I don't know if they're going to be carrying Huawei devices.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:36.040]   5X will be 5.2 inches, the rumor mill says.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.880]   It looks just as ugly, frankly, as the 6P.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.040]   Both of them are kind of ugly.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.160]   That's the 6P.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.000]   No, this would be the 5X.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.480]   That's right here would be the 5X, yeah.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.760]   6P has a periscope on the top.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.160]   I'm really curious about that.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.600]   Both are not-- but see, Google doesn't
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.680]   need to make attractive.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.480]   I still think developer platforms.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.240]   I really don't think that they intend these
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.120]   to be consumer-grade, consumer-phones.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:03.560]   I hope so, because when they were really in the zone
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:06.280]   with making it sort of a phone, you could take a part
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.640]   and really tinker with, and everything was open,
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.160]   I thought that was really the way to go.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.000]   It was a differentiator for Google.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.480]   It's ironic, because Google really broke the mold
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.280]   when they started selling the Nexus 1.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.680]   It was the first phone not sold through a carrier.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.520]   And they stopped doing it because nobody bought--
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.520]   at the time--
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.320]   Somebody was used to buying them like that.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.440]   Nobody bought them.
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:32.880]   And now, even Apple is starting to be sold to a carrier list.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.240]   And Samsung.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:34.840]   And Samsung.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.760]   So I think that's the wave of the future.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.360]   Maybe the time is right for Google
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:43.160]   to get back into the consumer market with the Nexus.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.560]   People who have the Nexus-- now it's mostly our audience,
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.720]   who are Geeks and Fucius, but they love it.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.560]   They're like you, Jason.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.720]   They say this is the best phone ever.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:54.160]   I mean, there's a lot of value to the update aspect
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:57.280]   of owning a Nexus, especially for--
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.720]   fans of the platform.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.040]   They want the-- to be as up to date as possible.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.760]   And that's worth being on an Nexus for.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.400]   That's why I got the Nexus.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.520]   I mean, that's why I didn't get a set phone.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:09.200]   It's your Android LG.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.720]   It's really too bad, because that's a big--
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.320]   that's kind of the fatal flaw of Android right now,
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.560]   is that not all phones get that luxury.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.520]   And unfortunately, the majority of people
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.640]   get the phones that don't have that luxury.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.120]   And so it ends up being a big problem.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.160]   Type C connector.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.200]   I'm actually happy about that.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.040]   Well, the OnePlus 2 is a Type C, but really,
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.560]   it's just a USB 2 port.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:32.120]   Mascrating is a 3.1 port.
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.960]   And what we really want is the full speed 3.1 Type C port
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.120]   that goes-- it's bidirectional.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.400]   So I mean, that would be remarkable.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:45.800]   And I'm hoping that they do that.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.480]   We're also going to see a new Apple TV.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.800]   No.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.440]   We already--
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.400]   New Chromecast.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.840]   New Chromecast, I'm sorry.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.560]   It's starting to blur.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.440]   Sorry, buddy.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.080]   It's device season that happens.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.240]   It's always device season now.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.760]   There's no time off.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.320]   What do we know about the new Chromecast?
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.160]   Funny looking.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:07.800]   It's a shape.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.800]   It looks like a ping pong paddle or something.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.360]   Whoopee cushion was what Flo said last night.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.920]   It really does kind of look like a whoopee cushion.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.840]   I think that has to do with antenna, I would guess.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.680]   It's going to be--
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.520]   That's hot.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.080]   You got better Wi-Fi.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.960]   You should get better Wi-Fi.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.080]   It doesn't matter because it's behind the TV anyway, right?
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.200]   Which is interesting because you're
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:31.880]   seeing colored options for something
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.680]   that you're just going to have stuck behind the TV.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.600]   Did they have rose gold?
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.880]   They, well, they have pink.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.120]   It looks like they're maybe red, I don't know.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.640]   I really think the Chromecast does not get enough respect.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.960]   I still think that's the best device out there.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.800]   Yeah, I mean, no.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.800]   I think it's pretty great.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.640]   35 bucks.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.160]   Even though mine seems to have problems connecting
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.960]   to the Wi-Fi network, and I don't know why.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.480]   It just periodically won't.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.480]   I don't think that's typical.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.600]   I have great results, effective.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.560]   It does better than most of the other devices.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.200]   It could be my janky network, too.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:05.560]   You know what?
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.240]   Wi-Fi's gotten worse because everybody, even at the lake,
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.640]   now everybody has it.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.600]   Well, that's one of the features, supposedly,
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.600]   of the new Chromecast's AC support.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.520]   So faster internet.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.760]   That would be good.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.400]   I would play all that kind of stuff.
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.520]   I wonder if it will do anything special with the new router?
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:23.720]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.520]   So happy that I did not buy the on hub.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:32.200]   So Jake did hook it up, said that it wasn't basically
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.800]   equal the house of the average.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.080]   It's overpriced for an average Wi-Fi router.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.840]   I'm very happy with the Asus AC3200, which
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.600]   will be at the top of the line for a few days more
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.760]   until a new one comes out.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.440]   Do we know--
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.440]   I'm interested in that Chromecast audio,
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.480]   which is also in the lineup, I think.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:55.920]   Yeah, that step could be interesting for sort of non-Sonos
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.440]   users.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.360]   Which is funny because that's my Wi-Fi name.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.160]   I name my Wi-Fi after dead rock stars.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.760]   I have Hendrix Winehouse, Joplin.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:05.600]   It's easy to remember.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:12.960]   You plug these into your speakers around the house
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.960]   and then that synchronizes the music going--
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.440]   It's Sonos.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.320]   It basically kind of is.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.960]   It turns your speakers into a Sonos.
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.720]   Yeah, instead of a specific Sonos speaker.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.400]   Now, it's very hard using just Wi-Fi to synchronize speakers
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.080]   all around the house.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.080]   People have been able to cobble this kind of thing
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:30.800]   together before.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.560]   It's not that hard to do with Bluetooth dongles,
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:33.680]   Wi-Fi dongles.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.760]   But the problem is that a speaker in the living room
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:37.960]   is slightly off from the speaker in the bedroom.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.200]   And you hear this kind of echoing effect that's not good.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.240]   Sonos has some sort of secret sauce.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.480]   They do their own network that seems to really eliminate that.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.120]   It's amazing.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.920]   You put it in party mode, all your speakers,
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.720]   and I have a lot of them, are all in sync.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.080]   And you can literally walk-- the whole house is rocking.
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.320]   And you can walk anywhere and they're all in sync.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.920]   But that's not trivial.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:02.080]   Is it using the Wi-Fi access point inside the house
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.560]   or is it talking to each other?
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.960]   Because it's all connected network.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:05.760]   Does it's okay?
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.320]   I wonder if this is going to do the same thing.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.960]   You have to do that.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.760]   Although they did add Wi-Fi recently.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.320]   They did, yeah.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.240]   Yeah, I don't use it.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:17.400]   But the mesh network works quite well.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:19.320]   You use Wi-Fi to configure it, obviously.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.480]   And it uses Wi-Fi to get radio or whatever.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.280]   But somehow they synchronize themselves
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.320]   through their own devices.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:31.920]   Hendrix, it has a 3.5 millimeter headphone cable,
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:36.560]   one that goes into Hendrix, one that goes into your speaker.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.360]   So you presumably have powered--
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.160]   you need powered speakers.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:41.800]   That makes sense.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.280]   Why not let people buy their own speakers?
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:48.400]   That's one of the-- with Sonos, you have to generally
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.240]   use their speakers, although they do have a connect that
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.640]   allows you to use your own speakers.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:55.280]   I use that.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.080]   No.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.600]   This is going to be a big announcement.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.920]   September 29th, what time does it start?
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.360]   9am Pacific.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.120]   Now, the home run would be-- and I don't think they're
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.760]   going to do it-- but the home run would
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:10.440]   be to make this something like an Amazon Echo type
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:11.800]   of interaction with Google.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:12.760]   That's what I want.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:13.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.280]   Big, big.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.280]   Just have this-- the voice be throughout the house,
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.160]   wherever there's a speaker.
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:18.520]   We did.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.240]   I mentioned this on Windows Weekly.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:24.000]   I apologize if you watch both shows.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.080]   So Lisa and I are parking this morning in the lot.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.320]   And we drove by a nice-looking Corvette,
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.120]   had a badge on it.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.600]   It said 50.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.800]   And I said, what does that mean?
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.440]   That's the 50th anniversary edition Corvette.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.560]   I said, has Corvette been around that long?
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.320]   She said, I don't know.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.640]   Let me ask Siri.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.920]   And in my head, I said, oh, you have
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.800]   a lot of unjustified faith in Siri.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.040]   So why don't you go ahead and ask Siri, when
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.000]   was the Corvette first released?
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.600]   Just see what we can get.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.440]   When was the Corvette first released?
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.880]   Checking my sources.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:01.680]   Here's what I found on the web for when
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.200]   was the Corvette first released?
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.960]   So Siri is kind of dumb.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:08.000]   And she gave me the Wikipedia M34.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.520]   OK, Google.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:11.120]   OK, Google.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.120]   I shouldn't have said it twice.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:17.920]   We've got to really be conditioned how to use these machines.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.320]   OK, Google.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.920]   When was the Corvette first released?
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.720]   June 30, 1953.
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.920]   According to Wikipedia--
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.560]   Now then it goes on and on.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.720]   It's like your little friend.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.720]   It's like the cliff-claving.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.800]   It's a remodel here.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:32.720]   Originally decided.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:33.720]   It's a little bit of a--
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.720]   Nice.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.720]   The Mustang.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.720]   I get the Mustang is also--
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:37.720]   Can't do your auto show.
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:38.720]   It's generated.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.520]   To induce GM to make a production.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.520]   It's really cliff-claving.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.800]   Well, actually, I don't know if you know this,
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.800]   but it actually adduced GM to reduce
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.800]   their production.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.280]   It's doing their production.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.440]   But the point being, really--
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.680]   And that's the new Siri.
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:54.520]   That's the new Siri.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.520]   That's the new smarter Siri.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:59.560]   So and we did it with a few other things you just see.
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.560]   And I have to say, Google really still.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.400]   And then I asked Paul Therat to try it with Cortana.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.440]   The problem is Siri and Cortana, both of you,
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.440]   use Bing Search.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.440]   So it had the same issue.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.440]   You know, it's--
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:12.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:16.360]   What's funny is that we talk a lot about these virtual assistants,
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.680]   but the most interesting one by far is Microsoft.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:20.680]   Oh.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.680]   No.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:22.680]   Microsoft's Chinese one called Shao Ice.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.680]   I haven't tried Shao Ice.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:25.440]   Shao Ice is not an assistant.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.440]   It doesn't help you.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.680]   I don't know if you can try it in English.
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:29.760]   I think it's only in Mandarin or something like that.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.760]   Well, let's get--
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:35.160]   But according to John Markoff, with the New York Times,
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.680]   who Megan and I interviewed at the other day for our--
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:38.880]   I love John Markoff.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.000]   Yeah, he's awesome.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.080]   He did a great article in the New York Times a couple of weeks
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.280]   ago where he pointed out that 25% of Shao Ice users have told it,
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.880]   I love you.
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:49.720]   Wow.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.240]   It's not a personal assistant.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.560]   It's a chat bot.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.640]   So what they do is they mine the Chinese social media
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.000]   for what people say and what people say in response
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.240]   to those things.
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.080]   And they pack all this into the database.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.200]   So when you interact with it, you're essentially
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.800]   talking to the Chinese hive mind.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.040]   And it also learns about you personally.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.080]   So it becomes a trend.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.880]   There's no mind like the Chinese hive mind.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:12.120]   There's nothing we tell you, folks.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.200]   Exactly.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.920]   But it's supposed to be amazing.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:17.320]   People go off and spend a lot of time with this thing.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.520]   So here's the translation that the time is published.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.840]   That sounds like her.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.440]   So it does sound like her.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.240]   I want her, by the way.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:29.200]   If her ever comes out, I'm never leaving the house.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:35.320]   So the questions they're asking, this is the Chinese speaker.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.840]   I'll do her in a hive voice.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:39.360]   Hannah, do you want to see my pet dog?
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.760]   How old is it?
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.440]   Have a look first, then guess.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:43.920]   Can you give me a hint?
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.800]   I want to hug and pet it.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.120]   Eight years old.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.200]   I was pretty close.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.960]   Give or take 10 years.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:52.000]   I took my dog for a walk today.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.760]   If you don't walk or feed it, it will be pushing daisies
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.240]   after a while.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:59.280]   You could keep it in a greenhouse.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.720]   That's no good.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:02.040]   This is like a liza.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.960]   Yeah, I was just going to say it's a liza.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.280]   What would you do then?
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.160]   Build a home for it inside.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:11.240]   Set up a home, warm hat.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.920]   I don't know where I don't--
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.840]   What do you think of my cooking?
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.040]   Nice hug.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:18.920]   Just to make-- I'm sure-- oh, then she
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.560]   sends a picture of her food.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:23.440]   I'm sure you said that picture just to make my mouth water.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.560]   That's impressive.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.800]   Watsum?
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.960]   Anything delicious?
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.440]   I have to try.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:29.760]   How did I do?
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.040]   I think you're great, smiley face.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.320]   Picture of two dogs.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:37.240]   I can tell right away it's a purebred husky.
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.760]   Huskies.
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.000]   I'm going to go back to the cliff claver boys.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.040]   Huskies are the goofballs of the dog world
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.800]   and they're fighter jets of the goofball world.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.000]   Look at those cute little eyes.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.120]   Aren't they just dreamy?
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:50.200]   What do you think is the best way to describe this kind of dog?
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.840]   My dog likes to play outside.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.920]   Does it have fun?
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.840]   A lot of fun.
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.080]   I'm having fun, too.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.200]   What do you think of my dog?
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:57.040]   Really beautiful.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.360]   It's driving me crazy.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   This is a good Eliza.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.600]   This is just a good Eliza.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.480]   Yes.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.560]   Ask it when the Corvette was first released.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.400]   That's what I want to know.
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:06.560]   How about this?
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.440]   Imagine those two things combined.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.480]   Imagine if you had a chat pod and the original chat
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.520]   pods were supposed to do that.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.280]   But imagine if you had one that had the intelligence
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.880]   of Google Now or Siri at it.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.520]   That would be--
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.560]   This is just around the corner because, of course,
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.440]   messaging is the hot platform right now, Facebook, big time
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:26.360]   pushing into that with them and other things.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.200]   What's app?
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:29.240]   I'm a big fan of Telegram.
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:33.200]   The creator of Telegram, the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia,
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:37.560]   Pavel Dorov, who ran when Putin basically confiscated
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.280]   his company and is in Berlin right now.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.760]   Actually, I think he has a place of no known abode
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.520]   because he's probably still a little scary Putin.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.160]   But he created Telegram as a private messaging service.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.760]   He told TechCrunch disrupt on Monday
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:56.920]   that they have gone from one billion messages a day in January
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:01.440]   to 12 billion messages a day.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.440]   But not much of an increase in monthly active users,
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.600]   about 60 million, which is still a small fraction of what's
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.040]   app does.
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.000]   Well, I remember when somebody told me
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.840]   what's app had exceeded the entire SMS network globally.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:17.840]   Wow.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.880]   It wasn't that long ago.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.760]   Messaging is hot.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.120]   There's no-- I mean, it's the thing.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.080]   And I think the key on messaging is to add these features.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.560]   Telegram has great-- I have a bot on Telegram.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:28.720]   That's great bots.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:29.280]   I think it's better.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.520]   I think it's a little untelligrant.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.480]   Pardon me?
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.000]   Not many.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.040]   That's part of the problem.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.600]   But I have 400 people following my Telegram bot.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.000]   That's pretty good.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.440]   The thing that's interesting about--
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:40.840]   What does your bot do?
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:43.160]   It says things like, Leo, just arrived at the studio.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.200]   I have it connected with my car has an automatic.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.320]   So when I pull up and turn off the ignition
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.840]   at a certain geographic area, it tells the bot
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.120]   and the bot goes, Leo's just pulled up.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.640]   Maybe it shows about to begin.
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.560]   And then it looks at my calendar.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.680]   And when it shows it says that.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.160]   When I post to Instagram, it posts.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.200]   It's just-- it's kind of a way of aggregating different stuff.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.000]   And it helps us hearing stuff, because we put away
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.200]   the scratch and tell strippers.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:08.200]   Run away the strippers.
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:09.800]   Get a Leo's pulled up.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.240]   Unfortunately, the bot that technology I'm using
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:14.120]   has gotten latent.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.080]   And so it's now like three hours later.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:18.840]   It's saying, Leo, just pulled up.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:19.800]   So here's one other thing.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.520]   The soundhound folks have hound.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.020]   Yes.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.200]   Only on Android and Zin beta.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.640]   And it's very interesting, because it is a weird kind
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:29.200]   of cross-site search.
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:31.200]   So they promote things like, you could say,
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:33.160]   show me hotels in Seattle for this weekend that
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:35.160]   cost less than 300 bucks.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.880]   Japanese restaurants in San Francisco
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.640]   within walking distance of the ferry building.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.240]   Those things would be very useful.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.600]   I found it'd be--
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.080]   Oh, where the camera--
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.240]   I know the camera's placed on.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:45.840]   I'm always sorry to walk.
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:49.000]   So I found it very interesting, because it's incredibly fast.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.360]   I'll just use one of those samples.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:51.860]   Watch it.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:54.640]   Give me a sample so we don't--
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:55.920]   let's see.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.720]   Hotels in Santa Rosa--
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.160]   Better child friendly under $200.
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.880]   Give me some hotels in Santa Rosa that are child friendly
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:07.720]   for under $300.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.560]   Maybe child friendly is--
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.360]   It got all--
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.760]   --two results near Santa Rosa for maximum of $300 US
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.000]   per night that are family hotels.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:16.920]   Family hotels.
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:17.400]   Wow.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:17.600]   Wow.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:18.840]   That's pretty good.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.920]   That's really good.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.520]   I wonder, though.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:21.040]   Let's see.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.240]   It's very fast.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.720]   When was the Corvette released?
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:31.040]   Showing search results for when was the Corvette released?
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:32.320]   Not so useful.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.640]   What time is it in Peru right now?
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:38.080]   What time is it in Peru right now?
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:40.480]   It is 5.21 PM in Peru.
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.680]   I don't know how they make it so fast, by the way.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:46.320]   That's got to be as close to instant as you can get.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:47.880]   By the way, that's important.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:49.800]   Siri sometimes takes a really long time.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:53.160]   Alexa-- the Echo with Alexa is very fast as well.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.240]   Much faster than Siri.
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.560]   We have little contest and race.
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.360]   Time for Alexa.
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:57.560]   It's so good.
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:01.320]   And I think that Geeks now who have Alexa--
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:02.400]   I'm sorry, Echo.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.200]   I shouldn't say that.
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.200]   They were.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.000]   Geeks now who have Echo, I'm seeing a lot of them
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.840]   kind of sharing our--
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.080]   like, you know what?
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.920]   This is really good.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.120]   This is really interesting.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:17.560]   And it's not so different from talking to Siri or Google,
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.320]   but I think it's because it's your house.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:20.320]   And it's just--
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:21.320]   It's always there.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:22.320]   Yeah, you're talking to your house.
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:23.880]   The other thing is I've noticed multiple improvements
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:24.920]   that just happen.
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:28.320]   So we'd use it heavily for timers.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:29.880]   And we have multiple timers.
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.280]   And now it keeps track of them.
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.840]   It's like, well, this is one timer.
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:33.840]   This is the second timer.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.400]   Would you like to cancel the 10 minute timer?
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.000]   Or the 40,000--
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000]   Yeah, it had multiple timers.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.880]   Just a month ago, that didn't exist.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:40.120]   It also has multiple accounts.
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:43.080]   So Lisa had an Audible account, and I have an Audible account.
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:45.160]   And I can say, switch accounts, read my book,
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:46.120]   and it will read Lisa's book.
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.040]   Switch accounts, read my book.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:47.960]   It'll read my book.
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:48.960]   Yep.
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.800]   I use the timers for tea.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.320]   Me too.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.200]   It's a great tea timer.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:53.160]   It's great.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.400]   We just-- timers, the weather.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.560]   Sometimes what time it is, if I have my hands full,
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.560]   I want to know what time it is.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:00.560]   It's like a little buddy.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.200]   We use it for conversions, like how many teaspoons
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:05.080]   and a gallon and--
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:06.520]   But imagine mixing that Chinese.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.640]   My wife would just shoot me.
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:10.000]   No, she would.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.880]   No kids, my wife, they would all do.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.440]   Or you've gone over it.
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:13.440]   They would all love it.
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:14.240]   They would all love it.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:15.400]   No, they would come around.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:15.840]   You know what?
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:16.840]   I thought the same thing.
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:18.920]   I told Lisa that now, don't be mad at me.
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.920]   But we're going to put this thing in here.
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:23.280]   If you hate it, I'll take it out.
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:24.440]   She loves it.
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.280]   We got a second one.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.120]   I think your wife would like it, Jeff.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:32.960]   But when I dictate a text, she just--
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.280]   No, but this isn't like that.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.240]   This is more like you ask a question.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:37.600]   And you get an answer.
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.840]   And she actually has some smart things.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:42.240]   You can say who shot first and stuff like that.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.920]   Why doesn't Google have something like that?
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920]   Exactly.
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:45.520]   That's my question.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:46.120]   That's my question.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:46.720]   That's my question.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:49.960]   And I bet you on the 29th, they will.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:52.600]   Google now has-- it's been around so long,
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:54.320]   and it's had such a great reputation.
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:55.960]   But you have to actively say, I'm
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:58.800]   going to go find and use Google now now.
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.800]   Whereas Alexis, just you talk, and it answers.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:01.920]   It's like, that's how it should be.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.040]   That's how Google now should be.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:03.520]   It will be.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:04.800]   So the ambient internet.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.560]   I predict that maybe even with that little Hendrix will do.
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.600]   I hope so.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.880]   Well, and if it comes with Scarlett Johansson's voice,
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.920]   you know, they're going to walk.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:15.320]   It was an last week show that we had Siri's voice,
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:17.040]   the woman who does Siri.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.920]   We've never had the woman who does Siri on the show.
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:21.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:23.680]   Someone else on the show.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:26.440]   I talked about her on iOS today.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:26.880]   Oh, she--
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:27.560]   She does not say it.
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.560]   She-- you've seen Susan Bennett.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:32.080]   Susan Bennett has a demo reel in which she
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:34.400]   interviews herself as Siri.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.080]   Was that it?
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:36.520]   No, no, no, no.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:39.000]   I know I remember a friend of mine suddenly,
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.080]   Susan Bennett is following him on Facebook.
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.760]   You hear if you're on why.
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:43.880]   But she's the voice of Siri.
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.400]   So he feels like he's, you know, touched a celebrity.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.400]   That was--
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.200]   He can't figure out why.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:52.080]   Here, let's hear Susan Bennett.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.960]   Here today with one of my alter egos, Siri.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:55.640]   Siri here.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:57.200]   May I call you Siri?
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.440]   Call me Rock Goddess.
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.160]   OK, Rock Goddess.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:00.800]   This is a little weird.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.320]   On the iPhone and iPad.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:05.120]   Where have we heard your-- my voice?
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.400]   Did you see Mission Impossible 4?
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.600]   4 hours, 52 minutes.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.520]   Delta Airlines Gates Worldwide.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.840]   Thank you for choosing Delta Airlines.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:15.360]   What about TV and radio?
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.880]   Searching the web for Siri.
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.240]   Susan Bennett, voice over.
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.920]   Chiquita, quite possibly the world's perfect food.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:24.080]   You can have it all right now with the accurate TSX.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:25.680]   And Papa John's, we don't have to keep--
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:27.120]   She's getting all over the career.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.840]   This is her voice of her demo reel.
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.480]   Oh, there's big money in this.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:32.440]   It's kind of ironic.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:35.160]   She was the voice of the first ATM machine.
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:35.720]   Was she?
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:36.240]   Wow.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.240]   Wow.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.000]   Tilly the all-time teller.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.280]   First automated teller machine.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:43.120]   Tilly the all-time teller.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:44.640]   You know what pisses me off?
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.280]   Newark Airport.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.280]   The announcement was like, don't hate me.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.800]   Don't leave your thing around.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.480]   It's a southern accent.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.360]   It's a New York accent.
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:52.880]   Hi.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:53.720]   Welcome to Newark.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.520]   Hey, yo.
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.520]   Hey.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:55.520]   Hey.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.960]   Don't you leave your box around?
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:58.360]   Stop doing that.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.400]   Really, it's a southern accent.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:00.880]   Southern accent.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:04.080]   I bet they did research that found that people are less--
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.840]   that that's more-- don't you think if somebody
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:08.680]   said with a nice southern, hunted southern accent--
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:10.840]   I tried to gee graphically offensive.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:12.840]   You know, one of the--
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:13.840]   You're proud of our accents.
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:18.680]   You know, one of the most appealing accents, apparently.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.160]   And this is not just because I'm Canadian.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.160]   It's the Canadian accent because it's almost--
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:22.640]   Of course.
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.560]   It's not obvious.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:27.440]   So it's not offensive because it's obviously
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.680]   some other place.
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:31.720]   But they will actually teach people who don't do voiceovers
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:34.000]   to try and simulate a Canadian accent.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.480]   Because it's supposed to not be made up.
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.880]   It takes us something that they made up in Canada.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:38.960]   I don't think that's true.
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.240]   No, I think that's true.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.240]   Totally true.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.600]   The exception of the OU and the Double E.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:46.360]   Yeah, obviously they don't do the ood and a boo thing.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:46.960]   But the--
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:48.280]   Or the Double E.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:50.000]   It's different enough.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000]   It's different enough, but close enough.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.320]   OK, I'll take your word for it.
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.600]   I think that's a nice supporting researcher.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:02.600]   And there are multiple Canadian accents.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.160]   And some of them are nicer than others, I have to say.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:06.840]   Right.
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:08.680]   Agreed.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:09.200]   But--
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:11.880]   Do you want to talk more about Signal?
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:15.280]   You wrote a nice article about it in "Fortune"?
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.840]   Yeah, I think that's really interesting.
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:21.440]   I mean, it's obvious that technology actually, I don't
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.840]   think, is all that interesting.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:24.480]   It's not--
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:26.000]   What happens?
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.040]   So it's a way of-- it's a tool, effectively,
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.680]   for journalists to find things that are newsworthy
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:35.440]   on Facebook and Instagram.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:36.440]   So Facebook wants--
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:39.120]   And reshare it or to actually use it on their--
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:40.880]   To embed it.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:41.360]   To embed it.
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.600]   It's basically a dashboard that gives you
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.400]   an easy way to search for terms, keywords, et cetera,
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.520]   hashtags.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.200]   And then you can find content that's been posted.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.720]   You can rank it effectively.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.600]   And then you can aggregate it, curate it,
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:58.920]   and embed it easily.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:56:59.920]   So Twitter is something--
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.000]   So Twitter's done this too, right?
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:04.160]   I forget what Twitter's is called.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:07.440]   But curator or something like that.
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.640]   I just thought it was interesting that Facebook has been
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.720]   making a whole bunch of moves in various ways
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:16.920]   to try and appeal more to media companies.
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:19.520]   So I think this is one aspect of that.
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:21.920]   They're trying to get media companies to put their content
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:22.720]   on the platforms.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.000]   They're trying to make it more appealing for media entities
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.320]   to work with Facebook.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.760]   They're trying to reach out more.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.520]   And I think this is--
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:35.040]   they're trying to get, obviously, Facebook content
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.840]   highlighted in news reports as well.
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:41.000]   I'm kind of--
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.120]   day after tomorrow, Apple's new iPhone comes out
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.400]   and it features something called Live Photos.
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:47.280]   Facebook and Apple have already been working together
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:49.800]   to put Live Photos in the iOS app of Facebook.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.720]   Facebook has also announced that they're
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:57.160]   going to allow 360 degree video in its news feed video
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:00.840]   that you could create with a variety of cameras like GoPros.
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:06.360]   And actually, I hope that the Ricoh Theta will do work with it.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.200]   Did you ever play with the Theta?
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:07.200]   I did.
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.160]   Did you ever review it?
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:08.600]   I did.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:09.040]   I did.
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:10.520]   And there's a new version--
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:11.320]   Which I've ordered.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.680]   I cannot wait to get it.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:13.680]   It's going to be great.
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:15.200]   And you absolutely can do.
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.200]   Absolutely.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:21.040]   It looks like an Apple TV remote.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:22.520]   It's just a little kind of thing.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:24.120]   There's a fish eye lens on either side.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:28.760]   And it'll take a 360 degree, not just still, but live video.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.960]   And that, to me, is very interesting.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.320]   You know what I want to do?
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:34.960]   I want to do a serious show like this.
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.000]   And you could watch it.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.800]   And then the ideas you could look around.
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:40.560]   But then have dancing girls on the other side of the camera.
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.680]   And we're just serious and we're talking like this.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.760]   And if somebody should, by chance, look over-- look over.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:46.120]   Look at what that--
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.880]   Or circus clowns with a chainsaw.
[01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:51.000]   Or circus clowns are just like weird stuff on the other side.
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:52.760]   They actually did that with HD.
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.400]   Do you remember some shows would actually
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.560]   have special content that you could only
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:57.760]   see if you had HD?
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:58.760]   HDF?
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.320]   What does it look like?
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.600]   Well, there would be something in the frame
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.200]   that you could only see.
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:07.800]   Oh, because it was widescreen on the edges.
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.560]   It's just like that.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:10.320]   Now I ordered this.
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:10.820]   I don't know.
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:12.080]   It's supposed to come out pretty soon.
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:13.280]   Is that the one?
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:14.640]   Yeah, the theta S.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:17.000]   The problem with the one you had is the quality was pretty bad.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:17.600]   It's pretty low.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.200]   And this is supposed to be much better.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.040]   And also the quality of what they do--
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.480]   So obviously, there's part of the world that
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:26.840]   can't be seen through a camera because the camera's
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:27.360]   in the way.
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:27.860]   Right.
[01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:30.080]   So the bottom sort of center.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.800]   And they have this supposedly great software that sort of
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:36.960]   stitches it together in a way that makes it vanish somehow.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.360]   I'm afraid I'm going to throw up when I look at my Facebook
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:39.720]   feed.
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:40.520]   Like I'm afraid.
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:42.360]   It's going to get very rich.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.400]   Oh, you know what's driving me nuts, Matthew?
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.160]   You know what's driving me completely nuts right now?
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:47.440]   Trigger, trigger, trigger, trigger, trigger.
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.920]   For me, you're going to love this, folks.
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:52.640]   The movie about the guy who walked across the Twin Towers.
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.440]   Oh, I don't want to see that at all.
[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.680]   The previews, the thought of it--
[01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:58.120]   I'm doing it to myself right now.
[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:01.240]   Between that and my 9/11 thing and my heights,
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:04.360]   it's just the perfect storm for my psychosis.
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:07.200]   There is an incredible documentary about this guy that
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:08.200]   came out a few years ago.
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:08.800]   It's amazing, yeah.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:09.800]   Ever seen.
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:10.640]   Ever.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:13.160]   Philippe Petite, he did it in 1974.
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:16.200]   He strung a high wire.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:18.000]   Don't show any video, man.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.880]   Don't show this.
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:21.520]   I shouldn't torture Jeff like this.
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.160]   He strung a high wire across the--
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.520]   between the two towers and walked across him.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:27.920]   Of course, no net because--
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:30.400]   No, no, stop, stop, stop.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:32.240]   I don't want to see-- it makes me a little queasy.
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:35.360]   I've seen the movie trailers and I'm going, ah.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.240]   Is it safe?
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:37.280]   Yes, it's safe.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:41.520]   Imagine if it was a 360 degree auto play video of that.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.800]   Oh.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:47.360]   I've seen some videos of like sort of amateur Russian daredevils
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:48.520]   as kids who go up on the top of his door.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:49.440]   Oh, they're crazy.
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.080]   And they do summer salts on the edge and they hang over just
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.360]   the guys on the other guy.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.720]   And it just makes people--
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.080]   Before Jeff, because those are very popular on Facebook,
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:58.920]   you must see those all the time.
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:00:59.360]   I can't.
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:00.360]   I can't.
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:02.320]   They're the previews for Everest.
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:02.800]   No.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.800]   So you probably would never go somewhere
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:10.240]   like on the Hancock building in Chicago
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:12.520]   where the floor is glass.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.840]   Doo-hoo.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.920]   Well, you know who does that?
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:17.040]   Those are just a Canadian.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:18.680]   C and tower, baby.
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:19.440]   C and tower.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.680]   Oh, that's creepy.
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:21.920]   That's C and tower.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:24.840]   Although I went up there and had dinner once
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:25.880]   because it rotates.
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:26.800]   Yeah, it's great.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:27.800]   And that's a beautiful view.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:30.280]   And the floor is opaque.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.120]   Actually, was sitting there.
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.920]   It was Michael Olin, my photography friend and I.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:36.520]   And somebody proposed to his girlfriend right next to us.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:36.920]   He got on his--
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:37.960]   There's a lot of that.
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.160]   Yeah, but there's a lot of the canes.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:40.920]   I think he's always--
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:41.420]   Right.
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:42.520]   I haven't done the--
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:44.240]   the edge walk yet.
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:46.160]   Yeah, that I actually didn't do because I don't
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:47.000]   know how well I would do.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.400]   I would like to.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:49.280]   Really?
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.040]   Yeah, I would do it.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:52.640]   So we-- it's official now.
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:55.320]   The final count is in.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:00.200]   And we ordered 18 fire tablets, Amazon's--
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:01.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:02.520]   Amazon's new--
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:02.880]   I'm telling you.
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:05.440]   Amazon's new fire tablet.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.120]   They sell in a six pack if you want it.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.120]   And--
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.080]   For the price of five.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:13.240]   For the price of five, you get a sixth.
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.560]   Father Robert saw this.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.320]   And I think he was kind of surprised.
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:19.040]   He sent out an email saying, hey, you know, these tablets
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:22.200]   end up being like $46 when we all chip--
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.600]   did anybody want one?
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.840]   $3, six packs later.
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.680]   Wow.
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:28.560]   Yep.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.120]   Crazy.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:29.920]   Closeable.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:30.600]   Yep.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:33.080]   Well, the best thing that's going to happen is, you know,
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:34.840]   newspapers have tried for years to give away
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:35.760]   troubles to get usage.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:36.440]   Yep.
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:36.920]   Yep.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:38.560]   Now, what's your most--
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:41.080]   And the thing is that after taxes,
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:44.800]   each one of them, if you get the six for the price of five,
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:47.000]   is $48 and--
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.760]   I don't know, $30, something sounds like that.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:49.720]   Super cheap.
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:50.880]   I mean, that is-- are you getting one?
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:51.720]   I'm getting one.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:52.360]   That was the first one.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.320]   Yeah, good pool, man.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:56.880]   If you lose one, or you leave it in your hotel, or--
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:57.360]   Yeah.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:59.840]   Even if you use it as a cutting board, it's a good price.
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:03.400]   Yeah, cutting boards are--
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:04.760]   Exactly.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.040]   Oh, I like that.
[02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:06.560]   I got this idea.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:07.480]   I got flat.
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:09.520]   Elga-- Elga-- at the Elga household, right?
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:10.920]   The cheese board is a fire.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:12.120]   I would use sliced the cheese.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:13.600]   It tells you about the cheese you're selling.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:14.120]   Oh.
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:15.040]   Yeah, that's a great--
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:16.720]   It made this kind of big.
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.360]   That's a pretty thick slice there, Fadi.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.800]   You might have wanted to knock off on that.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.960]   That's the one I need.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:23.960]   That's--
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.000]   Do they read somewhere that they were kind of clean up
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.880]   the Android on the fire tablets, make it more--
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:30.400]   Yes, it doesn't have the carousel anymore, I think.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.200]   Yeah.
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:34.920]   The thing about these tablets that is the important takeaway
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:37.280]   is they've abandoned their illusion
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:40.080]   that they are a compelling tablet in comparison
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:40.920]   with other tablets.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:43.560]   And they basically said, if you're a prime member,
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:47.000]   this is the physical embodiment of Amazon Prime.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.520]   You can download stuff and watch it.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:51.240]   You can buy stuff really easily.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:53.880]   And that's exactly what they should be doing.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.520]   So if you don't use Amazon, you don't
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.600]   want to one of these tablets.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.600]   But let's think about--
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:00.480]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:01.480]   Go ahead.
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:03.480]   This fits perfectly with--
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:05.160]   this sort of reinforces the difference
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:06.760]   between Amazon and Apple.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:09.360]   So Apple makes great hardware and then
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:12.080]   tries to convince you to use its crappy content services
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:13.720]   so that you'll buy hardware.
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:15.760]   Amazon is the exact opposite.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:16.760]   It doesn't give a crap out.
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.320]   You can never compete with Amazon on price
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:19.720]   because they don't care if they make money.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.640]   They don't care about it.
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:22.480]   And Apple has to make money on the hardware.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:24.320]   That's the thing it's going to make money on.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.320]   In fairness, Apple's content services
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.440]   are either crappy or overpriced.
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:31.360]   They have high quality overpriced content services.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:32.040]   Not either.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:33.640]   Apple TV.
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:35.120]   It's an anore.
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:35.640]   Not anore.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:37.720]   Take your pick.
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:42.400]   The Amazon video stuff works very well in my Android tablet.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:42.920]   Yes.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.800]   I've been downloading stuff that's quite well.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.640]   I buy stuff on Amazon streaming all the time.
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.000]   I like Apple.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.400]   Frankly, it's either that or Google Play
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:52.400]   unless the only place you get is Apple.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.200]   Have you seen Handagot?
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:55.120]   I started watching it.
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:55.560]   Wow.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:56.960]   It was a mind-blowing show.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.840]   It's kind of mind-blowing.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.240]   It's crazy.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.560]   Yeah.
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:00.320]   He is so great.
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:04.720]   Ron Perlman plays a judge who has a religious awakening
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:07.000]   after his son commits suicide and then
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.800]   goes on a vigilante spree to find the killer.
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:10.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:13.400]   And it takes place in a fictional town in Silicon Valley.
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:14.640]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:15.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.440]   I only saw the first one, but I liked it.
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:19.600]   I'm going to get a six-pack of tablets, I think.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:22.800]   And by the way, congratulations to Amazon 5 Emmy Awards
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:23.800]   for Transparent.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:24.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:24.960]   Yeah.
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.840]   Which is why they're celebrating.
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:28.200]   It's down to the number section.
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:28.800]   That's OK.
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:30.600]   We'll get to-- no, no, don't waste a number.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:31.320]   We--
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:32.320]   No, I got numbers.
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:33.000]   I got numbers.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:33.520]   I got numbers.
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:34.200]   I got numbers.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.560]   I signed a bunch of other deals, too, right?
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.120]   Did you see that?
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:42.560]   They launched-- they announced a bunch of deals
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:44.880]   with, I think, Louis CK.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:45.440]   Yes, exactly.
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:45.960]   That's right.
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:48.200]   It helps when you win an Emmy that kind of gives you
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:50.080]   some credibility, right?
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.360]   And also, on September 25th at 12 AM,
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.760]   they will have a sale.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:58.720]   Amazon Prime, normally $99 will be on sale for $67.
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:00.400]   Oh, everybody should run and get it.
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:01.520]   That's if you're not in it.
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:02.960]   Well, I guess if you didn't buy it on Amazon,
[02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:03.600]   it wouldn't be worth it.
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:05.000]   But boy, you get so much benefit from that.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:05.520]   Yeah.
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:05.960]   Yeah.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:06.480]   Chestock.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:07.280]   You really do.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:07.880]   You really do.
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:08.520]   It's phenomenal.
[02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:11.000]   Although--
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.800]   It's actually-- I was a little depressed last week,
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:15.520]   because it was-- so garbage night is Monday.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.760]   So it was this week, a couple of nights ago.
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.240]   And I'm breaking down boxes.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:26.160]   And from one week, Amazon boxes, I mean like a lot.
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:28.560]   I just-- it took me an hour.
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:30.760]   And we have a fairly big--
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:33.120]   I recycled-- so they're in the recycling bin.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.320]   But it's a big recycling bin.
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:35.720]   I was jamming them in towards here.
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.680]   They're guilty pleasure.
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:38.080]   Every time I order something, I'm like,
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:39.680]   I should go to another site and buy this.
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:42.200]   I feel like I've just ruined the environment just by being in.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:44.680]   There should be an option where you don't get a box.
[02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:46.480]   It just comes in a bag.
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:47.480]   They do have those--
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:49.680]   They have the low frustration packaging.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.880]   But I'm sorry, no matter what, they always over package.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:54.280]   And the boxes are always too big.
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.920]   You always will have it with the direct delivery,
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:56.800]   the same day delivery.
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.200]   I'm sure that's what they'll do.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.000]   We go for pairs.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.800]   I hope so.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.440]   Somebody's telling--
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.480]   With the drones, it'll just have a parachute.
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.560]   Humanless driving cars and--
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:07.800]   Well, it would make me happier.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.280]   Yeah.
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:10.160]   I feel guilty enough about throwing away the gadget,
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:11.520]   but at least I don't have to--
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:13.200]   Or leave the box on the porch and then
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:13.960]   when they drop something off--
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:14.560]   Oh, reuse it.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.120]   --like they take the box back down.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:16.680]   You should recycle.
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:17.280]   Not me.
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:19.960]   Why am I recycling your boxes, Amazon?
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:21.640]   Maybe the vision that the drone is going to come
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:24.360]   to your front door is that you're going to get a little call--
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:26.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:28.640]   And there'll be a command.
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.520]   Alexa, drop the package.
[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:33.520]   Drop it.
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:34.880]   Drop it.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:35.880]   Drop it.
[02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:36.360]   Let go.
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:36.720]   Let go.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:37.640]   Drop it.
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:39.640]   Drop it.
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:41.000]   Incidentally, those tablets you're getting,
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.640]   the first day of advertising is supported.
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:43.640]   You know that.
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:44.840]   No ad blockers on that one.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:45.360]   Nope.
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:45.880]   No.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:46.640]   Like installing one.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:48.600]   I never-- I have the ad supported Kindle Paper.
[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:49.760]   White doesn't bother me.
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:50.440]   You don't see the ad.
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:50.760]   No, no.
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:51.440]   It's good.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:53.560]   You made somebody really bugging you.
[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:54.560]   See, that's the thing.
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:58.000]   Everybody-- we all have ad blockers installed in our brains.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:58.520]   Right?
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:07:59.800]   We don't even see ads anymore.
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:00.800]   Yeah.
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:01.320]   Yeah.
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:02.800]   And it's a notification, not audio.
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:04.120]   That's turning it down won't help.
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:04.480]   Yeah, I know.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.000]   That's confusing as hell, by the way.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:06.320]   Apple.
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:07.240]   Thank you, Apple.
[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:09.640]   There's different kinds of sounds with different controls.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:10.640]   Who knew?
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:12.480]   Happy birthday to you.
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:14.840]   Happy birthday to you.
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:16.480]   Happy birthday, everybody.
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:17.160]   Sitting out there.
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:19.080]   I can sing this song now without any pay royalties
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:21.440]   to "Warner's Ship Hell Music."
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:23.600]   Happy birthday to you.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:26.360]   So you have the story on "Fortune."
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:30.480]   Happy birthday is now public domain, plainly.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:31.360]   It's not, though.
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:31.880]   Oh, crap.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:32.880]   It's going to get sued.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:33.320]   Wait a minute.
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:34.200]   What?
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.920]   Can you edit that out?
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.600]   It's not actually public domain.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:38.120]   Oh.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:40.880]   So all they found was that Warner does not
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:42.440]   hold a valid copyright.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:42.920]   Oh.
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:45.160]   So that's not to say someone might not
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:46.880]   have a valid copyright.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:47.840]   But let's face it.
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:50.360]   After it's been 100 and whatever years,
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.720]   the odds of someone actually arguing
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:55.560]   that spending the time to argue that they have a valid copyright
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:58.280]   is pretty slim to nail, I would say.
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:02.440]   Warner bought this copyright in 1988 from another company.
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.640]   And they've been making $2 million a year.
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:06.960]   But they cost him $25 million.
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:08.000]   Now here's the real question.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.040]   They have to pay back to people.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:15.840]   So the plaintiffs in this case are basically
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:18.160]   mounting a second case to argue that Warner should
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:20.040]   have to come up.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:20.560]   That's a million.
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:23.560]   So it was a filmmaker who intentionally used Happy
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.280]   Birthday, paid $1,500 in license fees.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.360]   The whole purpose of it was-- she was writing it.
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:31.520]   She did a documentary about this so she could sue him.
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:31.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:32.760]   So thank you.
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:35.080]   And this is all-- and actually, they used a lot of the evidence
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:36.040]   that came up.
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.280]   I mentioned that Georgetown University law professor,
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:42.320]   I think, who's mentioned in the piece,
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:47.840]   did a massive amount of research in 2008, I think it was.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:51.400]   And produced this paper, which I remember reading,
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:54.000]   was just mind-boggling the kind of effort
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.360]   he went to to track down what happened in the 1890s
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.000]   with these sisters who wrote this little song
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.960]   and then sang it to kindergarten kids, just fascinating.
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:05.840]   That story.
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:08.400]   Highly recommended Matthew's article, "Unfortunate,"
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.400]   because it follows the trail.
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:13.400]   And you're the only one who got it right that it's not public
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:16.160]   domain that is now an orphan work.
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:16.960]   Close enough.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:17.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.640]   Well, it seems highly unlikely that somebody's
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:22.360]   going to come along and sing, "No, I own it."
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:27.600]   And that means even if nobody does that,
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:30.400]   you can sing it with impunity until such time
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:31.960]   as somebody has the--
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:32.400]   Right.
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:34.880]   --says, oh, yeah, I own it.
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.120]   It just reinforces, though, how--
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:39.160]   if this had not happened, that song
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.880]   would have been in copyright protection until 2030.
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:42.360]   Yeah.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:43.120]   Because of--
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.160]   --this was originally registered in 1935.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:49.000]   Because of Mickey Mouse.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.560]   Does that-- so Mickey Mouse, as everybody knows,
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:58.280]   was created in 1927 while Disney stole him from another mouse
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:03.160]   that was created a year earlier, as was Disney's want,
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:05.200]   as soon as he makes a movie.
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.160]   Now we own Cinderella, baby.
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:08.080]   It's ours.
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:10.040]   Forget those brothers, Grimm.
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.640]   And they've been going-- every time
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:14.840]   that copyrighted Mickey Mouse was about to expire,
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:18.400]   they've gone to Congress with a bag of money and extended it.
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.600]   Last time they extended it, it was with the help of Sonny Bono.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.880]   It's called the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act.
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.720]   So that takes us to 2030, so we don't
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.040]   have to worry about it for a while.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:30.000]   Save your money.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.720]   Save your Mickey dollars, Disney.
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:37.000]   And the one thing that this decision does
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.600]   is it prevents us from being subjected to the custom,
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.280]   happy birthday songs that every restaurant has--
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:44.240]   Happy Happy Birthday.
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:45.960]   Happy to do it.
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.720]   Do they do that in Canada, too?
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:48.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:49.720]   Yeah.
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:54.800]   Yeah, every restaurant-- and movies, it's so stupid they
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:56.640]   sing for you, the jelly good fella.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:58.760]   Like anybody would actually sing that.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.240]   Just pay the $1,500 for crying out loud.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.240]   You're making a movie.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:07.280]   Have you gotten the Getty threatening letters?
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:08.440]   Have you gotten talking about--
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:08.920]   No.
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:09.400]   No.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:09.760]   Why?
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:10.760]   We missed out.
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:11.760]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:13.200]   I'm going to throw the red down.
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.960]   That Getty is now going after photos.
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:20.240]   And there's various cases about how to respond.
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:23.240]   So Getty Images is a stock image--
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:24.160]   You should use--
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:28.200]   One of the biggest stock image firms.
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:32.000]   And these say that what you're using a Getty image,
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.440]   but they have to prove you're using it.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.560]   Just Google Getty threatening letters.
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:37.560]   And the first link is an instructional article
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:38.480]   what to do with it.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:43.880]   By the one hour professor, Ron Stefansky.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:46.680]   But why would you get this letter if you didn't use an image?
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:48.680]   Well, there's one case I saw--
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:50.080]   again, this is third hand.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:50.760]   So who knows?
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:52.640]   One case I saw where somebody--
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.000]   somebody's blog, they'd gotten a handout
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.440]   photo from a publicist for something.
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:12:59.800]   Put that photo up.
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:02.160]   And then apparently, Getty had bought that collection and said,
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:03.800]   no, no, no.
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:04.760]   We owe that photo.
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:05.400]   That's legit.
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:06.720]   They own the photo.
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:08.360]   What's wrong with that?
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:10.640]   Because they were given the photo for purposes
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:11.840]   of published publication.
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:14.480]   So then after the fact years later, we're told, no, no, no.
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:16.280]   We're not-- not only do you have to take it down,
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:17.280]   we're going to go after you.
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:19.200]   They're saying it's retroactive.
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:19.400]   Yeah.
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:20.360]   Hey, wait a minute.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:22.920]   Hey, Lisa, do we ever get--
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:24.000]   I think we did get a--
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.280]   I think we paid it.
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:26.640]   Really?
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:29.760]   I think we did.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.200]   Yes, it was for the Tech Guy Labs website.
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:37.520]   One of our editors had used an image.
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.880]   Can't remember the provenance, but we got a letter from Getty
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.080]   and we just paid it.
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:42.720]   It wasn't that much.
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:44.480]   It's like 600 bucks, 500 bucks.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:47.520]   Right, but this is like copyright trolling.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:50.680]   So they may not actually own that.
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:51.640]   I was suspicious--
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:52.320]   I don't know the idea.
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:54.640]   I was suspicious when I first saw it.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:56.640]   But what we did is we searched the Getty site
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:57.960]   and we found it.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:59.480]   But what you're saying is it may well
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:04.040]   have been legitimate use, but retroactively copyright.
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:05.120]   They're at the proper courses.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:06.480]   We know that the system of trying to find
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:08.680]   Providence on photos is not possible.
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:15.360]   And somebody can put it up on a sharing service
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:17.080]   and mark the licenses for reuse.
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:19.600]   And you try to be the good citizen and use it.
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:20.520]   Do they have the Providence?
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.360]   I don't know.
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.200]   Well, ever since we have made sure
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:27.640]   that we only use licensed stuff from Shutterstock.
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:31.560]   So I guess Lisa is not around because I'm pretty sure we just
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:32.280]   paid it.
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:33.520]   And we said, don't do that again.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:35.920]   Here's your Shutterstock license.
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:37.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:38.160]   Let's take a break.
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:39.040]   We come back.
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.760]   Numbers, tips, and all of that.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:42.200]   We'll wrap this puppy up.
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:43.960]   Can I throw one in before that?
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:43.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.560]   Just a little note.
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:49.080]   Neil McGrass Tyson interviewed Edward Snowden.
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.240]   Yes, I saw that.
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:51.920]   I did.
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:55.360]   And a fascinating little thing is that Snowden's argument
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.520]   was that we may not be able to find aliens
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:03.000]   because there's an inevitability, he says, to encryption.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.480]   You start with open communication.
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.440]   At some point, you're going to shut it down.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:09.520]   And the best encryption is indistinguishable from noise.
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:11.680]   So the noise we're hearing from outer space
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:13.840]   could be aliens we won't know.
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:15.080]   And vice versa.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.840]   Yeah.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:17.320]   We just--
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:19.920]   That space noise that we hear could be containing data.
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:21.680]   But we'd never know because it's encrypted.
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:23.680]   Could be porn.
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:25.120]   Might be worth trying to be encrypted.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.600]   I think alien porn might never be.
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:28.040]   Alien porn.
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:29.920]   Did you see there was a video up this week?
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:32.600]   I forget Mashmore or somebody showed people, just
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:35.800]   nice, durable people in the park.
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:37.520]   Porn VR elements.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:38.520]   Like porn.
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:39.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:40.680]   People were going, that's for it.
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:41.280]   Absolutely.
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.800]   When I saw that video, I thought, OK, this is going to be--
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:44.320]   I have to.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:45.320]   This is a huge one.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:45.820]   I know.
[02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:46.320]   Thanks.
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:49.440]   No, thanks.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.000]   The show.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.040]   Is there a card--
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.720]   Is there any cardboard porn?
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:53.720]   Yeah.
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:55.040]   Or is it on cardboard?
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:56.160]   Yeah.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.240]   Problem with cardboard is you need two hands to hold it,
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:00.360]   like that.
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:03.840]   So I have the gear VR, which straps under your head,
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:06.720]   leaving your hands free.
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:07.840]   Well, that's a bad visual.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:08.360]   I know.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.360]   Is that the ad?
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:10.120]   Is this the ad?
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:11.120]   No.
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:12.120]   OK.
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:13.120]   You can do it before I try it out.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:16.200]   No, I-- as an exercise, because I did think--
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.800]   I mean, it's-- I mean, nobody talks about this.
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:21.240]   But clearly, this could be a very big market.
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:24.360]   And I noted that a number of well-known porn publishing
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:26.760]   companies were already doing VR porn.
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:28.000]   It's not very well done.
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.320]   It's not very well done.
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:30.120]   Well, you've seen it too.
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:30.960]   No, no, no.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.280]   I saw the video that was referenced,
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:34.040]   where they show people in the park experiencing it
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:35.160]   for the first time.
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:38.280]   And the thing that everybody was surprised about
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:41.600]   is that in this VR version of porn,
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:42.880]   you're one of the people.
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:43.880]   Yes.
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:45.320]   Well, it's point of view.
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:50.520]   There's a person having relations with another person.
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:54.160]   And where that person's head would be is your camera.
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:57.960]   So it's as if it's a point of view.
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:00.280]   It turns out that's kind of not that great.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.040]   And then where they're shooting it,
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:03.480]   they need better cameras.
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:06.320]   There's not really immersive.
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.680]   I'll stop writing it.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:09.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:10.640]   I'm not complaining.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:14.480]   I'm just saying they need to-- if they had that theta--
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:15.600]   I'm telling you they could do something.
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:17.120]   Yeah, where could that go?
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.400]   I am going to do a 360-degree video blog with--
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.200]   as soon as this theta comes, because I think that's
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:25.040]   just fascinating.
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:29.760]   And in fact, in December, we're going on the anthem of the seas,
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:32.680]   which is this insane high-tech cruise ship that was just
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:34.160]   launched by Royal Caribbean.
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:36.560]   Because you open the door with your iPhone.
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:38.240]   I mean, everything is technology.
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:40.680]   They have a robot bar, tender.
[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:41.320]   And also--
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:42.240]   Oh, that one, Romano.
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:42.680]   Yeah.
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:44.640]   Is that the one that has the--
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:47.200]   for the-- if you're in steerage, they give you the LCD
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:48.000]   screen of the--
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.160]   If you don't have a window, they put a high-def 4K screen
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:52.600]   out there.
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:55.160]   And you actually see-- and they have red cameras
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:58.760]   on the book deck shooting the water.
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:02.200]   They actually do a virtual balcony.
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:03.920]   So it looks like it's your balcony.
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:06.880]   And it looks very realistic.
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.280]   It's really kind of amazing.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.560]   So yeah, so anyway, that is where I'm going to bring the theta.
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.480]   And you're going to get 360-degree views.
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:17.240]   It'll make you sick as a dog.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:19.480]   You, if Peter, who's in.
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:20.160]   Yeah, I'll go on.
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:21.920]   I can't wait.
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:24.240]   I really can't wait to get this theta as.
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:26.600]   I hope the quality is decent, because you could post it now.
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:28.240]   And YouTube and Facebook.
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:28.960]   When are you expecting it?
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:29.920]   It's pretty soon, I think.
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:32.520]   I just-- actually, I'll check while I'm doing the ad.
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.160]   Well, as soon as--
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:34.360]   I thought I was 3.49.
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:35.320]   It's not that bad.
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:38.680]   I already-- I ordered it the minute I saw it was available.
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:41.320]   You know why Dicty Bartolo, our gizwiz,
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:44.400]   showed-- because he was at the event where they announced it.
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:46.640]   And they took him out in Times Square.
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:48.920]   It's incredible.
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:50.960]   You're looking around in Times Square.
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:52.320]   Yeah.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:53.560]   It's amazing.
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:56.000]   And if you put one of the VR helmets on,
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.160]   you literally are looking around.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:00.880]   Or you can watch it on YouTube or Facebook with your--
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:02.840]   that's not as good.
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:04.960]   Hey, let me tell you about ziprecruiter.com,
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:07.040]   and then we'll get our final words on the show.
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.120]   Ziprecruiter is a solution for a problem a lot of you
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:11.160]   have if you're hiring.
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:12.680]   Of course, hiring is the most important thing
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:13.600]   you do in a business.
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:14.800]   I am not kidding.
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:17.160]   The people you hire are going to form the character
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:19.720]   of that business as long as they work for you.
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:21.560]   It's important to hire the right people, people who
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:24.360]   get the job done, but people who support your culture,
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:25.360]   your ethos.
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:27.680]   And thank goodness we've got the internet,
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:31.120]   because job sites really do make it easier to reach a much
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:31.760]   larger audience.
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:33.240]   But which job site?
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:34.400]   Which one do you use?
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:37.200]   They're more than 100.
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.200]   And by the way, you wouldn't want to use 100, right?
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.520]   Because can you imagine getting phone calls from every Tom
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:44.120]   Dick and Harry and all the emails?
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:44.920]   I got a better idea.
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:45.640]   It's ziprecruiter.
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:46.200]   It's awesome.
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:49.360]   You do post to every job board, 100 plus job boards
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:50.480]   with a single click.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:53.920]   You also post to Twitter and Craigslist, all the social sites.
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:58.440]   You also get matched as soon as you use it with nearly 6 million
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:19:59.640]   current resumes.
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:02.640]   So within a day, you're going to start getting applicants
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:03.520]   and good applicants.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:04.360]   But here's the deal.
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:05.960]   You don't have to answer a phone call.
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:07.120]   You don't have to answer an email.
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:09.960]   It all rolls into the ziprecruiter interface,
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:11.520]   where you can quickly rank them, rate them,
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:13.040]   and hire the right person fast.
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:14.760]   It's really nice.
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:15.920]   Really nice.
[02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:18.240]   We've used it here and been very happy.
[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:21.360]   Ziprecruiter, 400,000 businesses have used a ziprecruiter.
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.240]   Got an email from Lisa.
[02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:23.880]   Not my Lisa.
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:25.480]   Another Lisa said, I'm a business owner.
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:27.920]   I'm a novice when it comes to navigating job boards
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:30.400]   and searching for qualified candidates for my company.
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:33.800]   This morning, another near catastrophe that I avoided,
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:36.960]   thanks to a customer service agent by the name of Jed
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.200]   at ziprecruiter.
[02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:40.000]   He not only helped me out, but he went above and beyond
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.160]   to make sure I was satisfied.
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.240]   For that, I am grateful.
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:46.040]   And I would recommend Ziprecruiter to anyone.
[02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:47.560]   Great customer service.
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:49.520]   A really incredible product.
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:51.920]   And you can try it right now free for the first four days.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:54.680]   At ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:58.840]   Ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:00.680]   If you're doing the hiring,
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.720]   you owe it to yourself to use the best tool out there,
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:07.520]   ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:09.640]   Matt, you got anything you want to share with us?
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:14.040]   An idea, a tip of demo?
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:16.320]   Yeah, I was trying to think of something that I don't
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:18.680]   have any of the cool stuff that you guys have,
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:22.600]   but mostly because none of it works in Canada.
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:26.400]   I know you've got a box and play the guitar,
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:27.400]   and that's about it for any time.
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:28.840]   They have those great accents.
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:30.800]   OK.
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:32.840]   But have I mentioned Air Droid before?
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.120]   I can't remember.
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:36.400]   No, I know what it is, and I love it.
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:39.720]   Maybe there's a better tool, but I found it when I was trying
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:43.920]   to get something off my Nexus.
[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:48.040]   And I was looking for an easy way to connect the Nexus
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:49.120]   to the computer.
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.120]   Air Droid, it actually just keeps getting better.
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:54.240]   They added a whole bunch of new features.
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:58.800]   So you log in at web.air droid.com,
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:00.680]   and basically get access to your phone.
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:02.760]   And you can move files around.
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:08.120]   You can get instant messages on your desktop
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:09.680]   that have shown up on your phone.
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.280]   So if you leave your phone somewhere else,
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:15.080]   you don't want to miss a text message.
[02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:17.280]   I've used it for a whole bunch of different things.
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:19.000]   I haven't seen it written about a lot,
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.080]   but it's a great tool, at least I find it,
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:25.360]   for sort of getting access to stuff on your phone easily
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:26.560]   from your desktop.
[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:28.000]   I've used it for years.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.160]   You know there's no wires.
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:29.960]   It uses Wi-Fi.
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:30.400]   It's great.
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:31.080]   I love Air Droid.
[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:32.680]   Yeah, and it just works.
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:33.440]   It's free, right?
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:34.040]   I've never paid.
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:35.720]   Oh, I guess they have a premium version now,
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:37.480]   but I've never paid for it.
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:38.160]   Yeah, maybe there.
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:40.400]   Yeah, it's nice.
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:46.240]   AirDroid, airdroid.com.
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:49.240]   And now Jeff Jarvis has the latest numbers.
[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:50.920]   OK, we'll do a number.
[02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:54.440]   I'll do quick.
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:55.160]   Two real quick.
[02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:58.320]   One is we should note that Instagram hit 400 billion.
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:22:59.840]   Yeah, that's nice.
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:02.920]   I still love Instagram.
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:04.400]   And people laughed.
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:05.400]   It's not when he bought it.
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:07.400]   And there's pictures on Facebook.
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:08.040]   Amazingly.
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:09.200]   A million more.
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:09.720]   Yeah.
[02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:12.080]   Yeah, that was a deal after the WhatsApp sale.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:14.120]   Everybody realized that Billions nothing.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:15.560]   Ben Thompson and I were talking about it.
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:18.160]   He mentioned that he thought that was one of the best tech
[02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.720]   acquisitions of all time.
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:20.440]   Interesting.
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:21.360]   Yeah.
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:22.760]   Now, Ben says that's pretty good.
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:25.080]   The other number just mentioned is related
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.040]   to our earlier discussion about what happens to advertising.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:33.880]   E-Marketer says that the social advertising spend hit 25.1
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:35.520]   billion this year.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:38.040]   Facebook gets 16.3 billion of that.
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:39.920]   And Michael Tukman, that's usually your point.
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:41.960]   The law of this money is going to go away anyway
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:45.280]   from what we now consider advertising toward what we think
[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:46.720]   of as social.
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:48.520]   And podcasts.
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:49.720]   Just throw that in.
[02:23:49.720 --> 02:23:51.200]   Right.
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:51.520]   Yes.
[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:53.160]   I want to point out to anybody who's
[02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:54.400]   trying to reach it.
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:56.720]   Intelligent geek audience, there's nothing better than an ad
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:57.160]   onto it.
[02:23:57.160 --> 02:23:58.880]   And it can't be blocked.
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:01.280]   That's right.
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:03.080]   Say Matt there.
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:05.120]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:07.880]   What's your pick of the week, Mr. Mike Elgin?
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:11.960]   Well, I want to recommend an app called Instant.
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:15.280]   Now, there are a bunch of trackers for lots of different things,
[02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:19.200]   including quantified self-things for your physical activity.
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:21.480]   There are other trackers that keep track of where you go.
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:22.160]   This looks good.
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:24.040]   This single app tracks it all.
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:28.560]   And so it'll track how long you're at work, how long you're at home,
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:31.600]   how many minutes a day you spend on Instagram or Facebook
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:33.320]   or WhatsApp or whatever.
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:35.520]   It tracks how much you've run, how much you've walked,
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:38.640]   how much you spend in a car driving, everything.
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:40.600]   Just you turn it on and it tracks everything.
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:43.400]   And with one app, you can delete all the other apps.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:46.400]   And with this one app, you can just sort of track what you do.
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:49.080]   It quantifies everything that can be quantified.
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:52.960]   Is it-- where do I-- how do I-- what-- it goes on your phone?
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:54.320]   It goes on your Android phone.
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:55.280]   How do I know?
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:57.480]   But you go to instantapp.today.
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:25:00.160]   You'd have to put it on everything, right?
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:02.320]   Well, you can-- no, you just put it on your phone
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:03.800]   and it keeps track.
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:05.160]   There's also a Mac version for the--
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:07.360]   Well, yeah, because if you want to know what apps you've used
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:08.360]   and everything, you have to put on everything
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:09.480]   that you would use.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:12.840]   They also have a brand new iOS version and a Blackberry 10
[02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:13.560]   version.
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.320]   But this, on an Android device, is a great way
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.320]   to just keep track of where you go, how much exercise you get,
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:23.160]   how much time you spend doing this, that, and the other thing.
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:24.440]   It's fun to just let it go.
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:27.040]   And I love these that-- you don't have to launch it.
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:28.840]   You just launch it once.
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:31.200]   And then when you get curious when you want to know something,
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:32.040]   then you go--
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:34.000]   It's watching you all the time.
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:34.840]   That's right.
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:36.600]   You can surveil yourself.
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:37.360]   Go surveil yourself.
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:39.800]   Some in-app purchases it looks like.
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.240]   I don't know what those would be, but I like this idea.
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:44.920]   Yeah, that's a nice interface, too.
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:46.040]   Yeah.
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.880]   Because your phone really is a fitness tracker.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:50.600]   It actually does a very good job, as long as you keep it on you.
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:51.560]   Yeah.
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.240]   Folks, I think we're going to wrap this up.
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:56.200]   I thank Jeff Jarvis for making the effort to get here on time.
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:57.320]   We appreciate it.
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:25:59.520]   He's now on FaceTime, I think.
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:00.520]   Well, right.
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:01.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.760]   My phone is getting crashed, so now I'm on my Nexus 7.
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:04.260]   Nice.
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:04.760]   That's cool.
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:05.760]   I don't care.
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:08.440]   Buzzmachine.com, follow him on Google+, and of course,
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:11.600]   read his great books, the latest of which is Geek Sparing
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:13.560]   GIFs, and it's on Amazon.
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.000]   As always, books I just search for this.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:15.840]   Out in German.
[02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:16.920]   Out in German now.
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:19.000]   And you pronounce that?
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.760]   I don't know how they came over the new title.
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:21.960]   I appreciate it.
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:23.080]   OK.
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:24.120]   Jeff, we'll see you next week.
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:24.760]   Thank you.
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:26.880]   Have fun at ONA.
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:27.840]   Thanks to Matthew Ingram.
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:29.040]   He's from Fortune.com.
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:31.600]   We love Matthew and his canoes.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:32.840]   And I'm always glad to have you on.
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:33.960]   Have a great afternoon.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:35.720]   I appreciate your being here.
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:36.400]   Thanks for having me.
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.040]   All right.
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:37.560]   Take care.
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:38.840]   And Mike Elgin, our news director.
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:41.000]   You can see him Monday through Friday.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:45.400]   On TNT Tech News today, 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time,
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:47.760]   1700 UTC.
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:48.240]   That's right.
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:49.960]   And we'll be back Thursday.
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:51.400]   I'll be back tomorrow.
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:54.600]   Tomorrow morning at 10 AM for the Oculus event.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:55.200]   That's tomorrow?
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:56.880]   Tomorrow.
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.840]   No, it's Thursday.
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:26:59.880]   Tomorrow's Thursday.
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:00.920]   What day is tomorrow?
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:01.480]   Thursday.
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:02.400]   Oh, tomorrow.
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:04.080]   Yes.
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:06.880]   This is an actual reality, not just virtual reality.
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:08.720]   Is this real reality?
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:10.320]   Tomorrow, 10 AM will be doing it.
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:11.080]   I'll be there for that.
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:11.840]   Yes.
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:13.440]   And we have great guests as well.
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:15.200]   Oculus Rift, big event.
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:16.320]   Huh?
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:17.400]   Is this real life?
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:17.960]   I don't know.
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:19.400]   I'm confused.
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:20.400]   This is Wednesday.
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:21.560]   Then I better get out of here.
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:22.040]   Thanks a lot.
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:22.760]   I'm Leo LaPort.
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:23.680]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:25.120]   We'll see you next time.
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:25.920]   This week at Google.
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:26.920]   Bye-bye.
