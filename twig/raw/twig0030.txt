[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.120]   This is Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.880]   Episode 30 for February 21, 2010, the Scoble Effect.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.760]   This week in Google is brought to you by Go to Meeting.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.400]   Picture yourself on a phone call sharing and explaining
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.000]   something visual with Go to Meeting.

[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.080]   It's time for Twig this week in Google,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.000]   with the panelists here gathered today to talk about Google
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.920]   and the cloud, but really the way Google's on a roll.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.720]   I think it's going to be mostly Google.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.280]   Starting in the upper left-hand corner,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.200]   Googler himself, Matt Cutz from--
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.800]   Good to be here.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.320]   Thank you.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.600]   --cutts.com.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800]   Matt works on the website at Google Blocking Web Spam.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.160]   And I actually have a question for you that was raised,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.160]   I think on Twit last week.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.600]   But we'll talk about it about--
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.720]   well, maybe it was on this show about this new form of journalism.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.160]   We'll talk about it in a second.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.560]   But let me introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.040]   Also with us, Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachine.com,
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.840]   journalist, professor of journalism,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.720]   and the author of the book, What Would Google Do?
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.160]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.800]   Professor always makes me feel so old.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.280]   Professor Jarvis, calling Professor Jarvis.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.640]   The fact that I look at two doesn't help.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.000]   Oh, we're all--
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.160]   --prevert surely gray.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.760]   Exactly.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.800]   You're a young, young man.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.080]   Also here, I'm glad to see Anil Dash is with us
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.880]   from Expert Labs.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.480]   Hi, Anil.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.480]   Hello.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.840]   Good to have you.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.000]   Great to have you back.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.880]   Now, are you still at 6-part as well, or is Expert Labs?
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.080]   No, no.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.640]   I'd love 6-part a little while ago
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.040]   to do this Expert Labs project.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.960]   We're going to talk about that in just a second,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.800]   because you're newest--
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.160]   I don't want to say higher, but your newest person
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.520]   is Gina Tarpani from cleatwaveguide.com.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.680]   It's the founder of Life Hacker, star--
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.080]   So happy back.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.000]   --O magazine.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.200]   Yeah, sorry about your grandpa.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.720]   So happy back.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.920]   Grandpa, and I'm glad you're back.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.440]   Thank you.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.120]   Yes, I was having serious twig withdrawal.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.600]   Oh, well, yeah.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640]   Poor Gina missed the Buzz episode.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.840]   Oh, it was killing me.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.720]   I listened to it, of course, this week on my phone.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.120]   And I was just-- I was yelling at you guys in my car.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.720]   Now you know how the listeners feel, Gina.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.920]   What do we get wrong, Gina?
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.240]   What do we get wrong?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.600]   No, no, it was awesome.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   It was a great show.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.520]   But I was yelling about agreeing and disagreeing.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.360]   I was thinking about all the things I would have said.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.560]   So hopefully we'll get to recap a little.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.200]   Yeah, I think we're going to talk a lot about Buzz.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.080]   But there's also-- Google has been so busy.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.480]   But before we do that, a couple of days ago,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.320]   I saw a tweet from Anil Dash and then an article.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.520]   You've gone to work for expert labs.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.120]   First, Anil, tell us what expert labs is,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.600]   and then tell us what Gina's going to be up to.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.920]   Sure.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   The lofty description of expert labs
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.640]   is that our job is to help policymakers
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.040]   make better decisions by giving them the tools
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.000]   and the technology to crowdsource questions.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.360]   The practical part of it is-- and the reason
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.960]   that we brought Gina on board--
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.680]   is we're going to make a technology platform that
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.520]   lets folks from the White House to all the other government
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.040]   agencies do what all of us take for granted.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.400]   If you're looking to buy a new phone,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.640]   you can ask on Twitter or on front feed for 100 people
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.040]   to give you feedback about what phone you should get.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.720]   Well, the president should be able to do the same thing.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.560]   And the president would have somebody.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.600]   But I guess--
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   But you want-- Tech experts--
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.200]   They don't have the tools.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.480]   They don't have a good tool, right?
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   Fortunately, Gina's been building something
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.920]   like that with her think tank app.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.360]   And so we're able to sponsor that.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.120]   And the great thing about it is we're not a government agency.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.160]   We don't work for the government.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.280]   And so one of the things we could demonstrate
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.520]   is you can be a hacker and you can be a coder,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.880]   and you don't have to work for the government
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.760]   to work for your country.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.840]   And that's a pretty exciting idea.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.040]   I like that.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.840]   Nobody in the world is better than Gina to do it.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.440]   So Gina, what are you going to be doing?
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.200]   So I'm the project director of think tank, which
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.680]   is this open source project, which I've talked about on the show
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.180]   before.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.200]   It used to be called Twittelitic.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   This is my Twitter archive and data crawler.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.520]   Yeah, so I've been working on this kind of nights and weekends
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.200]   for almost a year now.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.680]   But we changed the name because we're
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.440]   going to incorporate information for more services
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   than just Twitter.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.680]   And it's up on GitHub.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.080]   It's free for anyone to download and try out and contribute.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.320]   Please, please, please.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.000]   I need good PHP programmers to help me out.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.560]   And yeah, I'm really excited.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   So I'm coding and figuring out ways to make it pluggable
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.440]   so we can add other services like Buzz and blogs.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.640]   And to just be able to have a place
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.320]   to collect your interactions on these social networks
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.280]   and make decisions based on the replies you get.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.680]   I was saying to a Neil last night,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.520]   it's like companies like Facebook and Google
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.360]   can collect all sorts of information about you
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.280]   to advertise to you really well.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.960]   Well, I think that you should have the right to collect
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.360]   your own data, the data from your friends as well,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.960]   to use for your own purposes.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.040]   So hopefully, Think Tank's going to help do that
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   in a little way.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.640]   And the most amazing thing here is the first customer
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.000]   for it is the White House.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.600]   They've got a project called Grand Challenges, which
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.800]   is trying to find the big scientific technology challenges
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.080]   facing the country, whether that's
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.440]   the next moon landing or the next human genome sequence.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.480]   And they want it--
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.400]   the public at large to be submitting their ideas
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   as to what those challenges are going to be
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.720]   and the platform that's going to power
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.120]   to think tank, which is just incredibly exciting.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.360]   That's really neat.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.160]   Wow.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.440]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.680]   You guys, the challenge obviously so far in the government
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.840]   trying to use my Starbucks idea, Dell idea store,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.320]   and kind of ideas platform, was that it got
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.440]   gamed by the marijuana crowd so quickly
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.520]   and everything's capable.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.760]   How do you get to the right people?
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.080]   How do you get to the quality of discussion?
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.960]   What's the way you're going to have to have this more
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.080]   qualitative view of discussion?
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   The goal is--
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.560]   Kind of for a stab in that maybe, Gina,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.480]   you can do the real answer with technology.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.280]   But I was going to say, to some degree,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.520]   there's going to be people saying
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.960]   legalized pot on any question.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.080]   Well, I'm not against that, but it was game to buy that.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.840]   So the problem is the whole thing kind of gets dismissed.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.080]   Because oh, yeah, just stupid stuff is just pot
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.240]   and there are good ideas in there that need to bubble up.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.720]   Right.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.160]   And philosophically, we're not building a voting system.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.120]   So we're not saying a policy maker
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.000]   has to go with whatever gets the most votes.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.760]   And that's how they choose the policy.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.160]   If they're trying to find out what a big scientific challenge
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.360]   is going to be and a bunch of people say, well,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   the challenge is what can we do with hemp?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.880]   What they can do is they can say, I hear you.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.160]   I see that there's a bunch of responses there.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.080]   We take that in good faith and we put that there
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.520]   with a number next to it and say, how many people felt that way.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.600]   But that doesn't mean we're subservient to that vote count.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.800]   Right.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.320]   No, no, no.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.200]   So then you have one of the next thing.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.840]   So it's really about--
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.640]   we assume policymakers have good judgment.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.960]   And we think so much about these contentious issues
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.920]   or the silly distractions of whoever
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.840]   has an axe to grind about some minor issue.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.680]   But reality is most of policy making
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.200]   is actually really pragmatic practical stuff that
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.040]   is common sense.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.080]   And they just need more info to make decisions.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.480]   I don't know, Gene, if you have more to add than that.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.680]   Well, I mean, on the tech side, in the web application
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.480]   itself, my plan is to make a long list of thousands
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.880]   of replies, something that's very easily filtered and curated
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.080]   by the people who want to put that data to use.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.600]   So imagine kind of like an iTunes smart playlist
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.320]   interface for the replies.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.640]   You can say, OK, roll up all the responses about marijuana.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.720]   We acknowledge these.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.920]   And we're going to put these here.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.880]   And we're going to put the total and make all those sort
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.280]   of filtering rules transparent.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.360]   So everyone sees how were these replies ranked
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.280]   and filtered and curated.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.000]   And to use lists, so expert labs is part of AAAS,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.120]   which is the world's largest scientific organization.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.240]   If we have a list of member scientists who we know
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.640]   are affiliated with the organization,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.480]   we know that the answers are coming from people who
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.200]   at least identified with that organization.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.400]   So one more here.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.880]   Because Buzz is better with discussion, with conversation.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.000]   Is Buzz potentially a better tool for you than Twitter?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.240]   Yeah, I mean, possibly.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.280]   I mean, I think Buzz is definitely one of the services
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.080]   that we want to plug into Think Tank.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.320]   Definitely, the behavior is different, obviously,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.160]   on Twitter and Buzz.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.280]   And Buzz, people respond to one another in line.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.200]   We're on Twitter because you don't
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.480]   have threaded conversations.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.120]   You just get this big massive replies.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.800]   And people don't see the replies that other people
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.320]   have posted in response to a single tweet.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.920]   So yeah, I mean, Buzz does offer that kind of back and forth.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.360]   But Twitter can be used as well.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.440]   I mean, if the platform is able to reply back
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.960]   to all the people who asked about a certain issue
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.800]   and engages them in further conversation, which is something
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   I'd like to do, then you can have
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.080]   kind of that similar thing.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.120]   Although Buzz displays those conversations,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.800]   those back and forths, by default, much more clearly.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.400]   Yeah, and I think the technology hopefully
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.680]   works with all these systems, right?
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.280]   All of the above is the best answer.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.080]   And I think one of the great things about this
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.040]   is if we build a system that connects to all these,
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.640]   if Think Tank gets plugins to support all these networks,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.280]   we start to see what each of the networks is good at.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.440]   That's actually a pretty interesting learning, too.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.040]   We have a grant from the MacArthur Foundation.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.400]   We're putting this part of the American Association
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.440]   of the Management and Science.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.680]   The mindset in both of those organizations
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.800]   is just publish your findings.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.880]   Tell us what you've learned.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.600]   And if one of the things we learned is this network's good
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.080]   for this kind of conversation,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.600]   and this other one is better for this other kind
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.240]   of conversation, here's what Twitter's better at
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.640]   versus Buzz and Vice versa, that's pretty cool to learn, too.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.720]   - It also brings in the scientific culture
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   of problem solving, which we need in government.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.000]   - Yeah, very much so.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.360]   - You're at AAAS right now, right?
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.480]   They're both of you.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.320]   - Yes.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.160]   - That's neat.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.000]   - That's exciting.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.840]   - Meeting, we're both here.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.680]   - Gene is always here in San Diego, but I'm down here.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.800]   I mean, it's mind-blowing.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.680]   Last night, we got to go to this reception
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.640]   to meet some of the folks here,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.400]   and there were three Nobel Prize winners in the room,
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.360]   and you just feel like the kid at the grown-ups table is.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.320]   It's pretty amazing that being a geek
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.720]   can get you access to that kind of thing.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.920]   - Expertlabs.org, not.com.org.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.760]   - That's right.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.000]   - And you can follow it at Expert Labs on Twitter
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.920]   and see what's going on.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.360]   I think that's really, really, really exciting.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.440]   So, Gina, you didn't get to talk about BuzzMac cuts.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.280]   You didn't either.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.080]   Actually, let me have a question for you first, Matt.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.000]   I know your job at Google is anti-spam,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.320]   kind of people trying to game the Google results.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.920]   Do you work on spam in Buzz as well,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.520]   or is that a separate kind of a business?
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.320]   - We haven't historically.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.000]   There is a central group that takes care of spam
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.080]   within Google that's not web spam,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.080]   and so typically that group is going to tackle it.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.640]   But the nice thing is that we do consult back and forth.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.480]   So I wouldn't be at all surprised if I see some spammers
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   to report it to them,
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.120]   and even sharing best practices on things like spam
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.880]   and Google Maps can be really, really helpful.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.760]   Sharing the same sorts of tools.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   So, I saw my first Google Buzz spammer a couple days ago,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.040]   so that adrenaline starts happening.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.120]   - It's a key feeling.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.960]   - I had to get them.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.840]   - Yeah, I block immediately when I see it,
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.800]   and I presume that by blocking, I'm kind of signaling,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   and there's also, I think there's a report spam button
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.920]   as there is on Gmail.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.760]   - Yeah.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.600]   - I'm loving Buzz.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.920]   I have to say I'm using it an awful lot.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.840]   I know you do too, Matt.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.280]   Gina, you've been using it a lot.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.640]   What did you want to tell us,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.240]   'cause you weren't here last week about Buzz, Gina?
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.440]   What were you yelling at the radio?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.880]   (laughing)
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.120]   - So this is the thing.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.160]   I like Buzz.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.320]   There are a lot of things I like about it.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.560]   I think there are a lot of problems with it.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.160]   I think there are a lot of ways that it can evolve
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.240]   and should evolve.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.680]   I do think that the fundamental mistake though,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.800]   with the launch, was launching it in Gmail.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   I understand that it got them a lot of users immediately,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.880]   but as far as I'm concerned,
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.480]   they needed to launch Buzz as a standalone beta product
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.640]   where people could very clearly opt in or opt out,
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.480]   and even if it was a really short beta period,
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.360]   like four to six weeks.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.960]   And just let the early adopters jump in
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.760]   and invite one another wave or Gmail originally.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.800]   And these privacy problems that happened
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.240]   would have surfaced a lot sooner
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.000]   and would have been a lot less severe.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.480]   And then at the end of the beta period,
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.720]   even if it's a short beta period,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.800]   even if it's a short testing period,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.880]   then bake it into Gmail.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.720]   It felt like, I think Yuri described it as a bold move.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   To me, it felt like a foolish one,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.640]   and it felt like a kind of like,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.640]   oh, we have to ship this,
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.200]   and we need to get 140 million users immediately.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.920]   And that felt, that was hard.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.680]   I mean, whatever, I'm not gonna rehash all the privacy stuff.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.120]   It was an alarming thing that Google decided
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.600]   to test this in-house with all new Google employees
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.240]   and not extended to their trusted tester program
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.200]   and just have it out in beta as sort of,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.480]   just a kind of test preview like wave thing first.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.680]   It felt like, I was like, did they have some sort?
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.520]   Were they late?
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.440]   Did they have some sort of ship date?
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.520]   Was there some kind of deadline
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.560]   that they had to push things ahead?
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.280]   I don't know, and I won't put Matt on the spot.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.000]   But that all said, and the privacy issues were very serious.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.280]   And what Eric Schmidt said about it made me very nervous.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.560]   Eric Schmidt makes me very nervous in general.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.400]   Really?
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.680]   Which one of what he said, you know?
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.120]   He makes me nervous.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   You know, well, the things he said about privacy before
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.960]   freaked me out, the old quote, which was, you know,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.640]   well, if you're doing something you shouldn't be doing,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.000]   you know, and maybe you shouldn't be doing it.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.240]   If you need that level of privacy,
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.280]   maybe you shouldn't be doing the thing you're doing.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.040]   And then I think this week he said, well,
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.360]   no one was hurt, which is true,
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.320]   you know, meaning the buzz privacy issues.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.360]   No one was hurt, which is true, but you know,
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   what our view would have liked if you were to-
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.080]   We don't even know that no one was hurt.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.720]   So it may not even be true.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   It may not even be true,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.160]   but what I really wanted to hear from him is what Todd said.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   I thought Todd Jackson, the product manager, G-mail,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.240]   I mean, the fact that he just came straight out and said,
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.640]   we are really sorry and we're working really hard.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.720]   And I have to say, I've been super impressed
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.560]   with Google's response to this.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.040]   I mean, I think that Google was becoming more and more human
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.800]   on the lower ranks anyway.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.040]   You know, you're getting a lot more communication
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.920]   and a lot, I mean, for him to come out and just say,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.360]   we really screwed up and we're trying to make it better.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.160]   And I have to tell you, I know that this was embarrassing
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.600]   and I don't think it's gonna happen again this way.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.320]   So that's good as learning experience.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.760]   But now the fact that Schmidt said,
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.240]   well, no one was hurt.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.160]   What I really wanted to hear from him was,
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.560]   we screwed up and we're sorry and we're fixing it.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.000]   And I guess that was part of the message as well.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.920]   But that all said, Buzz makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.080]   I agree with you, Leo, it makes a total lot of sense.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.880]   It's the missing puzzle piece, it ties together.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.160]   A lot of different services.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.280]   I like it.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.080]   It's still a little, some problems here and there.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.600]   Stuffer's a little bit from the friend feed.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.120]   Like this is too complicated, what's going on,
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.080]   what's all this stuff, how did people get this in here,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.480]   feeling, but otherwise, yeah, I'm liking it.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.720]   I mean, it's not Google Apps is my main Gmail account.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.000]   So I have to go to my regular Gmail account
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.840]   to see it right now.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.440]   So I haven't been using it as much as usual.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.760]   I mean, I connected my sites and that was it pretty much.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.440]   I'm using it more like a broadcast mechanism
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.840]   than a discussion forum right now.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.200]   But I think that'll change once I see it in apps.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.320]   - Matt, Matt, do you have anything you want to say?
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.160]   I don't want to.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.880]   I can mount a soft defense, which is, you know,
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.640]   I'll take your excited on a lot of stuff in that,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.560]   you know, I remember whenever I joined Google
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.480]   and the stock price was very, very low.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.760]   And I went home--
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.160]   - Or rub it in, why don't you, Matt?
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   (laughing)
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   - It's your main command.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.000]   - I wanted to.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.560]   - It's 518, Matt.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.400]   - It really does make sense.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.480]   I went home to my wife.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.360]   - Not your best sympathy building.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.040]   - Okay, you know, I joined it was $10 a share.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.880]   I don't know.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.240]   - Let me start that over again.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.560]   - So I remember whenever Eric Schmidt joined,
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.840]   he came to a TGIF and he answered questions for like an hour.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.000]   And I went home and I told my wife,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.200]   the value of our stock just went up by like a factor of 10
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.680]   because he was, he clearly got it.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.440]   And I think he absolutely does get it.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.920]   So, you know, last year, I think he was a little bit
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.240]   taken out of context because the question was,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.920]   can Google be your best friend?
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   And just the mere fact that any major financial news reporter
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.600]   can ask a large CEO corporation,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.840]   can your company be your best friend?
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.400]   That's in some sense a good thing.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.800]   And I think he had to answer in the fact
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.760]   that in his capacity as CEO,
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.760]   that said, all the people who don't like that answer,
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.480]   the Patriot Act is coming up for renewal in like March
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.120]   or February pretty soon.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.880]   So that's a good chance for people to start to say,
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.680]   well, I don't want things like the Patriot Act,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.440]   but taking it back to Buzz for just a second.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.520]   The thing that I found that is the most,
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.680]   the best indicator of whether a team
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.560]   is going to be successful, there's really a couple.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.760]   But the primary one is how fast they can iterate.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   The second one I would say is how well they listened
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.640]   to outside feedback.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.880]   And I think Todd Jackson and that entire team
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.000]   has done an amazing job of saying, okay, you know,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.920]   Google has gotten scalded on both sides.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.040]   They say, well, Gmail was in beta for five years, you know?
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.320]   And on the other hand, I take the point about launching
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.120]   with a little more testing.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.600]   And at the same time, if you can get it live,
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.480]   especially a social networking sort of product,
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.720]   if you can get that live where everyone can play with it,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.480]   it's not on an invite sort of basis pretty early on,
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.560]   then that lets you try out a lot of different things.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.680]   I'm already getting more reactions
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.840]   on some of my buzzes than on my blog.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.760]   I did a question like, well,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.120]   who do you guys use for your domain name registrar
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.800]   and got something like 120 comments in a day or so?
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.160]   - Which of us races the number one complaint people have,
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.320]   which is actually two, which is how do I collapse
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.840]   these damn comments?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.520]   And then how do I keep Matt cuts from rising
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.560]   the top of the page every day?
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   - Yes.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.000]   - Well, it's not, it's the scoble problem,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.960]   we should just call it that.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.800]   - Right.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.080]   - Yeah, let's not blame Matt for it,
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.040]   'cause frankly, I'm kinda party to that too.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.680]   - The only way I just saw in buzz
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.080]   while we were talking that Yuri put up a Google moderator page
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.400]   with suggestions on how to fix buzz and votes there,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.720]   it's a perfect use of Google moderator, I think.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.560]   - Yes.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.760]   - To become recursive here
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   in using the Google tool to fix Google
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.440]   and help provide that kind of input
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.480]   that Matt just talked about.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.440]   And so it's on, it's on the,
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.000]   it should be on the friend feed page momentarily.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.840]   - Right.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.320]   - Yeah, and it's pretty clear that the team's responsive,
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.560]   they immediately responded to the privacy issues
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.440]   and fixed that, I think fixed that,
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.520]   although Google is being sued,
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.000]   there's a class action lawsuit coming out of Florida.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.120]   - That's what drives me nuts,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.280]   the privacy advocates come out of the woodwork
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.960]   and go berserk.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.320]   And I just think we've gotta get over that.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.480]   And at some point, you don't wanna use buzz,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.360]   don't use buzz.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.440]   - Yeah, I'm kinda with you.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.160]   - Just don't use it.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   - But go ahead.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.600]   - But, hey, you've.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.240]   - It wasn't clear how to turn off,
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.400]   I mean, it really wasn't easy to see how to opt out of buzz.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.720]   I mean.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.000]   - But at some point, the immediate rush to sue
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.920]   and to claim that Google is ruining all of life
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.080]   and the internet has ruined everything,
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.520]   then fine, turn it off.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.360]   - Right.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.200]   - Sorry.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.120]   - No, I'm kinda with you.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.760]   - I do think the other side of it,
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.840]   when there's a new service,
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.720]   there should be a little bit of an internal checklist
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.560]   process on this.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.080]   And I think Matt, you and I have had this conversation
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.960]   where almost, I want people to see the Google dashboard
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.720]   of all their services on the way into the new service.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.040]   You know, so the first time it pops up and says,
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.760]   here's a new service you can try out.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.760]   It says, by the way, here's everything else
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.600]   that's connected to it.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.680]   - A lot of people didn't even know
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.840]   that Google dashboard existed.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.760]   So, I'm with you on that.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.560]   - Well, it was announced almost like a project, a product.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.600]   And then we forgot about it once it wasn't new anymore.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.960]   - Right, if you go to google.com/dashboard,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.600]   I think that's it.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.640]   And then you have to be logged into your account.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.480]   - That's it, right?
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.960]   I don't have a Yahoo dashboard.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.160]   I don't have a Windows Live dashboard.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   So it's a great thing, just let me see it more.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.400]   - Right.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.880]   - So it tells you what Google services you're using,
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.680]   what your logins are.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.960]   And if you go to the buzz section,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.400]   it tells you quite a bit.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.800]   In fact, somebody's complaining,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   "Oh, there's no way I could see what people have liked
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   or what they've commented on."
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.680]   And it actually gives you a link to all of that.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.440]   So you can see what people are saying
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.640]   and what their most recent posts are.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.480]   This is, is that visible to other people?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.120]   Or is that only visible to me like this most, my likes?
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.520]   That would be, that maybe something needs
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520]   to be exposed publicly.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.040]   - I don't know.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.480]   And yeah, I'm sure that the collapsing thing will happen.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.800]   And they've already fixed, they say that the Google Buzz Blog
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.720]   says we've kind of weighted against these noisy people
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.200]   rising to the top quite so fast.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.040]   - Yeah, if you can take care of the scoble problem
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.880]   and sort of--
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.120]   - I love it though, it's the scoble problem.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.560]   - He's such a corner case, you know?
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.000]   He's got so many thousands of people that follow him.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.120]   But if you can take care of that,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.600]   then suddenly things get a lot cleaner.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.120]   And the fact that they can do two or three pushes a week
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.080]   if they have to, means they can iterate
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.200]   according to that feedback, which is really helpful.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   - This is what I said actually last week,
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.840]   is that if Google maintains its commitment to this,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.640]   this should improve very rapidly
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.720]   and become very powerful.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.680]   And you have the network effect built in.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.200]   You know, so many sites like this start
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.720]   and can't immediately get enough people to make them useful,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.560]   that's built in.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.600]   I can understand why they launched in Gmail as bad as that was
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.840]   because you've got the network effect.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.080]   You're ready to go.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.880]   - Well, and I personally, the thing that a lot of people
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.480]   have mentioned is enterprise,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.880]   because we've been using it internally at Google for months.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.800]   And the fact that you can share articles
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.400]   just within your company and discuss it there
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.880]   and get feedback and have ideas,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.280]   brainstorm is a really useful way to use buzz.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.000]   - Matt, was everyone in Google using buzz?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.800]   - I don't know whether everyone was turned into the beta,
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.640]   but there was a large number of people.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.280]   - It's so incredible that a secret can be kept that way.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.280]   - I know.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.600]   Nobody knew about this.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.320]   It was like, I mean, even Erington didn't have this.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.880]   It was amazing.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.920]   Just came out of nowhere.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.480]   - It was impressive how many services it's plugged into.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.320]   - Yeah.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.120]   - You know, when I first saw it show up on mobile maps,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.760]   I mean, that was almost the first place I saw it.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.440]   That was pretty impressive.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.640]   - So,
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.200]   - Three cheers for APIs and Open Standards, definitely.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.520]   - Yes.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.200]   - We're very happy about that.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.920]   - It seems like they've intended from the beginning
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.040]   to be very open about getting the data in,
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.600]   taking the data out, getting RSS feeds of everything.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.720]   So, you know, that's the embrace that you want.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.560]   - Right.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.040]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   - All right, well enough about buzz.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   Unless anybody has anything else they want to say about buzz.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.880]   We're using buzz.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.640]   I'm actually, I think we're probably going to migrate
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.760]   from friend feed to buzz.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.160]   Although there's some features that we have,
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.680]   like the friend feed rooms that are really useful.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.640]   For instance, we pipe all the stories we're going to talk about
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.160]   into a room in friend feed where people can comment on
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.000]   and so forth.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.720]   And I don't quite have that yet.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.720]   But I imagine since this looks so much like friend feed,
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.640]   any feature that I had said from Fennfeed I'd like.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.280]   And how many of you follow Mashable and are going to stop
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.600]   because they just own the,
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.840]   we were talking about this, weren't we?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.200]   - I don't want to lose Mashable because it's so good.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.480]   And it's a good feed, but that's a success problem.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.800]   Google better figure out fast.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.520]   - Yeah, because Mashable always is on the top.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.120]   And because they're using it,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.600]   first of all, because they have 20,000 followers,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.880]   there's a lot of commenting going on,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.240]   but also they're using it as a news feed.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.440]   It's turning buzz into kind of into a news reader
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.480]   with commenting.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.360]   It's a little bit like Google Reader exposed into buzz.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.240]   The other thing that Yuri said in his blog post,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.840]   which I didn't really kind of highlight yesterday,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.200]   the last week that I should have was that this brings in,
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.880]   you know, a lot of things we've seen as we've been doing
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.840]   this show over the last year, like latitude,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.960]   a lot of these little launches,
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.160]   now I'll make a lot more sense.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.240]   The way the groups work in contacts,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.400]   oh, now I can use groups when I post,
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   I'll make more sense because we've got a context around it all.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.040]   I think it's working quite well.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.880]   - The business, and I don't think we've begun to see
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.040]   the impact this is gonna have on maps,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.480]   and thus on local and advertising.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.080]   - Yeah, I put the buzz layer on immediately on the maps
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.000]   in my phone.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Now let me ask you, Jeff,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.960]   because I'm getting the feeling you're liking your,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.400]   yeah, yeah, yeah, I've been making myself use it
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.960]   pretty much full time, and I carry both,
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.000]   belt and suspenders.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.400]   But no, I am liking the Android more and more,
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.360]   and I just downloaded some more apps today
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.480]   that may be happy that they were there,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.360]   like WordPress is there and other things
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.960]   that make me happy, so.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.280]   - I'm gonna talk about one that you tweeted
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   towards the end of the show,
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.720]   a visit from the guy who wrote it,
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.520]   Daniel Swick, and he saw your tweet saying
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.680]   how much he loved Google's shopper,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.640]   and he's gonna stop by and talk about it.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.760]   - Right.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.440]   - Just a forbid at the end of the show,
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.600]   he'll be available in a few minutes,
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.040]   and we'll get him on.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.480]   - Just a note, no developer wants to hear from a user,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.400]   I'm making myself use it.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.720]   (laughs)
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.320]   - I'm forcing myself to use this damn Nexus one.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.800]   - I've been making myself use it,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.840]   and it's not so bad.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.240]   - No, actually, no, Gina, the truth is,
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   you made me use it.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   - Yes.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.080]   - Blame Gina.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.440]   - When you say Gina, I listen to you.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.680]   - Blame Gina, it's her fault.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.520]   - Well, there's an interesting--
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.920]   - Or as Gina, as I say to my wife often,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.320]   you're right, honey.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.160]   - Yes, dear.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.000]   If you're in a minute--
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.520]   - It's a phone, not a treadmill, right?
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.680]   Like one being drinking.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.200]   (laughs)
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.440]   - I feel like it's more like a treadmill, go ahead.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.600]   - I loved that there was a couple posts by Jason
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.920]   Kate on TechCrunch and then Danny Sullivan.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.080]   And I think Jason said,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.040]   "You have to use Android for a while and get used to it."
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.240]   And Danny Sullivan replied,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.680]   "I didn't have to use the iPhone for a while
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.520]   to get used to it."
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.360]   - True.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.280]   - And there's an interesting point,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.600]   but I think with the iPhone,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.720]   I was using a dumb sort of feature phone before that,
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.120]   and the Delta was so huge,
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.280]   you were just, of course,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.920]   you're gonna switch to the iPhone.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.600]   And Android and the iPhone are different.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.720]   It does take a little more time to get used to
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.440]   the Android system,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.160]   especially if you've been using an iPhone,
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.400]   but then once you get used to it
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.720]   and you figure out all the different ways
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.280]   to get to the more information
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.920]   and some of the nice sort of open features
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.440]   where you can write your own apps for free,
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.560]   that sort of stuff,
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.240]   that's where it really starts to get addictive for me.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.600]   - Well, when people go for my dumb clamshell
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.000]   to an Android, they never have a problem, right?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.400]   It's the iPhone Android that's hard.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.080]   - Right, 'cause they want the iPhone capabilities, yeah.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.320]   - It's a totally different paradigm.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.040]   It's a different interface,
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.200]   and the iPhone to Android transition is definitely Rocky One,
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.480]   but the clamshell to Android,
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.240]   my brother got Android phone after having,
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.880]   you know, and he's like, I love it.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.440]   He has no idea what the iPhone does.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.080]   - He angels are singing.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.040]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.320]   - One thing that still gets me is that
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.960]   the need for that millisecond to think before I hit.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.320]   Now, what does the search button do in this case?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.400]   - Right.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.680]   - I hit that button and I got this at that time
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.320]   and that, you know, it's the soft key problem,
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.800]   which, fine, I'll get used to it.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.520]   - Have you guys had problems with the keyboard
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.360]   being either touchy or off, like the digitizers misplaced?
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.600]   It's just been a little funky.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.680]   It's hard for me to type on it compared to the iPhone.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.120]   - Just like Space Bar drives me nutty.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.560]   - Space Bar, you'll hit it by accident.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.400]   - I hit that all the time and it's just a little word
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.560]   that's like a... - I hit send all the...
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.080]   - When sometimes when I find that my touches
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.520]   are off a little bit, I just tap the off, like,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.040]   sleep it and then wake it again,
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.320]   and things seem to re-center, so.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.840]   - I also, I've been using task-tolerant.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.760]   - Oh, you like swipe?
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.120]   - That's a... - I'm gonna miss you.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   - You can just get the chat from two.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.960]   - Yeah.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.640]   - Yeah, I mean, I've been putting up with,
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.760]   keep popping this dialogue 'cause it's like an alpha, you know.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.120]   - SWIP. - SWIP.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.960]   - Yeah. - I can't just
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.600]   install that right, you have to do a fancy thing.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.960]   - No, no, no, you can install it.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.680]   You just have... - You go to a website
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.120]   to install it, like, it's not, I don't believe
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.600]   it's in the market. - It's not in the market.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.120]   - And it's a test build, so it keeps popping
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.800]   this dialogue saying like, we don't support
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.120]   this screen resolution, I deal with the dialogue
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.040]   all the time to just, I have to deal with dismissing
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.240]   the dialogue just to get the keyboard.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.360]   It's much better for me typing.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.200]   - I'm gonna say to their credit,
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.800]   it's interesting watching the Windows Phone thing
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.080]   come from Microsoft where they will probably avoid
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.600]   some of the comparison with iPhone that Android
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   has suffered from because it's such a different
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.400]   user experience model, it's much more data centric.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.240]   And so I think that was a pretty smart move
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.760]   because I think Android is similar enough to iPhone
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.160]   that you end up making those comparisons.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.800]   And it's like if you're coming out with a new phone,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.080]   the thing to do is to not be that close to iPhone
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.640]   so you don't suffer. - The Windows Mobile,
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.640]   and they call it Windows 7 Phone Series,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.000]   nicely named Microsoft.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.720]   - Windows Phone 7, I don't know.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.320]   - Windows Phone 7, anyway.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.640]   - It's terrible. - It's a little live
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.480]   in the name, come on.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.120]   - It's terrible, it's the worst Microsoft,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.640]   if there's one thing Microsoft does badly,
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.840]   it's come up with names, but anyway.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.680]   - That's not the only thing.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.000]   - Yeah, maybe there's two things.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.080]   Anyway. - Not a native English speaker
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.720]   who ever names. - Yeah, it's like what?
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.160]   But it also doesn't follow in sequence
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.400]   'cause it has been Windows Mobile and they just dropped it.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.080]   It's like no, it's not mobile anymore.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:46.920]   What?
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.600]   But anyway, it looks good.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.720]   Looks on paper, looks really good,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.760]   has a great social networking,
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.600]   it's based kind of on the Zoom, to be honest,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.200]   it's the Zoom paradigm.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.720]   But we won't see phones till the end of the year,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.960]   so it's not a player for a while.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.600]   - I just went to the swipe site by the way,
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.080]   and on the 15th they announced
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.920]   they got a million from Dokomo.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.480]   - Oh, the Japanese telecom.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.640]   - That they're launching on the T-Mobile MyTouch 3G on Feb10,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   so it's their first official,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.920]   get it on the phone launch.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.200]   - So the thing that just so you know,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.440]   if you go there that's different,
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.920]   is you don't tip, tip, tip, tap,
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.360]   you move your finger around and you spell the word by.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.760]   It kind of takes a little while to get used to,
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.200]   but it does seem more accurate, I have to say, Gina.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   - It's definitely more accurate.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.400]   I don't like touch,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.040]   I just haven't gotten used to the touch keyboard,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.880]   I never liked it.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.960]   I didn't like it on the iPhone either,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.000]   and that's why I got the G1
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.280]   'cause I really liked the physical keyboard,
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.720]   and I still struggled with the touch keyboard on the N1,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.960]   but now it's why you have to walk through the tutorial.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.720]   Like at first, there are a couple of tricks they have to know,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.280]   like if you're spelling the word good,
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.680]   and you need the O to show up twice,
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.880]   you twirl around on the O,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.720]   and it helps to double it up.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.480]   - I couldn't figure out how to double.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.680]   You go like this, you go,
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.520]   (grunts)
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520]   - Yeah, you twirl around,
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.760]   see the cross keyboard in the twirl, yeah.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.560]   But now I've gotten really good with it,
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.840]   and I can't back it up.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.800]   - I'm gonna put it back on,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.200]   I have it on here, I downloaded it,
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.800]   and it bugged me 'cause it's the pop-up bugged me.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.480]   - You turn it off, or off it will?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.800]   - Yes. - Or is, okay.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.640]   - Yeah, you can.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.560]   - The other thing that I've been doing
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.680]   is I've been using voice for search,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.920]   I haven't used it to post.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.760]   - I used it to search.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.600]   - I used it to search.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.440]   - Oh, it's so good.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.160]   - It occurred to me the other way, this way.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.640]   So we always, how many years did it take?
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.800]   We thought people looked like idiots
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.560]   walking down the street talking on their--
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.400]   - I'm always going.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.280]   - I'm doing all the time.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.120]   - There are times.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   - It's all day.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.760]   - And I do it, and I go,
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.760]   "I am now at the eye doctor, period."
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.200]   And it does very well if you talk like that,
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.480]   but you look like a weirdo.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.000]   - We're gonna see that with the straight girls soon.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.520]   - I think it's funny, as geeks,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.360]   we think it's a good thing when the software
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.320]   has trained us what to do with this device.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.160]   - Hey, as long as it works,
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.520]   I don't care if I have to jump through hoops,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.600]   just make it work.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.760]   - You know, give it five years,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.040]   and everybody will be doing that,
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.240]   it'll be the social norm,
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.200]   and if you see someone not talking into their phone,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.800]   you'll think they're kind of unusual or quirky.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.280]   - There'll be whole quiet cars on Amtrak
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.000]   where you're not allowed to use voice search.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.680]   - They already think I'm unusual or quirky.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.920]   Now, wait till you see me at South by Southwest,
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.760]   we built a rig, I'm gonna wear a helmet
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.800]   with a light and a camera on it.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   - You're coming!
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.640]   - You're coming!
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.000]   - Awesome, I'm gonna show you there.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.840]   - You're gonna show them.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.680]   - Finally, yeah, it's gonna be--
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.840]   - We've never met Gina.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.120]   - Yeah, I've never met in person.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   I know I feel like you're my internet dad,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.960]   and I've never met--
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.800]   - You ever met like a Leo?
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.640]   - Dad!
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.480]   Dad!
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.320]   - I found you!
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.640]   - That was really bad.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.480]   - That was cool.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.200]   - Uncle. - My internet president.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.600]   - Your uncle, maybe.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.440]   Dad!
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.280]   - My uncle, my uncle.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.600]   - No, I could be your dad, it's true, it's sad but true.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.360]   - Granddad, what do you say?
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.520]   - Grandfather, yeah.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.120]   So we're getting a helmet, a calling's built,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.760]   'cause I talked to Scoble and he said,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.480]   "Well, we wanted a cover," and he said,
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   "You can't, the sessions are all streamed,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.640]   "so there's nothing to cover there."
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.480]   And there's no like lobby con,
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.600]   because there's too many venues, I guess.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.360]   So there's nowhere to set up and say,
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.560]   "Oh, come over here."
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.400]   So they see--
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.160]   - Well, the whole thing is a lobby con.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.800]   - Well, he said-- - Why listen to Scoble?
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.480]   - Well, that was maybe my mistake.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.520]   He was trying to get me to dress up
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.000]   in a super-day Vase-born suit.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.840]   But anyway, so--
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.080]   - That guy ruined Buzz, I heard.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.160]   (laughing)
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.000]   - Oh, him!
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.440]   The guy who ruined Buzz!
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.920]   What am I talking to him for?
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   So he said, really, well, actually got experts here.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.200]   You tell me, 'cause I've never been.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.840]   He said, "It's about the parties."
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.960]   - I guess it's about just running into people you know.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.800]   - Well, that's--
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.080]   - You set up anywhere in the convention center.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.360]   - I'm not gonna set up.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.160]   I'm gonna have a remote rig in a backpack
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.200]   and a helmet camera and a helmet light,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.120]   and I'm gonna walk around.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:30.960]   - Well, you don't have to worry about it.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.520]   - And you also just plop down somewhere
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.760]   and you will see everybody.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.600]   - I might get tired.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.920]   - I mean, it's about the serendipitous running into people.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.400]   I wouldn't go so far as to say it's about the parties.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.240]   - Okay.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.960]   - But it is also probably not about the panels.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.800]   - Anyway, I think--
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.880]   - I can't take Jake to all the parties
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.200]   'cause some of it's illegal to do 'cause he's too young.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.040]   - Right.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.440]   So what we're gonna do is,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.320]   if you were me, it's gonna be a kinda telepresence.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.440]   If you were me at South by Southwest,
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.400]   this is what it would be like.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.000]   - Cool, I'll re-do our show from there, Leo.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.480]   - Yes, since you're all there, right?
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.600]   - Well, you gotta come to our kickball game.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.400]   We're gonna have a kickball game Saturday morning.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.800]   - Oh, I'm definitely coming to the kickball game.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.160]   - I think kickball game is awesome.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.000]   - I just wanna see if kickball is the helmet all
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.040]   and then the camera.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.680]   - Oh, that's a great idea.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.360]   - So now are you gonna be broadcasting live?
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.280]   - Yeah, well, I have to do the radio show from there.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.360]   So 11 to 2 Saturday, I'll do the radio show
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.800]   from our Austin affiliate,
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.000]   but they're gonna be broadcasting
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.600]   from South by Southwest on Sunday.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.640]   So Sunday I'll be doing the radio show live there.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.360]   We'll do a twig live, we'll find, I don't know.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.760]   You all, maybe we'll have to make helmets for you guys too.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.600]   We'll have to--
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.760]   - Oh, please, oh, please.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   - So think kick has these little $99 cameras
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.920]   that have pretty good sound
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   and record at 640 by 480.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.560]   - Yeah, exactly, but we don't wanna record it.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.280]   'Cause I'm wearing a backpack with a live streamer
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   and that you stream's gonna give us a live streamer.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.840]   So it uses, and I know there's no EVDO there,
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.720]   but it uses all four carriers at the same time,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.680]   hoping that one of them--
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.520]   - One problem is that AT&T was borked--
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.400]   - I know, I know.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.040]   So we, this is gonna have T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.560]   and Sprint all in one box.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.920]   - Jesus.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.080]   - You know, all the five lines--
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.560]   - Five lines, they had a camera mounted on a guy.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.400]   - Oh, we never had a backpack.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.040]   - Yeah, it's crazy, I don't know what I'm doing anyway.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.880]   Thanks for the--
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.600]   - People are tweeting the fact that I just called you
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.080]   my internet dad, and I feel bad.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.240]   Now I meant that as like the deepest compliment Leo.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.400]   - Oh, I know, I'm not hurting the least.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.240]   What do you think?
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.120]   You think I don't know that I'm an old guy?
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.640]   - Internet big brother.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.560]   - Big brother, my internet--
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.320]   - No, don't say that, that's worse.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.080]   - Well, that's kinda creepy.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.920]   - On camera, I'm mental.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.760]   - For you, it's a good connotation.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.160]   - No, I'm not your mentor, you're my mentor.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.000]   You can't, that would be a cross in the streams,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.840]   you can't do that.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.640]   - Anyway, so moving on, oh, I was gonna do a commercial,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.080]   let me do a commercial, and then I'm gonna come back
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.520]   and talk about the fact that Google's getting
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.480]   into the power business.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.200]   First, they wanna be a gigabit internet service provider.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.360]   Now, they've got to go ahead to sell power.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.240]   What is going on?
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.680]   Before we get to that though, let me talk a little bit
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.560]   about our friends at Citrix and their product.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.960]   Go to meeting, I'm sure you've heard me talk about
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.160]   Go to meeting before it is a really fantabulous solution
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   for people who are stuck in conference calls,
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.600]   and you'd think with all this marvelous technology
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.200]   we've got right now, we wouldn't have to be doing
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.800]   conference calls, but still I would say,
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.880]   90% of business happens over the phone,
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.840]   and there's a good reason, it's really expensive
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.280]   to travel anywhere, you got airfare and is stressful
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.760]   and all that, so the whole idea is with Go to meeting,
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.640]   you get the benefits of staying in your office,
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.040]   not traveling, with the visual component
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.080]   of a conference call.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.040]   You're on that phone call, you wanna show a spreadsheet
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.520]   or a picture, you wanna show buzz, you wanna show a graph.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.440]   We do it on our shows, we have a couple of hosts now
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.680]   who use Go to meeting to show their screenshots
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.440]   during the show 'cause they're remote.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.800]   People can see what you're talking about,
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.840]   it's great for an online meeting,
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   you can schedule an advance around the fly,
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.000]   everyone sees your computer desktop on their screen,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.320]   you can even trade it around so they see,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.160]   I'll see your computer, you'll see mine,
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.320]   Mac or PC, doesn't matter.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.720]   You can give control, so it's great for training,
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.400]   it's great for sales, presentations, product demos,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.600]   collaboration too, you can say,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.000]   okay, let's work on this together.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.040]   Try it free for 30 days, I know I'm not doing
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.720]   a good job of describing it, it's because it's really
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   very amorphous, it can do whatever you need it to do,
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.920]   it will do.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.480]   Go to meeting, just if it replaces the business trip,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.240]   that's the key for me.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.360]   In fact, if I could figure out a way to do
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.400]   South by Southwest via Go, maybe I will by Go to meeting.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.080]   Go to meeting.com/twig, try it free for 30 days,
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.800]   go to meeting.com/twig, go to meeting.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.960]   We thank Citrix so much for supporting our show.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.880]   Our show.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.720]   So, what is going on, what's the deal?
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.200]   Google is, is this for themselves,
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.800]   or are they gonna sell electricity to other people?
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.160]   - No, they said this a while ago,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.400]   they when they applied for this,
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.240]   because they're doing so much in power,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.840]   at some point regulatory reasons,
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.720]   you have to apply for this right,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.840]   and they have it now.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.240]   - So they may well have surplus power at some point.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.040]   - They could sell power like a utility.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.240]   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.920]   has granted Google energy.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.680]   I'm telling you, we're gonna look back on this and say,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.280]   this was, you know, at some point, there's critical mass
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.920]   where Google just runs everything.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.280]   - I'm proud that in my book,
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.080]   which I haven't plugged in a while,
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.320]   I speculate about,
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.160]   - What's it called?
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.000]   - It's called the Community Power Company.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.720]   - What would Google do about that?
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.840]   - Well, they'd go get the regulatory approval
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.680]   to be a power company.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.520]   You know, it goes, it's the best case
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.200]   of enlightened self-interest I can think of in business.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.880]   If Google through Google.org can lower the cost
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.080]   of clean, renewable fuel, I mean, energy,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.760]   it is a huge boon to the P&L of Google itself
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.680]   and the world too.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.880]   - Well, I think there's a tension here of,
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.760]   there's only a few businesses that require
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.480]   regulatory certification in order to get into them,
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.440]   you know, power, banks, a couple of other things.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.600]   Which of those businesses,
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.520]   if any, would Google not get into, right?
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.000]   Would Google finance someday grow
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.320]   to where they'll be certified as a brokerage house
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.160]   in a bank?
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.520]   Is there anything that they wouldn't say
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.080]   we want to be certified as that?
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.560]   - Prostitution in Nevada?
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.880]   - No, I wouldn't, you know, why rule anything out?
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.640]   - It's in that, there's a valuable AdWords market there.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.900]   (laughing)
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:29.080]   - Larry and Sergey have always been interested in energy.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.080]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.000]   - Even a few years ago,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.760]   they had this thing called renewable energy,
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.840]   less than coal. - This is about the energy
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.600]   of electricity not prostitution, right?
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.200]   - Mm-hmm, so if you can get to that point
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   where RE, less than coal,
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.920]   that really changes the equation in lots of ways.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.040]   So forever Larry, especially, has been one of these guys
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.240]   where you ask about a particular type of fuel cell
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.280]   or something and he knows how many BTUs of energy
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.120]   it puts out.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.280]   So, you know, these are people that really do care
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.960]   about this and pay a lot of attention to it.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.000]   - They talk a lot about the grid being messed up
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.600]   and how more we put our brains and our cars
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.080]   all on the grid, it's gonna be a mess.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.880]   - I want smart grid, smart cars.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.440]   I'm sure Google will be in all of this, why not?
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.480]   - It sounds like they're, basically Google goes
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.520]   into anything that Larry and Sergey are kind of interested
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.720]   in, they'll do.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.240]   - Well, and Larry and Sergey have very wide range
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.440]   in interest. - Yeah.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.240]   - Larry is sort of a true scientist
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.600]   in that, you know, he's happy to talk
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.240]   about all sorts of stuff and Sergey, of course,
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.880]   is a really smart guy too,
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.840]   but, you know, sort of random things that you wouldn't
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.320]   think that they would be interested in.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.000]   Sometimes they surprise you, so.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.760]   - So, Google Gears, R-I-P, finally the end
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.640]   to a Google Gears, Gina, what does that mean?
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.800]   Is it HTML5 that's replacing Google Gears?
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.840]   - Yeah, it looks that way.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.600]   It looks that way.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.520]   Yeah, this is interesting.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.920]   And Neil and I were just talking about this last night.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.120]   I mean, right now, Mac, you know, OS 10.6,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.360]   you know, 10.6 users are kind of left in the lurch
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.200]   'cause we're in this limbo where a few Google apps
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.720]   use Gears and need Gears to give you some nice functionality,
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.120]   but they're not developing it anymore.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.960]   So it sounds like it's not gonna come out for Mac users.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   But. - On Chrome.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.040]   - Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.480]   - 'Cause we were using it on Firefox.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.960]   But no, it doesn't work in the current.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.120]   - Well, the current version of Firefox
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.960]   doesn't have Gears.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.120]   - Doesn't support it, right.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.200]   - Right, doesn't support it.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.040]   - I mean, I think that's just,
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.440]   they haven't gotten it done yet.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.680]   - Well, in the blog post at the Google Code,
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   at a Gears API blog, the title of the post is Hello HTML5.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.480]   - Yeah, I mean, moving HTML5 is a good thing.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.120]   I mean, right now we're just like in a little bit
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.800]   of a painful place where HTML5 isn't quite as, you know,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.400]   doesn't offer the same kind of functionality.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.120]   But what, but moving toward HTML5 is a good thing.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.840]   - What functionality is it?
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.160]   I always thought of Gears as kind of the ability
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.960]   to use Gmail without being online,
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.800]   that kind of thing.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.760]   Is it more than that?
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.600]   - There's that kind of thing.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.440]   There's that.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.560]   And, you know, the one thing that I miss the most,
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.160]   you know, a wave you can drag and drop files into a wave
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.600]   with Gears installed, which, you know,
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.240]   which I don't know if HTML5 would allow for that.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.320]   - So, here's essentially a web applications platform.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.240]   - Yeah, I mean, it is a link between the desktop
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.200]   and the browser and an offline data store.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.680]   So, HTML5 provides an offline data store,
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.520]   but I don't know that if HTML5 would allow
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.080]   for the kind of drag and drop file upload type of thing,
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.000]   that Gears does.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.880]   I don't know, maybe Matt?
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.720]   - I mean, Matt, no.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.800]   - I'm pretty sure it does.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.880]   I think the thing that's interesting about HTML5,
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   kind of philosophically, is it is, you know,
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.600]   all the other HTML versions up to four
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.040]   were really about making better documents.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.560]   And HTML5 is about making better applications.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.440]   And so you have the data store.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.640]   I do think you have some of the drag and drop stuff.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:47.680]   One of the most interesting things in HTML5 is called workers.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   And what these are is kind of background tasks
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.760]   that can run into the background in your web app
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   and be doing little things, you know,
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   in parallel instead of in serial,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.800]   while you're trying to make an application do something,
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.360]   you know, similar to threads on a desktop application.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.320]   And that's a really interesting thing,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.480]   a little bit geeky, but it's a potential that is huge.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.760]   So, I love the next time.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.560]   - To Google announcing this week
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:16.000]   that it's doing a cutting paste to the cloud.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.880]   What's that?
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.840]   - Yeah, I think that's, well,
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.960]   I think that's kind of separate.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.960]   I mean, basically, Google Docs just,
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.720]   you copy something to your Google Docs clipboard
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   and it just creates a document snippet
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.880]   that's saved in Google Docs
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.320]   that you can paste into another Google Doc
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.040]   and another window.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.040]   That's more like sinking your Chromebook marks up to reader.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.720]   It's just another way to store a piece of data in the web app.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.560]   There's no, I don't think it's--
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.200]   - Well, I wonder if it's storing stuff for the cloud,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.720]   why can't it store stuff to my machine?
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   And let me use it on my machine when I'm on the plane.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.200]   - Security.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.040]   - Yeah, I know, but that's the problem.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.200]   - Well, yeah, you need to have a local API,
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.920]   a local storage API if you wanna have things
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.080]   like offline Gmail, but what's really handy,
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.520]   I like what I like about the copy and paste,
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.080]   storing the information in the cloud, you know,
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.960]   in Google Docs, is it can preserve the formatting?
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.880]   So, I don't know if you guys have tried
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.640]   in the developer versions of Chrome,
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.200]   you can do copy and paste and you can paste
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.000]   and a lot of the times the formatting stays,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.560]   the tables and stuff like that.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.560]   In fact, there's a plain text paste.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.120]   If you do control shift V in Chrome,
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.800]   so that gets rid of all the formatting
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.640]   and only paste the raw text.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.880]   But even given that, some browsers might not support that,
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.520]   so by putting it into the application itself,
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.480]   you can make sure that the cells are maintained,
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.040]   the formatting stays the same,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.640]   and you don't have to worry quite as much
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.440]   about what it's gonna look like on the other side
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.560]   when you paste it.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.880]   - Matt, how much are you using your Chrome OS machine?
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.920]   - I'm using it quite a bit.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.520]   There is a new version of Chromium OS
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.720]   that's unofficial from a hacker called Hexa.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.600]   - Oh, you're using the Hexa, the Hexa.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   - I am, oh yes.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.080]   - It's called Flow, the newest version is Flow,
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.720]   the previous one was zero, and it boots really fast.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.960]   It doesn't work on all hardware,
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.360]   but it works on more hardware,
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.080]   and it's just very tight, very nice,
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.640]   and very fast, everything's getting polished off,
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.520]   and this is still basically, I believe,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.280]   a 17 year old kid, maybe in the UK.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.080]   This is not even the official release, so.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   - Amazing.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.160]   - Especially given all the security stuff going on,
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.520]   the idea of having a machine where your OS is locked down,
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.400]   where malware can't even get to it,
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.640]   is really more appealing in the last few weeks or months.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.080]   - Yeah, and you can't do anything offline on that machine?
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.600]   - No, not right now, but as HTML5 gets better,
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.720]   and the local storage APIs take off,
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.680]   then I can certainly imagine you could do things
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.840]   like offline Gmail.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.840]   It's just gonna be a matter of time to march through
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.760]   all that progression of what's supported in HTML5,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.360]   and then in Chrome, and then in the hardware.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.680]   - We can't remember where it's supposed to be.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.040]   - Copy and paste is the kind of thing
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.800]   where I'd love to see an API.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   - Yeah.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.840]   - I think that's where every app on the web can use.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   - It's very fundamental.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.880]   - API to push and pull, copy and paste,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.400]   then we would at least be equivalent
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.520]   to where we were with desktop apps 20 years ago.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.960]   - I wonder if you could use salmon for that,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.720]   'cause isn't that the idea of salmon as a two way?
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.800]   Well, salmon is more--
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.840]   - Some combination of that are, you know,
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.560]   pubs up above or something like that.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.920]   - Yeah, salmon is a little more to pull comments
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.640]   from different places that they have it around the web
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.040]   and make sure that they swim back upstream to you.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.880]   - Oh, okay.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.840]   So it's not as generalized as that, okay.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.160]   - But if I had to, you know, clipboard clients
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.320]   for my Google Docs account and my book--
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.160]   - Would that be cool?
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.720]   - Push out my copy and paste there.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.120]   - What I really want to is,
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.560]   I used to have this in all of their tutorial systems.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.000]   I don't want just one copy and paste.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.640]   I wanna have a copy and paste for every key on the keyboard.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.720]   - Ooh.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.560]   - Yeah.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.400]   - And so I can move this and this and this and this and this,
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.320]   and then compile something together.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.160]   - Yeah.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   - And I think--
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.640]   - Like we said, we've had that on the desktop,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.800]   you know, Microsoft Office stuff for 10 years or 15 years.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.640]   - Right.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.240]   And I think you might be able to get that
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.680]   with the latest copy and paste stuff
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.520]   because it says, well, it will store this
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.000]   in the cloud for a month.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.640]   So after a month, if you don't use something,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.600]   it'll eventually get erased.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.760]   But that sort of implies that there's a certain amount
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.560]   of that that's still around where you can, you know,
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.280]   okay, paste number one, paste number two,
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.600]   and then you can actually get a copy of the new copy.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.200]   - I think we're going to do it.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.840]   - And you can actually, you know, I'm going to do it.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.840]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.680]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.520]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.420]   - It's a great way to do it.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.240]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.080]   - I have to do it.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.920]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.760]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.600]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.440]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.280]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.120]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:28.960]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.800]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.640]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:45.360]   - I'm going to do it.

[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.360]   - I'm going to do it.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   - Extra credit if you can read out Microsoft too.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:42.520]   - One takeaway from any of this seems to be that security on the web just gets more and
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.520]   more important.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.480]   When Chrome came out, people were like, "You're going to update all the time without letting
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.360]   us choose whether to update."
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:55.400]   Looking back, that clearly seems like the right decision going forward or Chrome OS, the idea
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.520]   of locking down the OS and the data gets stored on a different partition that's writable,
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.640]   but the system is not writable.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.480]   We're starting to enter that era of the net where everybody that's on the net has to think
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.320]   about, "Are your web servers patched?
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.040]   Is your OS patched?"
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.640]   If it's not, you might get hacked.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.640]   Those are the sort of decisions people have to start thinking about these days.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.840]   - There was a horrible wording at Davos of a Microsoft executive.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:26.400]   I'm suddenly forgetting who talked about licensing internet users, which I think was a horrendous
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   wording.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.200]   I don't think that even he meant it, but I think it meant more licensing the machines
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.000]   and making sure that they are drivable.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.440]   - Well, the interesting thing about that is we have, I think a lot of people have the
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.880]   conversation about the iPad in terms of control Apple has and what applications can run there.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:53.560]   But we are getting back to the vision of Microsoft Palladium back in 2002 of this is the certification
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.840]   of which applications can run and what can be in this environment.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.960]   What they called trust for the computing or trusted computing.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.360]   Back then, everybody thought it was the devil.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:07.320]   - But you now have Jonathan Zitrain talking about how you really ought to have a traditional
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.040]   machine that one doesn't talk to the other.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.640]   You can have your sandbox still, but I can come to your machine and say, "I don't want
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   to play in your sandbox.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.160]   I only want to play in the Chrome side."
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.880]   - Well, it's interesting that I think in this case, what it was was just that the research
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:24.200]   was right but too far ahead of what people understood about the market and presented in
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:29.320]   such a scary, creepy Orwellian way that I consider said, "Hell no, I don't trust Microsoft
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   to do this."
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:36.360]   And interestingly, we're at this point where apparently we do trust Google or Apple to do
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.360]   that.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.360]   - And I do trust them more than Microsoft, frankly.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   - I don't trust anyone.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   Trust no one.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   - Yeah.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:51.320]   Well, I have friends at all three companies and I think they're all doing good work and
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:52.800]   I don't trust any of them.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.040]   - Well, you can trust them today but you don't know who the board's going to be like in a
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.040]   week or a month or a year or ten years and they don't have all that data.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   - Yeah, there's a bad quarter and need to make some extra money or whatever it is.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.920]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.040]   You always want to have your own data under your own control.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.880]   I would totally agree with that.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.880]   - Yeah.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:16.680]   - Let's do our tip and tool because we have a tipster and actually a toolster.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:23.560]   And I really should give the tool credit goes to you, Jeff, because you tweeted it and got
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.920]   an email from the guy who wrote it and he wants to be on the show.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.840]   So we're going to get Daniel Swickkin on in just a moment.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:34.360]   But before we do though, let's let Gina kick things off with her tip of the week.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.360]   - Sure, sure.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.520]   I'm actually going to skip the buzz tip for now.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.320]   There's a link to the official Google blog with a few tips in the front feed.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:47.000]   I'm going to do something a little more obscure, the Listen app for Android, which Leo featured,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.040]   I think a few shows back.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.480]   Got an update this week, a really good update.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.160]   You can subscribe now to your podcast, In Listen on Android, and it syncs those subscriptions
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.400]   up to Google Reader.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.840]   So if you do the update and you search for and subscribe to a show like I did for this
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   week in Google to listen to last week's miss show that I wasn't on, you'll see a new folder
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.560]   in Google Reader that says my Listen subscriptions.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.600]   So it's got some nice cloud backups.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.640]   You can manage your subscriptions in Reader and they are reflected in Listen.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.000]   So a nice update.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.960]   - Yeah, I'm a big fan of Listen.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.800]   That's how I listen to all my podcasts now.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.240]   So that'll be very nice to have that feature around.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   And Jeff, I...
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   - Now do you know I'm from me?
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   - Now do you know what people think?
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.240]   - The other 24%?
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.240]   - Yeah, that would make us stupid.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.240]   - They were stupid I thought.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   - All the heck with them?
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.240]   Too much Google for them.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.240]   So we're going to get--
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.240]   - No Google for you.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:24.240]   - You tweeted this, I guess it was today didn't you?
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   - No it was few days ago.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   - Two days ago.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   - Because I constantly checking my Google News layout
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.240]   to update the friend feed, or soon buzz
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.240]   and saw that the Google shopper app is out
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.240]   and it's really darn good.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.240]   So I got a response from Daniel the tech lead
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.240]   to say volunteering to be on Twig.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   - Let's get the darn good Daniel on the line right now.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   Daniel Switkin, where are you Daniel?
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.240]   - I'm in New York.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.240]   - Well thank you for joining us.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   - Oh my neighbor, it's Beth.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240]   - Yeah he's just down the road a piece.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:56.240]   If you have any shopping problems Jeff you're ready to go.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   - Well I actually used it, I used it just last night.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   I went on and I used the voice command to find something
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.240]   I won't say what it is because it was my wife's birthday
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.240]   and it gave me the places and I was able to go to the retailer
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.240]   and I showed them my android and I said I want that
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.240]   and they'd walk me over there it was and I bought.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   Google got no credit for that sale except in that sales person's mind
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   but it was very useful.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   - There are a number of programs that let you take pictures
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.240]   of barcodes, Savvy shopper's been around for a long time
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   from big in Japan and some others.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   Daniel how is Google shopper different from those?
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.240]   - Well it's based on a lot of that work.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:38.240]   So I was the co-creator of the Zebra Crossing open source library
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:44.240]   and the author of the barcode scanner capital B capital S on android.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.240]   So Sean Owen and I co-worker started those in 2007
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:53.240]   prior to the android release and then we open sourced those.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   And to my knowledge they are the basis of all of the android scanning apps,
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:00.240]   all the third party apps.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.240]   - That's the same engine.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   - That's right in terms of the actual image processing,
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.240]   the machine vision stuff.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.240]   So then this, go ahead.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   - So I'm sorry, no, I wanted to ask, I was curious about why shopping,
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:18.240]   shopper and Google and goggles, excuse me, are separate apps.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   - Yeah, because they're related aren't they?
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.240]   - Sure.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   We're getting that a lot and I think a good analogy is the difference
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.240]   between web search and product search.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   Web search like goggles tries to solve the general search problem.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:37.240]   You can learn about anything and whereas product search is a vertical.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.240]   And shopper is very much that way too.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:45.240]   Although clearly the apps overlap because they can both search by image,
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.240]   shopper is really about products.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   And so we let you shop by voice and by text.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.240]   You have the full history.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.240]   You have offline use.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   So anything you've seen before is saved locally.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   Comes back up instantly, starring, sharing.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   - Is there any use of the long forgotten, but I still use it frugal in there?
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   - Well, the frugal is product search and that is our source for all the products,
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   reviews, specs, et cetera.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:21.240]   So it's very much, yeah, we are very much building on the shoulders of giants
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:28.240]   with product data, with voice search, with the machine vision that powers goggles.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.240]   Exactly.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   - So it seems like you have the old piece together to make this in fairly short order.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.240]   Was it a big project to make shopper or no, you use the platforms available?
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.240]   - It was actually a pretty big effort.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:48.240]   One key difference between us and shopper is that we're doing continuous image recognition
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:56.240]   and getting that to work and getting that fast has been, it's really one of the things I'm most proud of.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:03.240]   We're able to do about an image a second, even on 3G, just by holding your phone up
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   and that means continuously sending an image to the server, trying to recognize it
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.240]   and returning a response every second.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   - Wow.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   - And whereas previously there are apps like this, we're certainly not the first one.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:23.240]   The SnapTil has been doing product covers for a while, and they use a still photo
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.240]   and then they upload it and then a few seconds later you get the answer.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:34.240]   So I had a co-worker who said, "There's no such thing as too fast," which I really liked.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.240]   That is one of the central themes at Google.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:46.240]   So the push was make this as fast as humanly possible, and we think it'll keep getting faster.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   - That's really neat.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.240]   - So when are we going to see goggles and a shopper for the iPhone?
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   - No comment.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   - Just checking.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:59.240]   - Why bother, just buy a Nexus One for crying out loud and get it over with.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.240]   - What are you going to add local to this?
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:07.240]   I think that the opportunities for local on this are obvious and huge that find in near me
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.240]   the fabled O. Jeff, here's a coupon you want to know about.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.240]   - I think Shop Savvy does that already, doesn't it?
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.240]   - They do have local features.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   - It's quite a cheaper nearby kind of a thing.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240]   It's something we're looking into.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.240]   We've also heard a lot of requests for UK support and other countries.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:32.240]   And all of those things are interrelated now because if we want this to work well in the UK,
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   well, it has to understand British accents.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   It has to recognize British editions of book covers, British barcodes.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.240]   It has to understand and find local stores in England.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   So the more search modalities that you have and the more data you present,
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.240]   the more difficult it is to launch in a new locale because you have to get most,
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   if not all of them, working well.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.240]   - What's cool about this is it isn't just barcodes.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   You can do book covers and other stuff.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.240]   Eric got the barcode right there.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.240]   - Right.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   So we do something kind of unique, which is we scan the barcodes locally.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.240]   They're running the image recognition.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240]   - And then do the--
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.240]   - And we're doing the cover art remotely on the surface.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.240]   - I see.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   - And one of the advantages--
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   - This changes retail so much.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.240]   - Well, and stores hate it.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   There are stores that will throw you out if you whip out your phone and start taking pictures.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.240]   - But those days are over.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.240]   The opacity of market pricing is not going to last anyhow.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.240]   - No, they have to give it up.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:37.240]   - I was talking with the CMO of Best Buy who tweets quite a bit,
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   and they're very, very, very smart.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:45.240]   And the thing I've kept realizing talking to Best Buy is that a store has to become--
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.240]   and Best Buy is becoming more of a media experience.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   And the value it adds is going to be that they have experts so they know what's going on
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   and they find the best stuff.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.240]   But the back end buying of the boxes is going to change pretty radically.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   - One thing that I didn't expect is it's not only for comparison price shopping.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.240]   Something I've been using it for on my Nexus One that I didn't expect to is just building a shopping list.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.240]   You know, you run out of paper plates or something, you take a picture of the barcode,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   just to remind yourself it can be even faster than writing something down in a pad of paper.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.240]   So, you know, you're going through the refrigerator or you're covered and you're like,
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.240]   "Oh, I need a little more of this. I need a little more of that."
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.240]   - That's shareable too, right?
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.240]   So that I can put that in my family list.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   - Currently, right now you can share individual products and you can share your whole wish list.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   But you can't, it's not a bidirectional sync.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   It's just a one-time share.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   - Well, very cool. Daniel, thank you for telling us about this.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.240]   - When did you join Google? - Sure.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   - About three years ago? - Okay.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.240]   So, did you do the Zebra library before you were at Google?
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:54.240]   - No, I started that as a 20% project while I was working on Google Finance.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.240]   And then it just grew from there.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   - That's one of the things that Google does. It's so smart. It's just 20% stuff.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   It's nice to see it.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   - What's your day gig now at Google?
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:07.240]   - Shoppers is my full-time project. I've been working on this for about a year.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.240]   - Well, it's great. It's a nice addition to the Nexus One.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.240]   - Thank you, Brad. - Thank you, Daniel. I really appreciate your time.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.240]   - Yeah, you bet. - Is the developer of Google Shoppers.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   So, I'm going to make that my tool, even though Jeff was yours.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.240]   I'm going to steal it from you.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.240]   - It's real by numbers. You steal my tool.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   - I'm almost stole your numbers. I'm almost stole your numbers.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.240]   There are a lot of great tools, though, on the phone.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   - I'll give you another one. - I'll give you a new apps of you all download.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.240]   - I'll give you one. - I'll give you an eel.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.240]   - Are you on Android and eel?
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.240]   - I am. I'm on a miserable G1.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.240]   - Oh, no, it's cool.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:50.240]   - Yeah, so I actually just asked partially because I wanted to know,
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   and partially as a test of the Think Tank application,
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.240]   what phone I should get, and I've been collecting feedback from everybody
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.240]   across Twitter and Buzz, Dan Facebook.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240]   - Yeah.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   - Still reaching consensus. - Can everybody share an app that they've downloaded recently that they like?
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.240]   - Can I mention that Ted, they were all given Nexus One phones?
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   - Yeah, that was nice.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   - A lot of high-end Nexus One users out there now, all of a sudden.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.240]   - Yeah, unless they regift them.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.240]   - Well, I wonder if Bill Gates is going to use his. I somehow doubt it.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   - They did the same at DLD in Munich.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   - Did they give Nexus One's out?
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.240]   - I'm donating mine to my school, because I already bought mine,
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.240]   because you guys made me.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.240]   - Well, I got in the car where we drive from Munich to Davos
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.240]   and the two people who were in the car, I said, you know,
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   I got a tip to this effect.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   And I said, I think if we wait about half an hour,
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.240]   you're going to get a Nexus One. They waited.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.240]   - And it was so funny to see the crowd just, like,
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.240]   kids getting their graham crackers.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   - It's like when Oprah pulls a car out from under your seat.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   - Well, yeah.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.240]   - Right.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240]   - So I'll give you.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.240]   - If it's we get Google Motors, yeah, that'll be the moment.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.240]   - So I've got a bunch of apps, but nothing to recommend on my Android yet.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.240]   But the one, I guess my mini tip is the Google Dashboard mentioned.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:11.240]   We're very fortunate as consumers that Google's made Dashboard for us.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   And I don't know if there's a mobile version.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.240]   I would love a mobile version of Google Dashboard.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:22.240]   - I wonder if you go in the browser, if you go to google.com/dashboard,
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.240]   if you get, you must get a small version of it.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.240]   - Yeah, no, I'm sure it renders.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.240]   I just think as an app that's kind of giving me a live status,
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.240]   my relationship with this company, that would be kind of cool.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240]   - Right.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   Yeah, I think it's great that they do that.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   I've been using an application that was featured called Alokwa.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.240]   Have you seen this one?
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.240]   - ALOQA.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.240]   I hate to do a featured app because I figure everybody probably already knows about it.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.240]   I mean, I go to the market every day to see what's cool and new and different.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.240]   Well, yeah, Ferrick Schmidt could not know about what was it he didn't know about.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.240]   - You didn't know about Google Sky?
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.240]   - Google Sky?
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   No, he didn't know about layer, right?
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.240]   - No, layer, I'm sorry, layers, you're right, layers.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   - I would hope he'd know about the Google apps.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.240]   - Exactly.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.240]   - So Alokwa is a kind of a local application thing.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:15.240]   It puts up a bunch of icons onto the screen that are based on your locale.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.240]   I've got what's hot in my area, Yelp restaurants.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   So it's kind of like all in one, last FM, music, bars and clubs playing tonight in the area,
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:29.240]   housing, Wikipedia entries in the area, ATMs in the area, pizza, fast food.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.240]   But shopping, but you can add other channels.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.240]   There's additional channels on this.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.240]   It's a free app and it's kind of a great all in one.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   It's kind of like where, which I also use, kind of great all in one.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   It's taken a while to find the other ones, but location-based app.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:53.240]   I really enjoy Alokwa and Hot will tell you what there's a lot of activity going on.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.240]   So the hotpads.com has a couple of great houses for rent.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.240]   Here's somebody playing at the Phoenix Theatre in town.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   And here's another one, Kate Garibaldi is playing live somewhere nearby.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.240]   So it tells-
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.240]   - The power of locals here.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:11.240]   - It's exactly, it's a very good application of local search that I think is very easy to use
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   and very intuitive.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.240]   Alokwa.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.240]   What about you, Gina, you got something you like?
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.240]   - Well, I swipe, as I mentioned earlier, is my favorite keyboard.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   - Yes, that's a good one.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.240]   - Yeah, I have to say that I'm not a big, I haven't gotten any really new apps lately,
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.240]   although I've really been enjoying the Google homepage as a web app.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   It's an app in the market just on the google.com homepage that near me link is pretty neat.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.240]   Just seeing stuff that's going on nearby.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.240]   But yeah, no, otherwise I've just gotten my kind of regular, I've gotten into my groove,
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   I've gotten into a rut, I've got to start looking at the market more, I think.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.240]   - Well, I told you about TuneWicki, I really like that.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.240]   - I like the Thompson Reuters news app.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.240]   - Thompson Reuters?
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240]   - Thompson Reuters?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.240]   - Yep, that's a great one.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:57.240]   There is a Ustream broadcaster now, so you can actually shoot Ustream livestreams with your phone.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.240]   The camera is so good on this phone, I have to say, I really enjoy taking pictures with it.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   And yeah, if you've got buzz, don't forget to open Google Maps and turn on the buzz layer,
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.240]   because then you can embed your pictures into the map.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.240]   And then when you've got the buzz layer turned on, it doesn't, not a lot of people buzzing
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   in Petaluma, but when I was in San Francisco, there's little buzz things everywhere all around
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.240]   and that's kind of fun too.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240]   - That's nice.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.240]   Matt Cutts, thank you so much.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.240]   You have a pick before we let you go?
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:31.240]   - Oh boy, I'm such an Androidaholic, so there's an LED scroller.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.240]   - Oh man, I got to get that.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   - Oh, that one.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240]   - That one's just LED scroller.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.240]   There's a really fun one called Tricorder, which is just a way to see all the different
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.240]   sensors on your phone.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:50.240]   So for example, if I go like that, you can actually see the accelerometer doing stuff
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.240]   like that.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.240]   But I have to say my favorite app lately is one called App Referrer.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   And all that does is it shows you a list of all your apps, and if you press a given application,
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:09.240]   it will display it as a barcode so that your friend can scan it.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.240]   So now you can do peer to peer sharing.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.240]   Like if someone were to take a picture of that screen with their barcode scanner, which
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.240]   Daniel Switken wrote, you were just had him on the screen.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   Now they can install that application without having to look in the market at all.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.240]   So I can give you, if we want to trade LED scroller apps, I just hold it up, you take a picture
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   with your phone and you're good to go.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240]   - That's great.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   - That's clever.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240]   - I'm writing all of these down because I didn't.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   - I'm not writing them down, I'm downloading them as a talk.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240]   - You do.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.800]   - You know, I didn't ask you, and I meant to ask you Matt, we had a big conversation on
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.640]   Twitter this week about something called demand media, which is a very, you know about it,
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   I guess.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   - Right.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:50.440]   - And it's a very interesting way, it's really to me, it seems a way to game Google by creating
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:58.640]   a lot of pages with kind of, you know, barely adequate content in a niche area to drive
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   traffic.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   - Right.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.560]   Demand media has been a very divisive polarizing thing because they had this article come up
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.200]   in Wired that sort of portrayed them as very low quality content.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.360]   And of course, if you listen to demand media, they say that, no, no, we're very high quality
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:17.240]   content and we're a way that freelancers can get, you know, a reliable source of income.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.960]   - So, you have 20 bucks a pop.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.520]   - Yeah, you have to work pretty hard to get it.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.320]   So from our perspective, we've tried very hard to reduce the amount of web spam, which
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.720]   means that the bar to do well on the web has gone up a little bit, you always see people
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.560]   who will try to produce the bare minimum of work or the bare minimum of content to try
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.040]   to do well.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.360]   The nice thing is that, you know, and your position on demand media depends on a lot
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.360]   of different things about your opinion.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.040]   Within Google, we have seen a lot of feedback about people saying, yeah, there's not as
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:50.440]   much web spam, but there is this sort of low quality, mass generated content where, you
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.400]   know, it's a bunch of people being paid a very small amount of money.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.360]   So we have started projects within the Search Quality Group to sort of spot stuff that's
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.400]   higher quality and rank it higher, you know, and that's the flip side of having stuff that's
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.120]   lower quality, not rank as high.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.600]   So I think if your business model is solely based on mass generating huge amounts of nearly
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.560]   worthless content, that's not going to work as well in 2010.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560]   And, you know, I'll just--
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.520]   - Just a rather than just plain black and bold, you're with a bad stuff, you're trying
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.880]   to curate better the good stuff.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.240]   - Yeah, you definitely want to write algorithms that will find the signals of good sites,
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:31.080]   you know, the sorts of things like original content rather than just scraping someone or,
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.200]   you know, rephrasing what someone else has said.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.160]   And if you can find enough of those signals, and there are definitely a lot of them out
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:41.760]   there, then you can sort of say, okay, find the people who break the story or who produced
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.000]   the original content or who produced, you know, the impact on the web and try to rank
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.640]   those a little higher rather than just trying to push down everyone that's bad because
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.320]   news alert, there will always be more bad people.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.440]   - And that's a challenge for Google News as well.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:01.120]   And I argue that in the link economy, it becomes an ethical matter to link to content
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.080]   and journalism and news at its source so that you can support it by links because that's
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.400]   how you get the support.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.880]   I've interviewed Stephen Kidd from Demand Media and Sean Colo.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.200]   I ran a panel with him in Munich at DLD.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.800]   I think it's important though, Leo, to recognize that Demand Media has a key insight that's
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.520]   a lesson for the rest of media.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.640]   It's one I learned at about.com where they really look at their Google queries all the
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.240]   time and say, oh, look, people are asking for this.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   They're asking this question.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.240]   We don't have an answer.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.240]   Let's write it.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.600]   In my old days of media, we decided what questions to ask.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.240]   And so Demand just does that algorithmically and they look at the highest demand for content
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:42.840]   and the highest demand for advertising and put it together.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.840]   And I don't blame them for that.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.320]   I think it's very smart.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.240]   My theory though, and I want to see if Matt checks me on this, my theory is that the
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:54.720]   more Google goes to personalized search that takes the signals, as they talked about in
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:01.720]   Buzz, to find out where you are, who you are, what you do, the less SEO as a dark art can
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:10.440]   succeed in making that kind of mass-produced, cheaply-produced stuff succeed because everybody's
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.840]   search becomes different.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:16.560]   Definitely personalization and things like local search results, even by Metro, rather
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.440]   than even by country.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.120]   Sort of take a monolithic set of search results and break that down into a bunch of different
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.120]   search results.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.120]   And that's a really good thing.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.480]   You don't want to be competing with every plumber in the world.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.520]   You'd rather be competing with the plumbers in your nearby area.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:33.280]   And then that's good for users because they get local plumbers as well.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.920]   So I think that's the way that things are going.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.960]   There's always going to be a need for evergreen, really useful content.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.320]   Some of the most, you know, red comments or red posts on my blog are things like how
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   to hack the iPhone was a post I did several years ago.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.200]   And, you know, what Firefox extensions do I use?
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.520]   And that's useful for people across the world, not just in individual places.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.560]   But increasingly, if you go to Google and you type something like bank, if you're in
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.160]   the UK versus Australia versus the United States, you really don't want Bank of America
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.200]   in Australia and you really don't want, you know, other countries banks if you're looking
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.120]   for something that's really relevant to you.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.240]   So personalization and all of those sorts of things means there's no longer one set
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.840]   of search results you can bookmark and someone in Topeka or someone in Transylvania will
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.680]   see the exact same thing as you.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.160]   Now it's much more diverse.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.680]   It's much more useful for individual local searchers.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.640]   Well, I'm glad I brought up the subject.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.840]   I don't want to get too, too long a conversation.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   We'll just have to have you back and talk more about it.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.680]   I think you would leave if you want to have the people from demand media on to their very
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.400]   public about it and open about it.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400]   I'm willing to enter the debate.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   And I think you make some good points.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.000]   The oldest closure here too is I was asked to be an advisor and I turned it down just
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.720]   so that I could maintain my independence in talking about this.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.440]   That's where Saul Hansel ended up going, right?
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.240]   No, Saul Hansel is doing the equivalent at AOL.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   Oh, see.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.240]   You have it.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.720]   The paid content had a conference in New York on Friday and it kind of had all these
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.160]   together at one place, which is AOL is doing this, trying to find new quality ways to
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160]   do it.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.320]   Associated content does it.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.080]   Sweet 101 does it.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.080]   Demand does it.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   And about does it.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.780]   It's not a different model, but they're all trying to create content to be on the other
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.280]   side of a search query.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.280]   Right.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   Very interesting.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.120]   But here's the other important thing that happens to them.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.120]   No, they all stop.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.320]   We talked a bit fast about the spheres of discovery.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.520]   The old media brand was a sphere.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.920]   Search was a sphere, algorithms were a sphere.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:35.120]   And now the importance of Twitter, buzz, and Facebook, that is to say human recommendation
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:41.520]   of content as a means of discovery, I think is very important to get past this notion
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.320]   of spam and content farms.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.120]   And if people are recommending things, which is what's happening, we're all going to Twitter
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.120]   and buzz now asking a question and getting an answer.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:57.800]   The more you can capture that value, I think the less of this content farm, chaff is going
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:00.400]   to be a problem.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.920]   We are going to wrap this up.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.920]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.640]   Matt Cuts is in charge of fighting webspam at Google.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.640]   It's nice to get it.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   God bless you, sir.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   God bless him.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:13.600]   He's doing God's work there at the Google ranch.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.280]   Anytime you want to read more from Matt, Matt Cuts.com is one of the most forthcoming
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.320]   and interesting fellows there at Google.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.720]   We really appreciate you joining us on this week in Google.
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.440]   We don't, you know, it's really, really nice to have you.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:32.440]   Of course, we also want to thank the great Neil Dash, who is just a great thinker, a
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:38.400]   great blogger, and now runs expert labs at expertlabs.org and was smart enough to get
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   Gina on board.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.400]   Very fortunate.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.400]   Very, very lucky.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   It's great.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.400]   Have fun at the AAAS in San Diego.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.400]   Thank you.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   And I guess I'll see you at South by Southwest.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   Absolutely.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   Yay.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   And you too, Gina.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.400]   See you down there.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.960]   Gina Tripp, thumbs up.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.520]   Gina Trippani is at smartawear.org.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.520]   That's her blog.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.920]   Great place to get lots of useful tips and information.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:04.160]   She's still working on the complete wave guide at completewaveguide.com.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.840]   And I've been told by her chat room that they have complete buzz guide.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.840]   Should you decide?
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.240]   You want to branch out.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.240]   So sweet.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.240]   I love our chat room.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.240]   They're so awesome.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   Aren't they great?
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.040]   They just assigned homework to you.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.040]   That's right.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   We need a new book.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.560]   Gina, would you like to write it?
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   It's great to have you, Gina.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.560]   We'll see you next week.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.600]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:31.400]   And he's an adjunct professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.080]   No, I'm on staff, not adjunct.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.080]   Not adjunct.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.080]   A real-life professor.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.080]   Associate professor.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.280]   Associate professor, the penurious professor.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.320]   And also the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:44.720]   And if you would all just go out and buy a couple of copies right now, we wouldn't call
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.080]   them penurious anymore.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.560]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.560]   Great to see you all.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.560]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.840]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
