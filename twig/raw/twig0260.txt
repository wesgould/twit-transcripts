[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.600]   This week in Google, episode 260,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.400]   recorded July 30, 2014, living La Vida cloudy.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.320]   It's time for this week.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.560]   Kid Google.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.800]   Show the coverage, Google, the cloud, the Twitter,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.000]   the Facebook.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.920]   Whenever are esteemed panelists.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.080]   I want to talk about that's because they are so esteemed.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.120]   He's just steamed.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.080]   That's Jeff Jarvis, the king of the rant from the City
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.160]   University of New York.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.880]   Cooling down my bursitis.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.520]   Oh, ow.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.480]   What is bursitis?
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.920]   Just is that a painful butt?
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.280]   Well, actually that's where it is.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880]   Yes, it's an inflammation of the bursa.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.640]   Ooh.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.400]   Don't get--
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.600]   Don't be 60 people.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.320]   Don't do it.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.920]   It's all downhill now, Jeff.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.560]   It's the pause.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.280]   I thought it was an inflamed bro.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.160]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160]   Jeff has had a no good, terrible, very bad day.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.000]   A flat tire, a broken Mac.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   A light bulb just blew out.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.080]   You should just get under the covers.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.760]   Yesterday, I had a three o'clock appointment
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.840]   and a fourth appointment, and I transposed them
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.760]   in my other calendar.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.600]   And so I then told them both to change,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.120]   realizing I was wrong for each,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.880]   and trying to get back ahold of them to make sure it was
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.200]   back where it was.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.400]   I'm just telling you, it's just not working.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.960]   Well, just let's we'll take it easy today.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's going to be a nice day.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.600]   Relaxing, fun day, gathering with the friends.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.640]   Jeff is a blogger at buzzmachine.com, author of Public
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.960]   Parts, what would Google do and many other wonderful things.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.880]   She and the Trippanies here, founding editor of Life Hacker,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120]   host of all about Android.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.600]   She's the creator of ThinkUp, a fabulous analytics platform
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.240]   for your social media, ThinkUp.com.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.200]   Yes, hello.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   Hey.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   I'll be here.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.520]   I like kind of chill days.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.880]   We're going to chill today.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.120]   We could talk about Jeff's computer design.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.640]   We could talk about my computer decision, yeah.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.000]   Wait a minute, what computer decision?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.600]   Well, my Mac is bored.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.160]   So you're going to-- well, you know, it's perfect because Apple
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.960]   just came out with new Mac Pros.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.520]   Do you want a desktop, a laptop?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.000]   What do you want?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.360]   Leo, Leo, no, you're going to make fun,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.480]   but this is the advancement in the world.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.080]   You're living in the past.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.800]   I'm debating getting anything.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   You don't need a computer.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.120]   I don't know.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.800]   The cloud.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   Get a Chrome.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.080]   The idea that you have to have a computer upon which you
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.600]   download things and store things was an idea for a while.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.720]   But the structure of phones where you have local apps,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.080]   but basically all your data is up somewhere else,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.840]   that's the way it operates and the apps can operate anywhere.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.640]   That's the way Chrome operates, the same architecture.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.960]   I'm thinking the only reason I got your--
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.120]   what's your box, your thing?
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   What's the printer box that you advertise once?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.960]   Oh, yeah, the Xprint server, yeah.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   Yes, I got that going.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.200]   So you print to Google, right?
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.280]   Two reasons to exist.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.560]   One was the print server.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.760]   I then messed up the--
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.200]   I can't get the printer back into the Google print
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.920]   because I deleted it.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.880]   I don't have a working computer to put it in there.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.720]   So I--
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.120]   but I'll figure this out.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.280]   And the only other reason, the only other reason
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.160]   for the last year I have used that machine was Skype for you.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.360]   Well, don't get a new one.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.840]   That's it.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.920]   So I was thinking maybe to go get a mini.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.760]   The only reason I have a desktop computer
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.120]   is so I can have big screen real estate.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.640]   That's the only reason.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.680]   And I have-- I mean, I have a home on my desk,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.360]   a 31-inch monitor, 4K monitor, and two 27-inch monitors.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.000]   That-- you need a computer to do that.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.200]   It could be a laptop, I guess.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.000]   But I have a magnet.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.840]   You can do a laptop to that.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.560]   I mean, I plug this laptop.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.840]   So you don't-- but you're not saying--
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.640]   when you say computer, you mean laptop or desktop, right?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.320]   You're just thinking, I don't need to get anything to replace this.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.600]   You're getting rid of all local storage,
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.640]   basically, is what you're saying.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.200]   You don't need local storage.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.160]   Like a hard drive, a physical hard drive, right?
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.200]   Jeff?
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.960]   Right.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.120]   So this is the show about the cloud.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.680]   I think I'm about to become--
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.960]   Well, the cloud needs an endpoint in your home.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.640]   You can't just-- you do have to have something in home
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.600]   that attaches to the cloud.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.440]   My cloud doesn't flow into your mind.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.040]   So Chromebook--
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.440]   Chrome.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.320]   I think Chromebook is in it.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.920]   You have a pixel.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.800]   You have several pixels.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.320]   That's enough.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.760]   What's Chrome?
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.320]   Why would you need anything more?
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.080]   You don't edit video.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.880]   You don't--
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.480]   You're not a photographer.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.160]   Oh, but I did--
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.680]   You don't play games.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   You don't play games.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.560]   I'm not on my own.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.080]   If you were a photographer, you would not want a Chromebook.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.920]   Well, no.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.160]   But if I'm going to do 100 photos--
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.920]   This is the use case, I think, for regular folks,
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.800]   or for someone like Jeff, who primarily is a writer, right?
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.720]   But the photo thing is where I kind of stop.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.640]   And I know that you can upload all your photos to Google
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.720]   plus photos.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.360]   And I do that.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.040]   I have my autoback up on my phone now.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.400]   But I have gigabytes of photos that I
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.440]   took pre-Google+, that I don't really want to upload to the cloud.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.200]   Because I know to get them out would be a multi-gigabyte download.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   And why wouldn't I just have the hard drive and myself?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.400]   But I get the argument for not maintaining your own--
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.480]   I've got a stack of external drives at home.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.680]   My archives of stuff before the cloud ever happened.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.480]   And I don't know, though.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.800]   It just makes me nervous.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.640]   I'm going to make everything--
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.760]   I'm going to do something.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   Go ahead.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.360]   I have never been organized.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.760]   So I don't have any of that.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.440]   But to be fair, you have a use case
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.680]   that doesn't need a desktop computer.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.080]   You don't edit video.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.840]   You're not a serious photographer.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.920]   Serious photographer, the shooting camera, raw.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.680]   Serious photographer with a bunch of volume.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.480]   But the photo--
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.200]   It's not purely for storage.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.440]   It's because of raw processing photo, raw.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.560]   You need Lightroom.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.400]   You cannot do that on a Chromebook, period.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.440]   So there's certain things that you need to have a computer for.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.840]   But you don't do any of those things.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.000]   I don't design.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.360]   And you're not alone, by the way.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.600]   Most people don't.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   No.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.520]   Why are you making--
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.800]   The kind of photography most people
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.400]   do with their smartphone.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.880]   It automatically uploads to Google+,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.200]   Google+, gives you all sorts of great features
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.840]   that for a normal person is plenty.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.000]   Most of my photography is done on Google+,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.680]   I don't use Lightroom for a lot of it.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   So that makes sense.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.440]   I'm just trying to think of if there's anything
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.480]   that you might want to do--
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.840]   I can now do Microsoft Word documents for those--
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.340]   Right.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.680]   --that you still use it in Chrome.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.280]   It's not the greatest.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.440]   No, I don't think you need a computer.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.440]   When you sat down at your Mac, what would you do?
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.680]   You would do Skype.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.200]   You'd do that.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   And that's it.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.320]   Nothing.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.840]   It sits off to the core over here, off camera.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   I think you're fine.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.080]   And the poor corpse.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.920]   And--
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.640]   Yeah, rid of it.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.680]   Save some desk space.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.960]   Yeah, I'm even sitting.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.880]   I got my pixel, which as you know, I adore.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.240]   But I'm thinking for trips.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.300]   Because they're so interchangeable,
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.580]   I might get the HP with--
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.020]   or one of the new ones that has eight or 10 hours of battery.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.460]   Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.820]   I would like to get that Dell.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.660]   But I think they've taken that off the market.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.300]   For some new ones.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.140]   --coming.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.420]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.060]   So we got the-- for Michael, who's in sixth grade,
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.100]   we got the Acer C720.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.020]   It's $200.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.620]   It's little.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.020]   It's light.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.340]   If you lose it, no big deal.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.020]   And that's the best part about the cloud.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.100]   You log into Jeff Jarvis at gmail.com.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.980]   And now everything's there.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.440]   I'm the same as if I am anywhere.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.780]   And so--
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.620]   I really like that.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.820]   The only thing about a pixel is it's
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.460]   between five and six hours of battery, which
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.700]   is when I'm around town, it's absolutely fine.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.260]   No problem.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.420]   I go to the office, I plug it in.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.340]   I come here, I plug it in.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.700]   I go to the--
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.420]   You don't game, you don't do photography.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.460]   You don't do video.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.340]   I mean, there are a lot of uses for a computer,
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.060]   but none of you do not.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.380]   I think you're a good candidate, actually,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.220]   to live in the cloud.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.500]   The whole idea scares the crap out of me,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.500]   but I think it's great for you.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.100]   Well, you're a programmer, Gina.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.180]   You're not going to program in the cloud?
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.100]   That's the thing.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.820]   I can't do it because that's right.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.540]   The software that I spend most of my day in
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.900]   is a tech statitor with a bunch of plug-ins.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.180]   I guess you could do that.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:24.980]   I've seen--
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.620]   That's going to change, too.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.540]   Yeah, I have some web-based editors.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.100]   It's true.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.780]   Hooked in to get--
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.300]   Here's what I'm going to argue.
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.780]   I think you want to run your debugger locally on a local CPU.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.540]   Yes, I do.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.660]   Well--
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.100]   I would feel-- look, programming is hard enough.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.100]   Here's my issue with cloud is if it makes anything at all
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.580]   harder than I don't want to do it.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.620]   It's the same problem I have with using the iPad
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.940]   as my main computer.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.140]   Yeah, you could do it or your phone.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.980]   You could do it, but it's just a little harder.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.980]   Well, why would you make it a little harder?
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.060]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.460]   All right.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.380]   But what I'm trying to say is directionally,
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.580]   where this goes, that you wouldn't have ever stored
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.980]   all your documents up on this somewhere else.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.540]   It's been offered for a long time.
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.220]   Apple offered it ages ago and it was awful
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.300]   and you didn't do it.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.620]   But it's now reached its usable critical mass.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.940]   It's reliable enough.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.260]   It doesn't go down much.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.340]   Furthermore, because we've gotten used to this idea
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.140]   because we have multiple computers at home at work,
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.860]   maybe several at home, several at work,
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.420]   and what you want is the same data set on everything.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.740]   And the cloud is the only way to solve that.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.500]   And as disorganized as I am to be able to sync before,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.620]   I was awful at it.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.140]   Right.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.740]   Terrible.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.380]   Right.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.500]   So you probably have reams of documents
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.140]   that you produced over the years, Jeff.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.060]   What do you do with those?
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.860]   Have you just uploaded all of those to drive at this point?
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.780]   Do you use drivebox?
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.140]   No, I don't state everything that way.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.740]   I mean, I have boxes of clips in the basement,
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.700]   which my wife hates.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.140]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.820]   You've given us years and years and years ago.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.180]   But no, once my book is done, I don't care what the file is.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.500]   Can you-- here's a question I don't know the answer to.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.820]   Could you take a large USB drive, plug it into your Chromebook
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.780]   and download your entire Google Drive onto it as a local storage?
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.620]   Can you do that, Gina?
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.020]   Do you know?
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.820]   Yeah, you can do that.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.900]   You can.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.540]   So why don't you do that?
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.140]   And you can work offline, right?
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.300]   There's offline support.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.060]   But I'm just thinking--
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.700]   Yeah, you could do that without the USB.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.460]   But to save your stuff locally, which I think is a good idea.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.340]   I mean, Google's not going out of business.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.780]   But why rely on some third-party corporation
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.780]   to store your stuff?
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.340]   You should have a local drive.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.580]   But if you can do that--
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.100]   Then that's fine.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.100]   You could sync it to Dropbox.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.100]   Dropbox, yeah.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.020]   And by the way, we're doing this in entertainment as well.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.420]   Do you buy disks anymore?
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.460]   Do you rent disks anymore?
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.100]   Very much now, we stream everything.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.660]   It's all in the cloud.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.420]   Even-- I don't want to buy rent movies.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.860]   I just get them on demand.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.060]   I mean, I do rent them, but I guess I don't want the disk.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.700]   Right.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.140]   Aren't we all moving in that direction?
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.340]   Is physical media is gone?
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.060]   Or even just downloading the giant file legitimately or not.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.980]   I got tired of that.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.060]   I was just going to have to download two gigabytes.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.260]   I don't want to wait that long.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.980]   I want to start watching right now.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.540]   Yeah, I'll spend whatever 15 bucks on Google Play
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.940]   or wherever I need to buy.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.220]   Just get it right now and not have to worry about it.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.100]   Same thing with music.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.980]   We used to have record collection.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.300]   And every time you move to biggest pain in the ass,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.580]   you box up these records, you move them.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.220]   All of those, you have them all.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.980]   You don't even have to buy them now.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.860]   Any time you want, you listen to Google Music.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.660]   And it's all 20 million songs.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.260]   The entire collection is there.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:35.620]   Right.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.860]   That entire bookshelf behind me.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.820]   Now, on the other hand, I went into--
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.580]   sometimes my favorite rabbit hole
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.860]   is to go to the New York Times time machine.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.340]   Love that.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.500]   And go to old clips.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.980]   I found a great one this week.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.540]   I wrote about it on a medium.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.980]   What happened to newspaper illustrators when photography came?
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.100]   And it was right in the moment of disruption.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.940]   When Lincoln died, the illustrators rushed
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.700]   on train from New York to Washington to go and look
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.900]   at everything and sketch and draw.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.540]   And then draw their finals on the train
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.060]   the way back to get them in.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.980]   When McKinley died, photographers existed.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.140]   And they didn't have to exist.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.580]   One day, the newspaper had 85 people in the art department.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.620]   Many of them eliminated.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.860]   It's a picture of what we have today.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.580]   This is a wonderful piece.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.940]   So in this process, I found another book about fire
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.020]   and electricity.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.820]   And it was a third thing.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.540]   But 1901 book about, oh my god, technology.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.140]   And it's just so mirrors the thoughts we have today.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:37.500]   I love it.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.060]   So I bought that good old book.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.660]   And I like that.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.420]   But the truth is, I could also, because it's so old,
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.740]   I could buy that as digital.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.100]   I don't think that is a book.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.820]   It's an emotional thing.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.460]   I kind of like having the book, though.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.420]   But that's--
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.940]   I know.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.620]   You're holding on-- what I'm trying to say to you
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.940]   is you're holding on to your computer the same way you're--
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.140]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.740]   I think you're right.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.220]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.380]   I mean, I am sort of clinging to it,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.380]   just because I'm like, I need--
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.900]   I need local-- I need my hard drives.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.820]   They make me feel better.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.700]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.060]   You're right.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.260]   It feels like--
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.740]   Realistically, I don't use them during the day.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.660]   It feels like what Jeff's doing is a little risky.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.060]   It does.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.100]   It feels like he's leaping off a cliff.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.260]   I'm trying to imagine just having a Chromebook who would
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.060]   freak me out.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.380]   That's why I wanted to raise it today.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.140]   Yeah, I'd just see what you thought.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.460]   But I'm not seeing a reason to go out and spend $600.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.340]   The minimum I can buy-- I'm not going to buy a Windows machine.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.500]   Sorry, Paul Thorett.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.060]   Not doing it.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.420]   No, you'd be nuts to buy a Windows machine.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.860]   I'd be-- I'd be driving insane.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.980]   So the minimum purchase would be $600 for a--
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.540]   Mac Mini.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.780]   Don't do it.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.380]   You could even hook up a big screen--
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.900]   if you wanted a big screen monitor and a typewriter keyboard,
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.340]   you could hook it up to your Chromebook
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.060]   or get a Chromebook Mini, a Chromebook box.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.420]   But my keyboard is great.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.340]   I don't need a Mini.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.460]   I mean, I can hook this up to the--
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.660]   I can hook it right now.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.100]   And the truth is, tell us in the chat, I'm saying it's very risky.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.740]   It's not risky.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.500]   In fact, it's less risky because you're trusting the cloud
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.940]   provider to keep your data safe.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.700]   And I think that it's mature enough now that that's
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.220]   a reasonable thing to do.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.180]   The only issue is privacy.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.900]   The only issue is if you had stuff,
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:18.020]   nude pictures of yourself that you didn't want to trust in the cloud
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.180]   because the NSA would pass them around because you're such a stud,
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.220]   then you would want to keep those in some local fashion that is not connected there.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.380]   No, you want to encrypt them.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.300]   Leo, you want to encrypt them.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.980]   Or you encrypt them.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.700]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.580]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.580]   How are you encrypting them?
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.060]   You can't.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:34.980]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.900]   You can't encrypt them.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.420]   Not reliably because you no longer have a computer.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.220]   The only way to do that reliably is to do that locally in a local CPU.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.380]   Or I could email them myself.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.540]   What do you do for a Chromebook for encryption?
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.100]   Is there a plugin?
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.700]   I don't know.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.660]   Is there a true--
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.660]   Is there a way to--
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.340]   Email.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.620]   Yeah, email.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.260]   Well, but see, OK, so if that's happening, then--
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.260]   yeah, Google has this new thing where there's some JavaScript that's doing the encryption.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.380]   It's possible to do a public key crypto with a JavaScript only.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.220]   Now, the other thing--
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.220]   It's not exactly a trust no one in that case, however.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.700]   Back to the risk piece, I accidentally screwed up.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.140]   Pardon me, I'm writing this long, boring thing now.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.460]   And I screwed up and erased five paragraphs I've just written.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.820]   And by Google versioning, it was there from last night.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.340]   It was fine.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.180]   Boom, one button.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.100]   I was done and I was happy.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.500]   So I never versioned my stuff that way.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.340]   Trying to get to Microsoft Word versioning was torture.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.980]   It never stored the version you wanted.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.540]   It was, hey, hey, it's awful.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.220]   Yeah, the doc stuff is really great.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.260]   I mean, it's really great.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.260]   In fact, today, my coworkers pointed out, and I actually think I missed this in the changelogs.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.660]   I think it was the week I was on vacation.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.540]   But you can do, like, suggested edits.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.380]   You can either get somebody edit rights.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.300]   Or you can give them the right to comment, which actually turned into suggested edits,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.300]   where you can then sort of--
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.500]   I just kind of snuck in the night.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.500]   You know, accept reject.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.740]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.740]   It's fantastic.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.820]   It's like, yeah, this is the way this is supposed to work.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.820]   I mean, they really have.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.020]   And the versioning is awesome.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.420]   And you all get that for free.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.980]   You never have to actually physically save your file.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.020]   I mean, it's great.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.180]   It's great modern software.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:10.780]   It's great.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:16.020]   So, Jeff, what happens when your publisher sends you some crazy word template that you
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.740]   have to use for your book, which is what Wiley did to me.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.620]   They sent me this crazy word document.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.700]   It was like all these different templates and formatting and roundabout thingers.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.540]   I don't know if you remember what I had to do, but I had to hunt down the right software
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.060]   to open it.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.740]   Does that-- I mean, I guess an author of your caliber could say screw you.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.180]   I'm going to use the template I want.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.020]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.300]   It's just words.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:45.020]   The thing that I'm writing now is this probably about 50,000 word white paper on--
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.660]   now that you're frigging internet has ruined everything, Jarvis, what now?
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.300]   And it's all my thoughts on new relationships, new forms, and new models.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.260]   And I put the relationship stuff up on medium already.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.860]   So there's now a Google add-on-- I can't remember-- librio or something like that-- that
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:06.500]   will turn your Google doc into a ebook, the most important thing.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.340]   So I'd use that.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.460]   The chairman says I should just buy you a computer and send it to you.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.900]   No, but we're trying to be pureed.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.900]   I don't think you should.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.220]   And I don't think what you're doing is risky in the least.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.060]   In fact, let's face it, it's much less risky.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.820]   How many people have lost data on their home computer?
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:25.340]   Many.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.500]   Well, my own machine.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.380]   Yeah, my-- I-- Ioware.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.140]   Ioware.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.140]   Ioware.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.540]   That would have been enough to put me into cardiac arrest a year ago.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.220]   Now I just said, oh, crap.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.620]   Ben, that must be me, he says, what if Google locks your account?
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.780]   What are you going to do?
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.300]   Well, yeah.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.260]   That's the big risk.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.940]   That's the big risk that your account's locked out.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.340]   It would be a good idea to have a backup of some kind.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:55.740]   I need to know how to sync to Dropbox.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.820]   I haven't-- I'm sure it's--
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.020]   Well, that's why I asked you-- and this would be the best way to do it.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.940]   If you can, plug in a hard drive to a Chromebook and say,
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.700]   Google, give me all my data and put it on the--
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.460]   But even better.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.460]   But then I didn't do it for a week, Leo, which is what the case always was.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.620]   I never backed up, right?
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.220]   So what I would--
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.220]   You want to see--
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.100]   Drive is it does it automatically.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.300]   What if I had a structure--
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.300]   Does Google automatically--
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.500]   So that's interesting.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.100]   So obviously--
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.100]   Did you do an IFTTT?
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.660]   And if this then that--
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.940]   Yeah, like if there's a new document in Drive,
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.700]   then sync it to Dropbox.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.500]   Well, you know what?
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.500]   The problem is there, Gina, there's a new document to drive every three
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.860]   characters.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.860]   So what you probably want to do is do a daily.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:36.860]   Right.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.500]   Do an IFT-- IFT-- if this then that at a time?
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.780]   It only does it every 15 minutes anyway.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.780]   It's not real time.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.460]   That's a 15 minutes.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.140]   It's pretty good.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.060]   I mean, even in the case you said that last night and you deleted,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.580]   I mean, that would have still had the--
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.180]   It's drop-boxed to save revisions.
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.580]   I need your help.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.860]   We want some way to sync all of your Google data in real time,
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.020]   constantly in the background to some other service.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.300]   It could be Amazon.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.300]   It could be Dropbox.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.300]   It could be Firefox.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.340]   It should have been what Firefox-- backupify did, unless--
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.460]   Your backupify used to kind of do this.
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.780]   Are they still alive?
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.500]   They have been much constrained.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.340]   I know that they sent me an out saying,
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.500]   we're not going to be doing--
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.300]   I think they've gone enterprise.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.340]   Oh.
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.940]   But I wonder-- they back upify for Google Apps.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.500]   I mean, I don't have the Apple time machine in here in the home,
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.940]   but that does still stop working.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.500]   What you want is a time machine for Google.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.740]   You want a virtual time machine?
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.500]   You want a cloud time machine?
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.420]   This will do it.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.220]   Every day, set it and forget it with backupify's automyock.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.340]   It's only three times a day.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.580]   I think that's sufficient.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.860]   Google Mail Chat, Drive, Calendar, Contact, and Sites.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.500]   It uses 256-bit encryption uptime.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.380]   You actually answered our question, Jeff, backupify.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:58.700]   Wow.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.980]   Everybody should do this, regardless of their Chrome OS only.
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.860]   But this is for apps.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.540]   This is not for public.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.140]   You have to have the paid--
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.640]   Wow.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.340]   And that's what happened.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.220]   They went enterprise.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.700]   They used to do it just to--
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.580]   they do it for Salesforce, for social media,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.580]   and for Google Apps.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.340]   Wow.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:14.840]   Wow.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.620]   That is a great idea.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.180]   That is?
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.220]   That is great.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:18.660]   It must--
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.420]   That backs up to backupify.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.860]   There needs to be a consumer solution for this.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.180]   And that way, you're just--
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.620]   it's not a lack of faith in Google.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.980]   It just answers that question.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.220]   It's that security blanket.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.740]   Google Realtime API.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:38.300]   This is from BB16 in our chat room.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.700]   Oh, there's an API.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.780]   So somebody could easily write using the API.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.340]   You'd have to give them your credentials.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.860]   Gina, why don't we do this?
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.740]   You and I will do this.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.820]   We'll write this.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.100]   I'm a little Python.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.500]   You're a little bit rock and roll.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.740]   It'll be great.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.420]   Yeah, just give me a username and password.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.860]   Do two-factor auth credentials.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.940]   And then what good to go?
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.580]   I'm done.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.020]   I need to give it access, obviously.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.340]   All right.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.820]   Here's another one from Cloud HQ.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.660]   This is great.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.740]   Chatroom, you're great for this kind of stuff.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:17.340]   CloudHQ.net synchronize how to synchronize Google Drive
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.220]   and Dropbox.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:19.940]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:26.660]   So this is a product, I guess, I gather that will do this.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.980]   Huh.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.940]   It will back it up to a variety of services.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.140]   Yeah, because the ideal is, it just does it for you.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.060]   So you never think--
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.620]   it's just like the essay I wrote about the death
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.780]   or control less.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.220]   I'm not saving that way anymore.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:40.940]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.220]   Who needs that?
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.340]   And so you want a backup that you don't ever
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.980]   have to think about, it's just there.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.980]   And yeah, you're paying for it for pure security.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.660]   You may never look at it for five years.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.100]   So CloudHQ does this between a variety of things.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.540]   Evernote, everybody, pretty much.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.220]   This is really interesting.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.620]   Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, Box, Evernote, OneDrive, OneDrive,
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.580]   Pro, SharePoint, Web Dev, which means--
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.100]   [SOUND]
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.540]   Web dev would be great, because then you
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.580]   could go to somebody and say, I want to set up a Web dev
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.580]   server on SoftLair, and then you'd own it,
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.100]   and it would be your private thing
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.580]   and it would automatically make.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.740]   SugarSync, which is a backup solution.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.820]   SugarSync might have a--
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.700]   let me see if SugarSync has a Google Drive solution.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.580]   So this is the only safety net that I think I would say.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.180]   If you had this, I would have no problem, Jeff.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.460]   Right.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:29.820]   None at all.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.260]   Right.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.980]   And then the presumption is that more and more--
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.780]   we're going to go to gig connectivity,
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.100]   and we're going to go to absolutely costless storage
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.580]   and processing with CloudHQ.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.620]   Yes, that's pretty obvious that that's going to happen.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.900]   So then your argument's about photo.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.340]   Why?
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.260]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.780]   There are certain things you need.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.460]   A lot of local storage and a lot of local CPU.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.220]   And among those are professional photo editing
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.260]   of Roth files, video--
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.540]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.500]   You're never--
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.060]   and the reason is not--
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.140]   of course, the Cloud servers will have more power
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.460]   than your local CPU.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.620]   It's the transporting large amounts of data back and forth
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.100]   that's required by this kind of stuff.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.700]   OK, but if it's a gig line.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.460]   Man, OK, maybe.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   Yeah, I mean, maybe down the road.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.780]   You're certainly not doable now.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.700]   The way it's in T.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.580]   And it doesn't make sense to do it now.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.060]   It's nutty to do it now.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.340]   I'm not saying that.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.380]   I'm just saying that.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.060]   Someday we go there.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.700]   I mean, when there's we video, you can't edit video now
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.780]   through the Cloud.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.860]   And the difference in video is you actually
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.220]   get an advantage because rendering locally
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.260]   on a slower processor--
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.900]   I agree 100% rendering now.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.980]   It's the transport of the data that is prohibited.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.580]   The difference here is you transport it once,
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.420]   and then you render every time on the Cloud.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.300]   You may be better off than having to render slowly locally.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.180]   No, I understand that argument.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.940]   Try it and you'll see why you don't want to--
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.020]   I know now, but again, I'm just saying--
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.780]   So go to the next incremental improvement.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.580]   Look, yeah.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.420]   And someday everything will be the size of a dot on your forehead,
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.500]   and you won't have to even have a keyboard.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.300]   But for right now, I wouldn't recommend that.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.460]   But the things that you do, which is writing,
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.740]   writing is very small amount of data.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   That's the same perfect.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.260]   I used to work on a green screen with a mono cursor.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.460]   I'm going to talk to my buddy at Carbonite and ask him,
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.540]   why don't you do this?
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.580]   Because this would be a great product.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.300]   It really would be a such a consumer product.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.060]   And there are a few--
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.860]   This Cloud HQ looks like it does.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.540]   It's like it's-- the personal plan is 100 bucks a year.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.980]   They don't say how much data.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.060]   But it will synchronize Google Drive.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.100]   They're not-- HQ is not storing this stuff.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:47.980]   It's just a transport.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.060]   It's a synchronization.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.060]   That's right.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.660]   It will transform.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.620]   So the data is not that--
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.460]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.700]   So you could say have one drive, the Microsoft Solution
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.220]   or Dropbox, and synchronize them.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.220]   That seems like--
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.020]   I'm going to try doing this because increasingly, everything
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.700]   I do is on the Cloud.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.700]   The other thing you're giving up is you don't--
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.580]   I mean, desktop word is, I think you could argue better
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.940]   than Google--
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.820]   the Google Word app or--
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.300]   But I don't edit it anymore.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.980]   The only time I would have to do it anymore.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.220]   I don't care at all about Word.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.380]   I don't use it at all.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.140]   I write entirely and drive now.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.100]   And I've seen advantages doing that, right?
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.380]   The versioning is automatic.
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.500]   The saving is automatic.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.020]   The functionality is easier.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.540]   I'm not doing fancy formatting, random writing text.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.980]   If I were doing fancy formatting,
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.620]   I'd be doing it in Quark or--
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.620]   Watch my call up.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.860]   InDesign.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.540]   InDesign, thank you.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.740]   But you can't do that without a desktop.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.300]   No.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.380]   If I were doing--
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:46.780]   Right.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.860]   Print.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.580]   Print.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.060]   Right?
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.340]   Where are we now?
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.380]   We're design is separate from content.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.660]   Presentation is separate from content.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.460]   That's what the web did.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.740]   So what you really care about is your underlying data,
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.700]   your content, and then design is a layer on top of that.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.060]   Well, as you said, there's a point
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.860]   where the phase change happens, where you no longer
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.100]   use illustrators, suddenly use photographers.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.620]   And we haven't quite come to--
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.660]   I think we might be at that point.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.060]   Maybe--
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.780]   We're at that point for--
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.620]   Right, for me, not for my video students.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.140]   Right?
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.340]   So we're at that point for writing, for transactions,
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.380]   for communication.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.740]   And it's happening very fast.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.860]   I mean, I think a lot of--
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.820]   I mean, it wasn't--
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.500]   every time I said two years ago, forget physical media.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.220]   You will no longer be buying DVDs or Blu-rays or--
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.820]   people still yell at me when I say that.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.100]   But it's true.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.300]   It's true.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.340]   For all but the most audio file or video file, people
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.900]   still like Blu-ray.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.380]   I just want to know that I am living.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.460]   Good, la vida, cloudy.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.220]   You are.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.940]   I mean, Jeff, you've been fixing to make this transition
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:58.500]   for a while.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.700]   I think at this point, it makes sense for you
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.060]   to just drop the default assumption
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.220]   that you have to have a Mac.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:06.740]   You buy.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.220]   I'd say just don't buy a Mac.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.820]   And look, worse comes to worse.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.540]   You need something you need a Mac for you.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.020]   Go to an Apple store and buy a Mac.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.900]   But see how long you go.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.580]   I'll be interested.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.380]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.860]   I think you don't need to.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:25.940]   My aunt was born one with what was it, $64K in 1981 costs,
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.460]   I think, $3,500.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.340]   $84.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.380]   Jeff, this is a momentous moment.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.980]   You have bought your last--
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.580]   It is.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.340]   I think so.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.660]   Now here's the question, Leo.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.540]   Here's the question.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.740]   What happens when you get pissy and you start cursing,
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.220]   be coming in on Hangout and set us up?
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.220]   Well, we have to live with that.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.260]   Hangout's going to get better, I hope.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.020]   WebRTC, I'll get better, I hope.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.500]   You're doing it for the show, Jeff.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.620]   I wish you could go on totally--
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.940]   Jeff, is that are we OK with it?
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.500]   I mean, he's on Hangouts now, right?
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.500]   Yeah, the one--
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.580]   The one issue that we're having-- and it's on our end--
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.180]   I think we need to upgrade our processor here.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.380]   Because Hangouts for some reason does not--
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.540]   Frame me is not great.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.260]   Yeah, and you can see it.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.780]   And this is my assumption here.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.180]   I'll bring this back up here.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.340]   And this is what I assume is happening,
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.940]   is that our processors are just getting maxed right now.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.940]   Yeah, all four of them.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.220]   Just because Hangouts-- whoa, I don't know what is going on there.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.380]   Wow.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.380]   But yeah.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.020]   Oh, wow, yeah.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:27.780]   They are pegs.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.380]   Look at that.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.140]   Jesus.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.980]   And see that.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.500]   So I mean, that was a very quick--
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.500]   it could be some other issue, but that was--
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.460]   my quick diagnostic was that, for some reason, Hangouts
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.100]   is using up tons of CPU usage.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.180]   The other issue is that--
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.780]   It may actually use all it can get.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.460]   So it may be--
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.860]   Well, if it's doing that, it's still the frame rates real bad.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.900]   It's still not great.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.140]   Yeah, and that's the next issue.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.980]   The other problem I have is that I paid for the 50--
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.820]   that's looking at--
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.660]   --negs of Verizon service.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.380]   Jesus is only about 50%.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.900]   And they give me 25.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   So I've got to call them--
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.940]   this is what I was talking about in the last week.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.740]   I have to take the breath at a day to go full.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.300]   I forgot to say I'm paying you for this.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.260]   You know, I give you a two-week--
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.260]   I don't want to have to do--
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.060]   Tomorrow's my day off.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.940]   It's Comcast Day.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.220]   Oh, man.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:19.900]   Comcast Day.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.180]   Friday?
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.700]   Oh, Friday.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.620]   I just did the same thing to upgrade mine.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.420]   But--
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.100]   And kind of--
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.860]   --because it's going to equal up and down.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.420]   So I'll have 50-- when they give me what I pay for,
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.100]   I'll have 50 up, but 50 down.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.780]   You know, increasingly, my calendar, my to-do list,
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.900]   my phone book--
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:41.940]   this is all in the cloud.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.780]   I have to say this--
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.980]   This isn't actually-- actually, well--
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.740]   no, I am going to have one day going to the DMV
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.860]   and one day for Comcast.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.540]   Hey, you want to go to the DMV together?
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.100]   Because I need to go to the DMV, too.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.700]   Let's go to the DMV together.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.100]   OK.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.060]   We'll make it a day.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.700]   It's like saying, I got to put aside a day for a root canal.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.940]   So we'll get breakfast, go to the DMV,
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:02.820]   and then get dinner.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.340]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:03.820]   OK.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.820]   Great.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.580]   Good.
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.860]   I decided with Comcast, I'm going to go to the store.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.660]   I've decided that of all the options--
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.660]   phone, chat, store--
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.180]   You can stare at somebody.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.820]   There-- I think the store is the best.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.300]   I've always had the best service in the store,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.940]   because, yeah, because you're actually looking at them.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.420]   You're looking at the person, yeah.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.300]   The only problem I've had, Leo, is I've gone into the store.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   I'm going to bring a box of chocolates.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.100]   They're not the best at the whole system sometimes,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.260]   so they will mess up something else in your account.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.420]   Well, that could happen with anybody.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.100]   My experience with the store is they're usually
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.860]   pretty the most competent in the people.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.420]   And they're nice.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.260]   And you've got to face them.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:37.780]   And they're nice.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.940]   And you're going to block the chocolates.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.300]   I've had great results in the store.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.900]   So I think that's what I'm going to do is go to, hey,
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.580]   I just want to add Turner Classic movies.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.460]   Can you help me?
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.900]   And then we'll see.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.660]   Should I record it?
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.900]   Where you go to glass?
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.740]   Hey, you know what?
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.540]   That's called defensive Google Glass, where you don't use it,
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.020]   but you just wear it.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.380]   The threat that I might be recording this.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.300]   Right, observer effect.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.900]   You kind of need to always think the observer effect upon them.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.460]   You got to think that Comcast particularly right now,
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.260]   they're very sensitive.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.300]   So if you start at any Comcast conversation with,
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.060]   do you mind if I record this?
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.780]   You'd probably get better service.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.820]   I saw Craig Newmark yesterday at an event here in New York.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.020]   You're a wonderful, amazing, delightful Craig.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.060]   Sweet guy.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.980]   He pulled out from his pocket--
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.820]   I hope I'm not telling the historian at a school, Craig--
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.860]   pulled out from his pocket because he watches Twig.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.980]   He pulled out his pocket a Verizon executive's business
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.900]   card.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.460]   And he said, I just saw this person this morning.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.940]   They're aware of you.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.420]   Oh, dear.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.740]   Oh, dear.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.460]   Oh, dear.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.460]   That could be a mixed bag.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.300]   This is--
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.060]   Oh, dear.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.060]   Awesome.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.060]   They're aware.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.540]   Don't have my How By The X-A-7 with me.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.460]   They were kind of like, oh, is that the X-A-7?
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.580]   Is this the one?
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.940]   It's going to have to go to a museum.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.420]   White.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:56.940]   All right, so--
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.420]   They're on the blacklist.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.020]   Normally, we'll do news on this show.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.780]   And there's actually a good amount of Google News,
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.380]   but none of it really got us excited.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.780]   So what I might just do is run down the headlines.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.620]   And if either of you have anything to say, just throw it in.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.220]   How about that?
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:14.300]   And then we still want to do the change log.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.180]   I think we've decided no more computers for Jeff.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.580]   When did you buy your first personal computer, Jeff?
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.860]   My Osborne 1 and 1981.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.020]   So you know what?
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.340]   It's been 33 years.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:28.940]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.500]   I think it's time to stop.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.260]   Stop the madness.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.860]   Nalil, when was the last time--
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.820]   I'll ask it this way first.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.380]   When was the last time you did serious photo editing?
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.220]   Oh, I do it every day.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.020]   Not every day, but I do it frequently.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.620]   You really do.
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.940]   The most recent one I put on Plus, Lisa got her--
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.900]   Not Plus.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.500]   No, no, no, no.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.740]   But I-- no, so Lisa--
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.020]   Like that he posted it.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.820]   I posted it on Plus.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.900]   Lisa got her 49er season tickets.
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.860]   So I took photos with my 5D in camera
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.860]   and I got a RAW.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.460]   So these are 30 or 40 megabyte files.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.460]   That's a beautiful--
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:08.980]   It was all--
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.220]   It imported into Lightroom,
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.860]   processed it in Lightroom,
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.900]   uploaded it to Google and posted it.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.380]   It's a wonderful photo, Leah.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.580]   But with all respect,
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.020]   would your phone have done that much of a different job
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.580]   with those kinds of photos?
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.820]   See, Jeff, this is why you can live in the cloud
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.140]   because you can't tell the difference.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.780]   No, I'm saying--
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.340]   If you're doing your Hawaii landscape--
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.980]   No, I'm telling you, Jeff,
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.980]   you can't tell the difference.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.540]   That's why you can live in the cloud.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.900]   Believe me, my phone cannot do this.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.420]   OK, fine.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.460]   All right, that's what I'm asking.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.740]   All right.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:45.260]   All right.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:45.780]   Gina.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.820]   Gina, it's really interesting.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.940]   Like, I'm of two minds--
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.460]   I think about this in the context of, you know,
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.700]   what kind of computers is Edna gonna use.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.940]   How am I gonna introduce my daughter to computers?
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.060]   She's one, OK?
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.340]   And I realize that, you know, on one hand,
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.900]   I want to build a PC with her.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.820]   I want her to understand how to snap, you know,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.020]   the ram onto the motherboard.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.180]   And I want to know what it is like to buy a case
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.140]   and put a computer together, because I want her to understand
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.660]   what's going on underneath.
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.700]   On the other hand, most likely--
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.980]   I mean, first of all, she's already started to use my phone,
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.260]   right?
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.140]   So she's already been introduced to her first computer.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.220]   She picks up my phone and goes like this.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.860]   It means that I want you to start my app,
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.340]   because she's got like a little toddler lock app.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.420]   On the other hand, I think I'm gonna get her phones
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.020]   and tablets and Chromebooks, right?
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.820]   Absolutely.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.220]   She is never gonna have a PC.
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.140]   You don't think she's ever gonna have a PC?
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.860]   I mean, that's my point.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.940]   That's my point, Gina.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.700]   By the time we, of course, edit is gonna come on,
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.980]   you know, Jake was starting to be three years old.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:40.980]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.420]   I-- the big moment in our family was when we thought that we had
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.660]   to take Jake through living--
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.900]   Bill Gross's magnificent living books.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.180]   And we had to, you know, do this for him.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.860]   He'd say, point it that we'd go click on it,
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.540]   because this mouse was really complicated.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.780]   Then my parents went up with him.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.700]   Of course, they didn't know what the FM mouse was.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.900]   We just grabbed something from him and started doing it.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.900]   Right.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.900]   He's like, yeah, let me show you this.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.900]   Right.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.900]   Right.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.820]   So Ed is gonna be using things and creating things.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.820]   There's great-- there's-- I forget what the name of it is.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.540]   There's a programming app for kids that's called Turtle
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.740]   Something Intribute as an homage to the old Turtle MIT stuff.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.740]   That's really wonderful.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.220]   And there's great stuff.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.980]   Yeah, but she'll be creating and doing phenomenal things
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.540]   without the need for this notion of a computer.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.100]   It's like saying, "Son, you're early on a know-how
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.100]   carburetor works."
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.100]   What?
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.100]   Yeah, I know.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.100]   I know.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.380]   I just-- I learned a lot of patience.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.740]   I learned a lot about computers by building one myself, by installing
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:44.140]   windows, you know, from scratch, by googling, what the hell is this
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.980]   DLL, and how do I fix it?
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.980]   Editing the registry.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   I don't know.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.740]   I know this is really old school stuff, but like this was like me
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.740]   figuring out--
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.740]   No, it was you.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.380]   And also, I don't know if you're figuring that out, is gaining the confidence that
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.500]   I can fix anything that happens that comes my way, because I've
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.900]   fixed so many things to begin with.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.820]   And I think, like, so to give her a tablet or to say, you know, you've just got
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.820]   Chrome, right?
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.420]   You've just got access to these web apps.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.900]   And if the web app is down or if you run into an error, there's nothing you could do,
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.900]   because that's all that is that I'm here.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.900]   That's not what I was saying.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.820]   She doesn't have to-- she doesn't have to put in the motherboard.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.820]   Know how to do that.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.820]   Right.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.820]   Right.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.820]   Right.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.340]   I mean, listen, I ordered a Heathkit Ham radio once.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.340]   Mm-hmm.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.340]   Am I less--
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.340]   Right, for fun.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:32.220]   Because, because, you know, I don't know how to fix a radio and put a new tube in, you
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.220]   know, and that things change.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   Oh, I love the--
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   I love the--
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.220]   I love the--
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.220]   She's going to need-- no code.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.220]   She's going to need no Python.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.220]   She's going to need no REST APIs.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220]   That's the new building--
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.220]   I love the key that the new board--
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.220]   --a computer.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.220]   She's--
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.220]   No, that's true.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.220]   Rest APIs.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.220]   Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.220]   That's the REST APIs.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.220]   She's sort of the name of the client.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.300]   She's getting an Angular.js and no.js.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:56.420]   She's going to-- those are the bits and pieces that are the Heathkit of the future software.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   It's not hardware.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.420]   Hardware, commoditized.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.420]   It's a done deal.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   It's done.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.420]   OK, that I accept.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   And that's fine.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.420]   You know what?
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:09.140]   A great thing to teach her Python, and when she's six, hell yeah.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:14.060]   Well, it even goes back to the full square, as old as we are, is you had-- what did you
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.340]   do in the original days of computing?
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.060]   You went to the lab and you got time on the mainframe.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   Right.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:25.780]   Now, everybody has time on the mainframe, as much time as they want.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   Sorry.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.060]   Oh, you, it was afraid of me.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.060]   I was shot at the chat.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:33.180]   I had already pulled on my headphones because Jeff was talking to me, so I couldn't tell
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.500]   that you were talking off Mike.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.860]   I thought you were talking on Mike.
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.180]   Shat and a chat.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.900]   That lower third overlay problem, apparently.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.900]   Right, I fixed it.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.940]   Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't teach a kid how to build a crystal radio set.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.340]   You wouldn't teach-- I mean, it might be fun.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:52.020]   And there is this whole make movement that is really retro in many respects, and I don't
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.460]   have anything wrong with that.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.620]   But really, if you're saying, well, from a practical point of view, what are the building
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.620]   bollocks of the future?
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.620]   Well, I don't--
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.620]   It's code.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:04.020]   They ordered Bill Gross's $200 or $300, whatever it is, his 3D printer.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.020]   He has an amazing--
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.500]   --you can really reduce the price of a 3D printer phenomenally.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   So what's ended going to do?
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.980]   Ed is going to be able to do CAD software to make things that she can make physically
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.980]   in the 3D printer and make them fit together and do things with them.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.980]   And jeez, it's that Pete's hat-- heaf kits.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.780]   Yeah, that's fair.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.780]   That's fair.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.780]   That's a good project, that Google Project project.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.140]   The one with the snap-- the phone that snaps together with the different components.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.900]   I mean, I guess that's similar to putting together a PC.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.140]   It's just smaller and--
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.900]   Well, the other thing too is we learn different ways.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.220]   The story I always tell about Jakin programming is that I thought you had to learn those charts
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.700]   with the diamonds and the arrows, and you had to plan everything out because every developer
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.900]   says you've got to know everything before you do it.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.900]   And what do you do?
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.900]   Hey, time has come.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.620]   You told him how to dig into a program, tear it apart, put it back together, see what worked.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.620]   That's the way you learn.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.620]   Time's change.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:38:59.620]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.620]   It's true.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.620]   I accept that.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.620]   All right, listen, don't buy a Mac.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.700]   I want to see if you ever come to a place where you say, OK, I have to give in.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.620]   And I'm glad-- I'm actually glad Jeff that you raised this issue because I think you're
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.620]   absolutely right.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.180]   I don't think you-- I think it's-- the time has come.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.660]   It really-- it should occur to me.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.900]   It was a step change in cloud world.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.860]   Now, I'm going to continue to buy computers because of the stuff I do, I need a computer.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.740]   But I'm sure that time will come for me at some point, too.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:30.060]   Well, the problem is for you, then they'll go half your shows.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.060]   Sorry.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.580]   No, that's fine.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.580]   We'll move on.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.780]   We'll do more code.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:37.780]   I mean, code's exciting.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.140]   I-- frankly, I'd prefer to talk about code.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.060]   I think that's much more interesting.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.060]   And it's very similar.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.980]   I've been back in the day when I started watching Twitch.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:53.660]   And you guys would start launching into specs of a monitor-- a new monitor is out.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.660]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   Right?
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.660]   And--
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.500]   Well, you're not a computer enthusiast.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.900]   No, no, no, I'm not that way.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.740]   But I'm saying, even now, we don't care anymore.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.940]   Well, some do.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.940]   Some do.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.420]   But not to the detail that we used to.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.420]   You know, it's very much like stereo equipment.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:12.340]   Remember how in the year old enough, I'm old enough to remember where there were people
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.740]   who were just really into stereo equipment.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.300]   And the fact-- the music they were listening to was totally secondary to the fact that
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.540]   they built the perfect stereo.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.260]   And if they listened to music, it was the 1812 Overture because the cannons and the
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:31.460]   bells were really a good test of the subwoofers on their-- on their clipshorns.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.260]   And there were stereo magazines, how to build stereo.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:40.780]   People talked about total harmonic distortion and RMS wattage.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.700]   And it was-- you know, then there came a time-- and I think it happened in the '60s
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.020]   when Rolling Stone came out, where the content became more important than the hardware.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.740]   And that happens over and over and over and over and over.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.300]   Let me play to your point, though, in a different way.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.140]   Right, so my father was not a mechanic.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.900]   I'll tell you this way.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.060]   Confession moment.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.940]   So for my sixth grade science fair, which I won, I built electronic bongos.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:07.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.940]   I love it.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.940]   What does that mean?
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.940]   What do they do?
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.940]   I don't tell me.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:19.260]   It was little egg cups with metal, and you could tap them and it just caused the amplifier
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.660]   to go being like a drum.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:21.660]   But it was a kit.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.660]   It was not a kit.
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.660]   It was instructions.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.660]   And I built it.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.660]   And I did the chart about why it worked this way and all this kind of stuff.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.660]   But I had to build the amp.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.020]   Or I had to take an old radio amp and put it in a new case and a new speaker had to
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.020]   build that.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.860]   And the thing was just tilted every which way.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.820]   It was as if designed by Escher.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.300]   Right?
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.700]   And my father-- this is kind of a Howard Stern moment.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.460]   My father came down and said, you're so clumsy.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.420]   You couldn't stick your finger up your-- with your hand.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.420]   It's mean.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.420]   It was.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.420]   It explains a lot about me.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.940]   This reminds me of last week's Masters of Sex.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.740]   It's all about the mean daddy.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.820]   Did you watch it last week?
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.060]   One of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.060]   Really good.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.460]   Well, most of it takes place in a hotel room.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.060]   Yeah, it's really good.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.060]   And the back drop is--
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.660]   And I fall in love with her.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.660]   Jesus.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.660]   Oh my god, yeah.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.820]   Well, I loved her from day one.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.740]   Yeah, she's gorgeous.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.740]   Lizzy Kaplan.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.740]   Lizzy Kaplan just won.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.820]   Anyway, so my father and I never went and tore apart cars and did all that.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.820]   Right?
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.820]   Let's say that you did.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.980]   Let's just see who you did.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.540]   So he was-- was he mechanical or no?
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.540]   He was an engineer.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   He's an engineer by training.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.540]   Okay.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.540]   But he liked electrical engineer.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.700]   So he wasn't a grease kind of engineer, no physical.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.300]   Anyway, so Edda.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.860]   So let's say that Edda enjoys physical engineering.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.740]   She's not going to build a Google self-driving car because it's too complex.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.540]   It's too delicate.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:54.900]   It's-- you know, you're not going to-- yeah, maybe you can plug in some things to it.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.020]   But these days with cars, a lot of us run by computers.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.340]   That chance of really being able to run the thing is gone, Gina.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.340]   You're right.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.340]   And there is something lost there.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.780]   I'm not denying that.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.780]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.780]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.940]   But Edda's going to have so much more fun.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:10.940]   She is.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.620]   She's going to-- and I'm going to have a lot of fun.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.620]   It just changes.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.900]   You know, there's a guy-- and there's a guy who said, I didn't tune into this show to
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:17.900]   be less techy.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.900]   This is not less techy.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.900]   No, no.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   If you're a hardware fan, this is very disruptive to you.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.540]   And hardware doesn't go away, by the way.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.540]   Hardware persists.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.540]   Hardware has to.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.540]   Servers and all of that.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.300]   And there'll be plenty of people who build servers and all of that.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.380]   But what happens is the mainstream of technology moves into software.
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.460]   And I think that that's been coming for a long time.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.780]   That's-- Gina, I think you'll back this up.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.780]   Software's where it's at.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.980]   Here's my prediction.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.380]   Edda's revolt is going to be that she goes to Renaissance fairs and ends up carrying nothing
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   about technology.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.020]   Just play the flute.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.860]   I'm going to be making buggy whips.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.860]   It's the future.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.860]   I'm going to be like, are you excited?
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.700]   The FCC approved this GPS chip that I could just embed onto your skin.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.140]   And now we can always be in touch.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.140]   Like nope.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.540]   Nope, I'll take my spiral notebook and append.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.540]   I'm going to--
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.940]   I got an all-us technology.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:11.940]   Ruin the world.
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.100]   I got to tell you that, though.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.660]   Neither of my kids is technical.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:20.460]   They both use computers, but neither of them is like our geeky.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.460]   And I wouldn't count on it as being anything that you want her to be.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.460]   Let's put it that way.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.460]   Yeah, no.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.460]   You're right.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.460]   You're right.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.660]   And certainly the novelty of it isn't going to be there for her the way that it was for
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.660]   us.
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.660]   Right?
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.660]   Because it's not new.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.620]   I mean, it's just going to be around.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.100]   There's going to be part of her life.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.180]   Well, I wish the happiest day of my life was in Henry said, hey, can you teach me how
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.180]   to hack?
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180]   And I said, great.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.700]   We're going to start with-- let's start with Python.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.540]   And then he said, no.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.580]   I just want to get into my grades and change them.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:53.020]   Well, you've got to learn code for-- oh, no.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.020]   It's too much.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.020]   Well, I just wasted everything.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.820]   My father loved golf.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.980]   And he tried to get me out the golf.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.980]   I hated golf.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.180]   And it all ended once on the driving range.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:06.340]   When I ended up pulling back by driver and hitting him in the shin, accidentally, very
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.700]   clear because I'm clumsy.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.380]   And that was kind of-- and then he ended up hitting me in the head with a ball off a
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.380]   drive.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.380]   And I didn't do that.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.580]   So I got one.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.820]   A good walk ruined.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.860]   All right.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.900]   Here are the headlines.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:29.660]   According to the cable companies, it's not the cable companies that threaten net neutrality.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.660]   It's go goal.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.660]   That's pretty ridiculous.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.060]   This is classic reversal, but I still don't understand what their argument was.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:43.100]   In a filing to the FTC, Time Warner Cable says the controversy over internet providers
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:48.060]   charging websites for access to special fast lanes is a quote, "red herring."
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.060]   The real danger is that Google or Netflix could demand payments from them.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:57.180]   See, they live in the cable world, which is exactly how that works, by the way.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.580]   And they think that Google is going to put up a paywall for them, which is absurd.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.380]   They're living in the past.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:09.200]   They're living in the days where you pay HBO to carry HBO on your cable company and then
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.220]   charge the customer.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.500]   And that was how the financials all worked.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.500]   Right.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.100]   It's not going to happen because Google's like a set of a paywall.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   No.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.100]   No.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.100]   I hope.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.100]   No.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   No.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.100]   No.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.100]   Not their business model.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.420]   It's really a very old-fashioned way of looking at things.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.580]   This is, by the way, what's happened now with a debate.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.140]   And I'm not sure exactly what to think about it.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:38.140]   We were talking about it on the security now, the debate between level three and Verizon
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.780]   over who's causing the congestion.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.580]   And Verizon says, "Well, it's Netflix/level three.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.700]   They're carriers fault because you're pumping.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.700]   It's all asymmetric.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.220]   You're pumping so much data one way."
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.980]   And so it's not really a peer relationship in the sense that we're symmetrically sending
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.540]   data back and forth.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:00.180]   So we want money from you because it's not, and that's how hearing works.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.980]   And I don't know what a good argument against that is.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.380]   But Netflix is just to deal with AT&T.
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.380]   You know what?
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.380]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.380]   Yeah, they're going to do deals.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.660]   It's all with the cable companies R&D charging for service.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:20.580]   GoogleX has a new project to collect anonymous genetic and molecular info from people to
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.700]   help detect disease earlier.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.940]   This is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:33.820]   What actually about this one was that Google XLab really is the closest thing we have,
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.340]   I think, to Bell Labs.
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.340]   You bet.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.340]   Right.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.340]   It's better.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.060]   Yeah, it's not as big.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.140]   Yeah, I think it's better than Bell Labs.
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.220]   So that's what I wanted to talk about.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.220]   So how?
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.340]   Well, Bell Labs was very much focused on AT&T.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.660]   What technologies could make AT&T money, I think, always.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.660]   Unix, Unix.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.660]   Oh, no.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:54.660]   Well, no.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.660]   They did things.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.540]   They did pure research, things that they didn't know were going to have an impact on
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.540]   them.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.540]   Give me an example.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.940]   There's even an argument that Unix wasn't going to be terribly useful to them.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.100]   Because Unix is probably one of the Bell Labs invented the transistor.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.100]   They invented Unix.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.740]   They invented so much of the technology that we used to.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.860]   They did a lot of astronomy and weird stuff.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.860]   Okay.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.420]   It seems like Google's even going farther afield.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:24.660]   I mean, Google's business has nothing to do with autonomous vehicles or the human body.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.100]   This reminds me of 23 in me in some ways.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.620]   The baseline study will collect anonymous genetic and molecular information from 175
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:37.220]   people initially later, thousands more to create a picture of what a healthy human looks
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.220]   like.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:44.340]   It's being led by a 50-year-old molecular biologist named Andrew Conrad.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:49.380]   He joined Google X in March of 2013, 70 to 100 experts.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:53.420]   I think this is a larian Sergey, a little bit more open to the idea of putting money
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.900]   in for, I think, for the public.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   I think it's right there.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.900]   But it's also smaller.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.900]   Now the question, I live near the old Bell Labs.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.900]   And it's...
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.900]   Is it massive?
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:03.900]   One of two major facilities.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   And it's phenomenal.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.900]   It's huge.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.700]   The parking lot is just empty now.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.100]   And it's quite sad because so much happened there.
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.020]   It was phenomenal.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.980]   Does Google X have to be as big as Bell Labs?
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.500]   Do you need as many scientists to do things?
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.340]   Is it more distributed?
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.420]   If Google is our most successful technology company, as AT&T was in the time, and they're
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:32.060]   doing this for society and for the future, which I believe they are, is Google X big
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.060]   enough?
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.420]   Some people complain it's too big.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.020]   They're doing too much crazy stuff.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.580]   But maybe they're not doing enough.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.580]   I don't know.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:45.180]   In 1857, maybe you saw this in school, HEMO the Magnificent.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.820]   This is from Bell Labs.
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.020]   You wouldn't see this in school today.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.780]   They're quoting Leviticus.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.780]   No.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.620]   This is 1957.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.940]   I guess they did a series of educational videos.
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.460]   So that doesn't help AT&T.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:02.300]   No, they did a lot of stuff like that.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.380]   No, I didn't get a lot of it when they...
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:06.380]   Wow.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.420]   When they rolled the projector into class, weren't you happy?
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.180]   Oh, they had major Hollywood movie stars in there.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.180]   Yes.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.180]   They did.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.180]   Love the movies.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.180]   I know you keep explaining to me that this is a picture of a whole...
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.180]   ...but more now.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.180]   Let's get cracking with this.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.180]   Look, this is the film from my science screen.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.180]   Take care of it and keep it in focus with it.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.180]   Alright, guys, let's get set for a rehearsal.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.180]   Everything works as time, boys.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.580]   This is like a real Hollywood movie.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.580]   Wow.
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.580]   My magic screen film will set up, Jim.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.620]   Well, the screen is ready.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.060]   What's his name, the guy on the right?
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.380]   Oh, I get a great character actor I can't remember.
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:40.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.580]   Fiction and science.
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.780]   That's a pretty good team.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.780]   Say, what's the big show about today?
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.180]   HEMO the Magnificent.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   HEMO.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.180]   HEMO.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.980]   That's Greek for blood.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.080]   Oh, blood.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   This was entertaining to us, Gina.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.080]   Well, don't get any on you.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.080]   Well, actually, just not having to do classwork was I...
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.080]   Just so I think we could watch TV.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.580]   Yeah, I think he was the voice of Winnie the Poop, but I'm trying to place his name.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.080]   Wait, do you see what I've got?
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080]   Charim will tell us.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.080]   And who's that guy?
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.580]   No, he's his far too young.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.580]   He's a movie star.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:16.080]   Come on, magic screen.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.080]   Magic screen?
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.080]   See, it's in the cloud.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   Hey, what's going on here?
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   Well, that's Mel Black.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.080]   So they really...
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.780]   I mean, this is big bucks.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.780]   And you can...
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:37.680]   I think you can safely say that this is not a moneymaker free D&D.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   I don't understand.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.880]   This is an educational video about blood.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.880]   There was a whole...
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.680]   There was a whole series of these.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   There were quite a few of them.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   Wow.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.280]   So, you know, Google is doing this.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.280]   Dirling Holloway, is that right?
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   Is that who that is?
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   Maybe.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   I might spend the other part of this.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   Like, I read this article about Google doing this and I think why is Google doing this?
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   Why isn't a medical...
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.080]   I mean, I know that Larry and Sergey are particularly kind of obsessed with health issues because
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.880]   I forget which one of them has the predictor gene for some disease.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.180]   I forget which, but I don't know.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.980]   And I think that their intentions are good.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.960]   And of course, the state is being collected, you know, anonymously and all that.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:20.520]   But I just wonder, it just seems like whenever they do projects like this that involve massive
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.040]   amounts of data collection and of course data analysis and data collection is what Google
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.840]   is good at, but there's always that question of what are they doing with it and their privacy
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   concerns.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.680]   And I know, I know, Jeff, like they shouldn't be, but there are.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   And I just...
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   They're all just working through more.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   And I just...
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:38.200]   It makes me worried that they're going to do more harm than good, you know, like because
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.880]   the headline is, you know, why does Google...
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.760]   Why is Google, you know, indexing your DNA?
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   Well, in fact, the MIT Technology Review, Antonio Regolado writing says Google X's project
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.160]   to study human health, that's no Apollo 11.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.560]   It's a secret lab.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.960]   He really poo-poos this.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.160]   It says it is in a moonshot.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.640]   I mean, come on.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.120]   It seems like, I mean, we can be...
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   But I think...
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:15.200]   I think it's got a really important point here, which... and I believe that these guys really
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.040]   mean it, that health data should be open for the good of all.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.040]   It's a cause for them.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.040]   Yes.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.480]   And you're right, Gina.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.960]   There's a risk that if they mess this up, then they ruin their own cause.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.720]   But if they do it right, we are limiting the knowledge that we have.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.240]   We're losing lives because we don't know enough.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:38.920]   And it is Google the best organization to do this.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.520]   I guess is my question.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.320]   I wonder if Google's the right...
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.720]   Well, okay.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.200]   So there's an interesting argument here.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.960]   You remember the Human Genome Project, the project to map the genome?
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:56.120]   There were public sector scientists working on this, and there were corporate people working
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   on it.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.360]   And it was the corporate people who solved it very quickly, very much quicker than anybody
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.280]   thought.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.920]   And I think at that point, it opened people's eyes to the fact that this could be done in
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.600]   the private sector.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.680]   And of course, there was some incentive to do map the genome because maybe you could patent
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.440]   it.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.680]   There is a project that's been going on for considerably longer, the personal genome project.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.560]   I tried to get in on this.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:26.240]   Esther Dyson is one of the people who has donated her data to this.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.600]   This is from Harvard.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.840]   So this is a public sector.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:39.240]   And they've collected, I think, both the genome and the medical information for something like
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.800]   100 people, or this was the plan.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.760]   And the whole deal with this, and the reason it was very difficult, and I've asked a participant
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.560]   and have not been invited, is because you had to be willing to give...
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.560]   I mean, there was no privacy involved.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.760]   In order for this to work, you had a consent that your name would be...
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.400]   They said, "Well, you're not going to be able to keep this private."
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:04.720]   So your name will be known, your phenotype, your genotype, everything will be public.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.920]   Researchers will have access to it, and there you go.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.520]   And because you can't keep this private, if you're going to participate, you should understand
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.520]   that.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:19.280]   I was talking to Esther Dyson about this issue once, and I said, "Well, I suppose, Esther,
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.560]   by talking about my prostate cancer, reveals it in my own son's genomes."
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.120]   He said, "Oh, Jarvis, get over it.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.120]   Everybody gets prostate cancer."
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.880]   That's true, eventually.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:33.800]   George Church is doing this, and I talked to George on our show, Futures and Biotech,
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:38.240]   some years ago, and I tried to get in on this, and I think it's a great thing.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.680]   And I just don't know if you sign up, you agree to pay for the tests, which are several
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:50.160]   thousand dollars, and I wanted to do it because I felt like this would be a contribution.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.920]   You have to do extensive medical questionnaires, because they're trying to match your genotype
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.080]   with your history.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.080]   It's great.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   It's great.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.400]   And this is totally for the public good.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.240]   And I think somewhat similar to what Google's up to.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:07.720]   I went to the privacy event, the all-hands privacy event at Google about two or three
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.640]   months ago, and the guy, I think his name is Mikey Dickerson.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.720]   He's a site reliability engineer at Google, chat room, maybe no, and tell me if I'm getting
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.720]   his name wrong.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.880]   But he was the guy who went off to rescue Obamacare's technology, along with a few others,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.880]   but he was the main guy.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:29.000]   And he came back and he gave a really, really eloquent, wonderful talk about having a lack
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.280]   of what a lack of knowledge has done through history of health.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:39.800]   And the classic example is Stephen Johnson's retelling of, was it typhoid?
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.320]   Yeah, the water.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   The water.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   The one well in London.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   The tainted water, yeah.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   The tainted water, right?
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.960]   It was knowledge that cured that.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960]   Yes.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.520]   It's data that cures that.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:57:00.040]   And keeping that data private, still seeing illnesses, something to be ashamed of, something
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:06.280]   to be punished in society so that people do hide it is only going to hurt us.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.600]   And yes, if you have Ebola, there's a reason that we want to keep you off and keep you
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.040]   separately and the family, you know, adapt that victim.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.840]   And that's not good for society either.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:21.200]   And I understand that there are still always going to be strictures about health information.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.840]   But in general, more information is good, full stop.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.360]   You could misuse it about privacy.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.000]   You could misuse it in bad science.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.160]   But to choose to have less information is insane on its face.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.160]   So I think it makes sense of Google.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:44.960]   I think who's better to gather and analyze large amounts of data at a consumer level?
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.440]   You know, who's better at it?
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.680]   No, level the NSA, but I don't want them to.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.120]   Well, but then there are people who equate the Google with the NSA, just the private
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.560]   sector version of the NSA.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.040]   All right, let's say this is a good conversation.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.720]   We could talk so much more about all of this stuff, but I think it's time to play the drums,
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.560]   play the trumpets, play the horns, put Gina Trippani to work because it's time for the
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.800]   Google change log.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.800]   Google change log.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:14.160]   What's new with the goog?
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.440]   Gina has the latest.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.840]   Google Maps got a pretty big update or a new feature on iOS and Android.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.320]   It's the new explore feature.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:29.200]   I don't know if you've gotten this already on your phone, Leo.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.080]   So you launch Google Maps on your phone and there's a brand new button on the bottom right,
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.920]   and it's the explore nearby button.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:39.800]   And you tap that and Google looks at the time of day and the weather and your location,
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:45.120]   and it basically just recommends like what's the nearest best thing kind of nearby, very
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:50.920]   similar to four square, clearly using your social connections.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:57.440]   It'll tell you from your circles who has gone places or raided things.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.600]   It's pretty nice.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:03.800]   So the new feature expands Google Maps is more than just kind of a directions app.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.960]   It'll make suggestions for you and adjust the results on context.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.120]   I do have it.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:13.560]   So it's next to the bullseye that says pinpoint where I am, there's a new button that has
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.520]   a little up in, dropped into a circle.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:20.440]   And if I tap that, it says here's what's near you within a 10 minute walk.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.600]   It says it's the afternoon.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.920]   It's 88 degrees.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.440]   Here's some quick bites, Mary's Pizza Shack.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:32.120]   There's some parks, here's ice cream, tea houses, bakeries, and they think I'm a fat
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.120]   so.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.520]   Where's the nearest gym?
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.800]   Here's some zagat stuff.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.600]   This is, I'm glad to see the gap.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   It's on the maps.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.960]   It's like, it's literally, it's a new button right on the interface.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.520]   It's not even buried in the menu.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.520]   No maps.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.720]   No maps.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.000]   But it is kind of now-ish, isn't it?
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   It is kind of now.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.040]   And I was saying on all of it, Android, last night, it's great.
[00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.400]   I normally would use four square for this kind of thing, but I went to explore near my
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.400]   office.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.840]   My office isn't kind of like an industrial area in Brooklyn and there's not a lot of
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.160]   lunch options.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.440]   And it actually found a place that I hadn't heard of before that I wound up saying, oh
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.680]   I'm going to check this out.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.640]   So it's pretty good.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.800]   Lots of images, lots of ratings.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.440]   And it takes the consideration open and close times.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.600]   I believe it does not recommend places that are not open at the moment that you're checking.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.600]   So it's pretty good.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.600]   This is sweet.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   That's the future.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.880]   You know, my favorite thing that Google does to me now?
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880]   What?
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.760]   On Saturdays, only on Saturdays.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.560]   In my Google now, it tells me how long it takes to get to Bridgewater Commons.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.560]   The reason is because on Saturdays, I go to Chipotle there.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.560]   And it knows that I go to Chipotle.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.160]   It knows 17 minutes to Bridgewater Commons.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.320]   Yeah, okay, it's time for burrito.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.560]   It knows when to do it.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.720]   It knows when I'm there.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.200]   Of course, Germans would find that freaky.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   I don't.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   I find that amusing.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.840]   I was actually thinking, I think we've talked, I've talked with Mike and Elgin and others
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   about the Android WearWatch.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.880]   And if there's a negative to the Android WearWatch, it doesn't do enough of that.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880]   Enough.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880]   I agree.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.560]   I want more Google now, not less Google now.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.560]   In fact, that would be, I mean, I guess you've got a constrained screen.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.120]   You can't just load it up with stuff.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.440]   But I really like this new Maps feature.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   I love it.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.560]   I mean, it could be like, oh, I see that you, it looks like you pick up coffee most mornings
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.120]   at 9 a.m. at this place.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.800]   Have you tried this other place down the block?
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.600]   You're, you know, your friends, you know, Jason Sarah like this place or something like
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   that.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.600]   Oh, look, we're on it.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   We're, we're, we're here.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.280]   We're a popular attraction in the play and see section.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.280]   Nice.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   What else see?
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280]   Don't play.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   Yay.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.440]   Well, there's not that much stuff within five minutes.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.040]   Yeah, I guess it's, that's, that's probably it.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]   Popular attraction.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.920]   Have you guys played is the new four square out because they did the split off of the check
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   in as a sub.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   Swarm.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   I use swarm, which is the check in part.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   The check in thing.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920]   Is the new core four square out yet?
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   I don't think so.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920]   I have the update.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.920]   Okay.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.520]   So they're going to redo that at the same time.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520]   Right.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.120]   I'd be curious to know that's where four square and Google are going to compete again.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120]   Right.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120]   There's a GATT.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.080]   I mean, I mean, they really, they have Google places.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.080]   So they have all those businesses.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.360]   Seems like they know where you go.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:21.560]   And to me, the, to me, the huge trove of data that's just waiting is they know what restaurants
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.560]   we go to.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560]   Right.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.720]   They know how many people of what type go to what restaurants.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.400]   I mean, American Express knows that too, but no way they can't really use the data.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.880]   Google's been fairly judicious.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.640]   They obviously don't want to go to it.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:38.440]   But Google also knows G, Mr. LaPort stopped for 12 minutes at this address.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.440]   That's a gas station.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.440]   Boom.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.440]   Everybody seems to be going to get that gas station.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.520]   What, what the price is?
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.440]   I mean, you can, there's, there's, there's, there's more data to play with there.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440]   That's phenomenal.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.520]   So you're talking about the passive tracking of your phone's location.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.080]   So Leo's not checking in at that gas station.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080]   Oh, right.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.440]   It just knows where I am.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   Which is what, which is what four square tried.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.120]   And it's probably tried to get to by having people sign up for the app and just do it.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.800]   But it was still, he was still stuck with the, with the check in motif and wants to break
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.960]   out of that.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.960]   You're right.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960]   Um, yeah.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.840]   So explore there and maps.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   You're right.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   Now it's interesting.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840]   I didn't, I hadn't really thought about Google now, but I guess Google now does do that,
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.840]   right?
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.480]   Like when you don't necessarily check in at Chipotle every Saturday, but Google now says,
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   Hey, it's Saturday.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   Are you headed to this, this place?
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.480]   So we're starting to do that.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.480]   Yeah, habit.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480]   Mm hmm.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   Yep.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.280]   Uh, what else do we have?
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280]   Oh, Google voice.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.760]   Uh, Google voice is now offering web based calls through Hangouts.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.520]   No Google plus profile needed.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.520]   So this is, this is a little bit of a minor, minor new feature, but if you use Google
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.040]   voice, it might come in handy.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.440]   Uh, so now this means just Google voice on the web.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.600]   If you go to Google voice on the web, if you search for a user and you click on the call
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:57.560]   button, you can choose which phone to call for that contact and under that, under that
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.120]   choice, Hangouts is now a new option.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.200]   So you can call the person through Hangouts and you don't have to have a Google plus profile
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.560]   set up in order to use that.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.760]   So a little tiny minor move toward integrating voice and Hangouts.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.080]   Uh, I want to see more of that.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.560]   I want to see voice and Hangouts merge completely at some point.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.160]   Gmail for iOS is getting the update that Android's had.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.280]   I believe for a while now, not for a while, but a few weeks, uh, Gmail for, uh, for,
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.880]   for iOS just got insert from drive and save to drive.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.600]   Uh, that update released this past week.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.960]   And just like with Gmail on the web, that means that iOS users can now insert files directly
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.480]   from Google drive into emails and save attachments from emails into Google drive.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.600]   When you, um, if the recipient of the email that you're sending doesn't have access to
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.480]   the Google drive document, you can send them Gmail for iOS will inform you.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.000]   And then you can change the sharing settings, sending, uh, settings before sending it.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.800]   Uh, and that update is, is rolling out now.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.400]   I think it came out this week.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:02.400]   Google Translate has added crowdsourcing features to improve its translations.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.520]   I gotta say, I mean crowdsourcing worked really well in a lot of situations.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.680]   Translations particularly well.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.840]   Um, so Google established the Google translate community, which is open now open to everyone.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.600]   So if that gives users who speak more than one language fluently, the option to offer
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.840]   their own translations and validate current translation.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.920]   So if you are bilingual or multilingual, is you go to translate.google.com/community,
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.440]   you can tell Google what language you, what language did you speak?
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.560]   And then if you click on the get started button, Google will just show you a phrase and say,
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.280]   you know, here's a phrase in English.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.400]   Uh, how would you translate this in another language?
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.040]   And the more people who do this, the better translations will get.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.160]   I think that Google will also show you current translations, current translations that it
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.360]   has and let you, uh, let you correct them or update them.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.720]   Is that an acknowledgement that machine translation just is never going to get as good as human?
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   Exactly.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   Definitely.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.960]   Because given Google's, you know, inclinations, they probably would like the machine to do
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   it all.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.360]   I mean, even with Android apps, when you, when I localize my app and do a few different, a
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.440]   few different languages, it just, there's so many, there's just things that are, you
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   know, there are different translations and you want a human looking at them.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.520]   And even, and even Google, uh, you know, they, they had added the developer console for Android
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.280]   apps that you could basically sign up for a service that had actual humans reviewing
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.560]   your, your translation.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.040]   So they're definitely, they have conceded that machine translations, uh, don't work
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.040]   completely.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.040]   Well, we've all known that.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.720]   But we've known that, right?
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.440]   Anyone, uh, language is just a little too hard.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.000]   It's a lot.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.160]   Finally Chrome beta for Android, which is actually my default browser.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.480]   And it's been, it's been great for me.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   So I recommend it.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.880]   Uh, got the material design makeover or a material design makeover.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.200]   Uh, our technique has a nice rundown of the changes.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:55.880]   You know, it just, the changes are subtle, but also, you know, very, very nice, just kind
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:02.440]   of open, flatter, uh, wider, just much more sort of material design-y than, than you think.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.880]   A little simplicity, fewer lines, uh, more space.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.720]   Uh, the logo got a little bit punching up, a little, a little more colorful.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.240]   Um, a couple of things are broken because it is a beta.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.280]   I think that, I think the number doesn't show up on your tabs button anymore.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.680]   Uh, they've combined the address bar on the search bar in some context.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.960]   In cognito mode, uh, the new tab is completely black and it's got a new icon, just really
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.960]   kind of neat.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.400]   Um, yeah.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.520]   So really nice update there.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.920]   I've been running the Chrome beta.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.760]   Like I said, it's my, it's my default browser and I, I really like it.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.760]   I like it a lot.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.440]   So material design, the material design makeover for Chrome, the Chrome, for Chrome hasn't
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440]   been completed yet.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.800]   I think Google's still, I think it's still a work in progress, but it's kind of neat
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.520]   to see material design rolling out to Chrome and to the play store and to the kind of proprietary
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.640]   Google apps before Android L drops.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.160]   Um, and that's all I got.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.720]   And that's the Google change law.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.800]   I got to bump, bump, boom.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.880]   Boy, it's really depressing when you go to volunteer to help with Google translate and
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.320]   says, select the languages you know.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:14.280]   And you're like, oh, none of those terrible.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.520]   Oh, we're terrible.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.120]   Look at all the languages I could know.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.520]   I had to fake it.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.840]   Say Italian, even though that was totally not true.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   Speak.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.440]   I would say one point one.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   Speak fluently.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.320]   Wouldn't you like to be one of those people, you know, has, but it won't let me check more
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.000]   than five.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.080]   Why limit me?
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.120]   I can speak so many languages.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   It's clean.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   Almost up there.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   Probably.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.120]   Let me see.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.120]   That's a good question.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.120]   Uh, no, they're not looking for Klingon translations.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.120]   Sorry.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.800]   Uh, did they, they also had like, Leet speak and in, but none of those in here.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.320]   This is these are actual languages.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.960]   Cherokee.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.800]   That's interesting.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.800]   Chichua.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   Igbo.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.800]   Talugu.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.800]   Now I'm just saying nonsense words.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.360]   That's a lot of languages.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.360]   There's a lot of languages.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.360]   A lot of languages.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.360]   A lot of languages.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:09.960]   Right to be forgotten.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.280]   Let's give Jeff a chance once again.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.160]   The, the, there's so many, I don't even know what to say.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160]   50% now.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160]   Super, super, super.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.080]   New 20 years Spain.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.160]   What's going on in Spain?
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.760]   Spain has passed a law that requires payment to link.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.760]   What?
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.680]   It's called the Google tax and it's a, it's a prior payment to link and then they're going
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:43.520]   to give them money to big old media companies to say it is just beyond, it even goes beyond
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   the rest of Europe.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.520]   So what is Google going to do?
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:50.440]   I mean, they're not going to pay people to put links and search results.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.440]   Of course not.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.480]   And I think it was, as Boying Boying pointed out that even if you're a small blogger,
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.000]   you can't opt out because it's now considered like a human right in the bill.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.640]   It's a, I don't think it's gone all the way through.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   It's ridiculous.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   It's stupid.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.280]   And now I understand why Google wants me to come over and speak and full disclosure,
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.480]   they pay for my airfare because I'm like, I'll lose money on this, but they don't pay
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.600]   me at a big 10 event at Madrid.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.800]   And now I had a lot of them come to Madrid.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.120]   It's your idiots.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.960]   How do you say idiots Spanish?
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.520]   How do you chat room?
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.000]   We were fluent in five languages.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.600]   We know.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.800]   So there's that, but, but there's, there's a ray of hope this week, the, the lords, the
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.200]   house of lords in the UK has said that right.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.320]   People are going to be on undoable and stupid.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.320]   Good.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.320]   Good.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   The lords now.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   It's the comments.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.960]   Meanwhile, the Google advisory committee is going to hold a bunch of basically public
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.680]   hearings and they've invited people to send them their views.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.960]   It's as if the advisory committee is kind of a faux FCC now.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:59.000]   Oh, I think they should have open hearings.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.160]   They should let you watch the sausage being made.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.600]   And then it would become very obvious very quickly how untenable this is.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.840]   50% of all the requests over a hundred thousand links from 91,000 people have been granted
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   so far.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:17.880]   And there's a list of questions that Google and Bing and Yahoo were called on the carpet.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.440]   Shay Woodshed about their, their implementation because they weren't happy that Google was
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.340]   notifying the D linked that they've been D linked because media stories, media, which
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.740]   is right stories about that.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.540]   So there's this list of questions of what they demanded of them.
[01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:38.420]   And it's just a, a, a, again, it continues the tremendous idiocy of this.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:45.900]   What information do you request from a data subject prior to considering a deleting request?
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.660]   Do you filter out some requests based on the location, nationality or place of residence?
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.660]   Do you delete results?
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:55.980]   It makes it sound like serfs.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:00.580]   What explanation do you provide to data subjects when you refuse to delist?
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:09.900]   Well, we decided not to.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   This is God.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.900]   So hyperlink.
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.940]   I just, this is like, I guess it's a, it's a jobs project for, for the EU, like Google's
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:19.620]   gonna have to hire thousands of people for this.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:24.340]   But in both places is, is a war against the link and the link is the fundamental architecture
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.340]   of the web.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.100]   No, it's a war against the web.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.100]   It is.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:32.900]   The link is subversive and government has finally figured that out and they're trying to subvert
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.060]   the subversion of the link.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:39.060]   And let's hope they fail folks.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.540]   Google has made another big acquisition.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:47.300]   According to sources, venture beat and others reporting, Google has paid $1 billion to buy
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.220]   twitch.tv.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:57.700]   The Justin.tv spinoff that allows you to watch live game streaming.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:01.740]   Sources familiar with the matter told Dean Takahashi a billion.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.740]   One billion dollars.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.860]   And you know what?
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.900]   I don't think anybody's saying it's not worth it.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:14.420]   That's certainly the number one thing to watch on YouTube right now is gameplay, right?
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.020]   PewDiePie and others.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.020]   People love it.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.380]   Watch Michael, he's 11 years old.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:23.300]   That's pretty much all the television he watches is YouTube videos of gameplay.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.980]   That's it.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   It's big money here.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.060]   This is the future.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:33.460]   Both Google and Twitch and declining comment at this point.
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.060]   They bought, they bought YouTube for $1.65 billion.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.060]   So wow.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.060]   Wow.
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.860]   $1 billion.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:47.700]   Which has 50 million monthly, it's not that big, 50 million monthly active users, more
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:53.260]   than a million who broadcast members, members who broadcast videos each month.
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:55.820]   But that's big growth.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:58.980]   They've grown considerably over the last couple of years.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.220]   They also distribute shows from people like CBS, Interactive's GameSpot, Joystick and
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:06.020]   Destructoid, which are gaming news sites.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:10.700]   13 billion minutes of video are watched every month on Twitch.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.140]   I said it with last time we talked about this, I don't get it.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.140]   Well you're old.
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:16.140]   Yeah, I'm old.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.140]   You're old.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.140]   You're not a gamer.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:22.780]   We interviewed on triangulation this week on Monday, the first really successful professional
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.740]   gamer Dennis Fong, his handle was Thresh in '97.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:30.020]   He won the tournament to be the best Quake player in the world.
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:34.460]   Got a John Carmack's red Ferrari as a prize.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:40.740]   And he pointed out that now these tournaments have prize purses in the millions, tens of
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.700]   millions.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.700]   And these tournaments really make their money by broadcasting the gameplay of the tournament
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:49.060]   and then having big events and so forth.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.180]   So what was it, League of Legends tournament?
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.180]   What was the tournament?
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.140]   Yeah League of Legends by Riot.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:59.220]   So it's pretty impressive, I have to say.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:01.980]   It's become big business but it's not for you and me.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.940]   I mean I guess I guess I should celebrate that the entertainment becomes interactive
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.420]   and people are more involved.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   You should watch.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.740]   Some of these are very exciting.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.380]   Some of these videos are very exciting.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.100]   I see, I don't even, I can't play them in the first place.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.740]   I'm not a game player at all.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.420]   Well that's why you don't need a computer.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:22.020]   But you can watch Twitch on your Chrome OS.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.020]   You can.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.020]   You can.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.100]   You do need to have some context right?
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.260]   Like it's only exciting if you have some context.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.420]   Like what's this game about?
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.780]   You want to watch some Twitch video right now?
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:39.780]   Didn't we, was it this show or was it Twitch that we showed the Pokemon Red victory?
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:40.780]   We did on this show.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.780]   That was on this show.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.780]   So you've already seen some.
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.940]   Yeah I mean and it's not really all that much about the game.
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:49.220]   It's about whose personalities of the people who are coming.
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:50.220]   Oh it is okay.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.220]   Yeah absolutely.
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.420]   Like well it's a mix.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:56.700]   I mean Michael watches a lot of these to learn techniques and stuff.
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.260]   Like right now I think what time is it?
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.260]   No he's tough.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.620]   There's a few streamers that I tune into just to watch their screens.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.660]   Because of what they say because they're funny.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.660]   Right.
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.540]   They're great people to hang out.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.540]   And the.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:13.140]   So this is the thousand people are watching this guy playing.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.300]   You're saying I shouldn't do this?
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   Well no the fine.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.980]   It's usually profanity right?
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.980]   Absolutely.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:23.100]   And then also you went into an area that is probably the least appropriate.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.100]   So this is a kid.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.300]   Now look at what he's doing.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.660]   He's on a green screen I would guess.
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:33.260]   And there's him and in the background is his screen.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.860]   So this is a fairly sophisticated setup.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:35.860]   Where should I go?
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:36.860]   Games channels right?
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.100]   No no no games is perfect.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.060]   And then they are rated by most of you.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.740]   So right now League of Legends is on top.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.420]   Yeah it's boring to watch League of Legends.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   Sure absolutely.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:46.420]   So go watch Minecraft.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.420]   Alright Minecraft that's fascinating.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.540]   Right it's number six.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.420]   Who's up there on the top?
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.660]   Up hack has got the John Bams wild.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.900]   D field mark beast machine 911.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.820]   Chaos chunk.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.460]   Kettle.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.660]   Any of those ring a bell?
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.060]   No none of these guys.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.060]   Well he's got look at this.
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.540]   We're also got 1500 viewers.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.740]   Oh this is for mature audiences.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.060]   Yeah so they'll let you know that too.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.740]   I'm surprised people are playing plague.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.060]   There's ink on here.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:23.380]   That's not exactly an action game.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.380]   We're going to start watching that.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.460]   I might warn you there may be fleeting expletives.
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:32.300]   So this game is not exactly, this is a tablet based game.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.660]   Well plague is now a PC game.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.780]   Yeah you can play it on any platform.
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.660]   But it really came out of tablet and it's really a touch game.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.940]   Where you're trying to conquer the world with your plague.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:49.180]   So you design your plague adding capabilities as you go.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.900]   It's not exactly as you can see an action game.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.900]   So you're saying it's disguise.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.900]   That's the thing.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.060]   Yeah it doesn't matter.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.140]   In order for these people like, you know.
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.580]   I feel like I missed a bet.
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:05.300]   There's a guy named Bacon Donut and every night he has 7000 people tuning in to watch
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.300]   his stream.
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:09.140]   Well if I search for Bacon Donut can I watch one of his videos?
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.340]   Yeah he probably has stuff archived.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.340]   Alright.
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.340]   Bacon Bacon Donuts.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.340]   Bacon Bacon Donut.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:15.340]   Or 7us.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:18.020]   You know is another big guy.
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:21.020]   He chad knows all about this because he's under 30.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.500]   He streams 7 days a week you know for 4 hours.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.420]   Does he make money on this?
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.900]   Absolutely.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:30.380]   Bacon Donut is the tastiest.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.860]   How does he make money on this?
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:32.940]   He has a big money.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.860]   Donations are a big ploy.
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.380]   So people don't have money.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:41.780]   Yeah and so what they'll do is they'll have a ticker that shows the latest donations,
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:45.580]   the top donation of the night, the top donation of the week.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.540]   I bet you Michael's watching Bacon Donut.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.540]   So there's Bacon Donut.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.260]   He's doing a, he looks like a Bacon Donut.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:51.780]   So he's doing like a boating animal.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:52.980]   He's on a green screen.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:57.060]   Yeah and some people choose green screen, some people choose face cam box.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.060]   Right.
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.060]   I like the green screen.
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.740]   We really look like you're, although putting your head in the low, I mean well anyway.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:02.740]   So let's hear, let's listen.
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:03.740]   What's going on?
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.740]   You haven't muted.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.740]   So we can't muted?
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.740]   Let's unmute it.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.740]   Let's listen to all the, the Twitch glory.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740]   There we go.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.740]   What's the record?
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.300]   Our record is 2 hours and 30 minutes right now it's about an hour and 8 minutes.
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:16.700]   We're hoping that we can do it a speed and we'll increase it by an hour.
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:19.140]   So he's got somebody narrating because he's obviously busy.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.420]   I was just taking calls.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:23.020]   I was actually in a call with someone that's not Bacon.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.180]   Oh, that's not Bacon Donut.
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:31.140]   One of the things that I find less interesting in this is the, the expression on people's
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:35.740]   faces when they're playing video games is pretty much that of an unconscious zombie.
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.260]   There's no affect.
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:39.260]   There's no smiling.
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:40.260]   There's no laughing.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:42.020]   They don't look like they're having fun.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.020]   That's true.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.020]   That's true.
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:47.740]   Dragon Ball runs the woods completely different.
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:54.540]   So you can see at the top of his video, you know, top this month, top today, most recent.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.540]   There you go.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.540]   He's laughing at him.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.620]   I was about to say that I hope my surgeon has this much concentration, but of course
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.020]   after you die he laughs.
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.140]   I take it back.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:06.820]   Anyway, there you go.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   That's an example.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.700]   And he's making a living doing this.
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.700]   Yes.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.660]   I also like, I just feel a little.
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.420]   Oh, it's five bucks to subscribe.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:19.220]   It's like control of first person watching someone else's game is like, I don't know.
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.060]   It's even more passive than playing.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:25.460]   Yeah, but no, I mean, like the movement of the camera, it's just very.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:26.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.460]   It makes you crazy.
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.460]   It's just orientating.
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.860]   Like, yeah, we're all too old for this.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.860]   Clearly.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.860]   I missed a bet.
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:35.620]   I really think I could have done a good job of this head.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.380]   I've been a little younger.
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:39.420]   I think I'm funnier than a lot of these guys.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:42.620]   I could have done a good narration as I play the game.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:43.620]   I blew it.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.020]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:50.220]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.020]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.500]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.820]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.700]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.700]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:07.220]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:10.220]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:13.220]   I'm going to be a little older than a lot of these guys.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.220]   I guess so.
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.220]   They're definitely off.
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.020]   That doesn't seem like that's a small number, 400 million.
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:22.900]   400 million tasks.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.620]   They sold how many a million Chromecast?
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.420]   400 per device.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:29.420]   Okay.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.420]   Services like YouTube.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:34.900]   Let's see.
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.740]   People are Chromecasting.
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.020]   All they say is they've sold millions and 20 countries.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.020]   They sold millions.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.020]   Sorry.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:43.020]   It was not 1 million.
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.220]   It could be anywhere from 1 to 9.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:47.220]   Right.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.820]   So even if it's 2 million or 3 million.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.940]   It's probably in that ballpark.
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:53.460]   We're talking about 200 casts per device.
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.460]   That's good.
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.900]   That's active use.
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:57.900]   That is active use.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.660]   I would say most people who have a Chromecast use it fairly actively.
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:05.060]   When I finally got a smart TV and where I watched TV most of the time, I don't use
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.060]   my Chromecast.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.060]   You stopped using it.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.620]   Pretty much because I'm even in that flexor whatever.
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:12.340]   Do we care that the judges of the Fyse-Cort?
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.540]   The Fyse-Cort is rotated in and out.
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.260]   The judges come from pool.
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:21.020]   But some of these judges own Verizon stock.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.020]   Do we care about that?
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:25.220]   Is that a big story?
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.980]   It's fun to be able to find any fault we can with this whole system.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:34.980]   But the truth is it's not like Verizon makes money hand over fist from Fyse-Cort.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:38.980]   Fyse-Cort judge Susan Wright purchased Verizon stock valued at, unfortunately, we don't
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:43.220]   know the amount, $15,000 or less on October 22nd.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:47.900]   Dennis Saler owned Verizon stock, got a dividend of less than $1,000.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:52.500]   Government disclosures don't include hard amounts.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.980]   You've said many times you own what I don't know, a handful of shares of Google.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.380]   I don't think that.
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:59.380]   I don't know.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:06.460]   Normally a judge will recuse himself or herself if it's ruling on a case that he has a financial
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.940]   interest in.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:14.180]   So if he owns stock, he should recuse himself on a case that involves rising, I guess.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.180]   I don't know.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:17.340]   I promise all of this is so secret.
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.420]   You just don't know what's going on.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.860]   Are we going to see a Nexus 6, a Nexus Fablet?
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:28.300]   Sources say Google and Motorola are working on something, Android police.
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:32.100]   Of course, just as soon as I buy the OnePlus One, of course, is a new phone.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:37.180]   5.9 inches is a little bit bigger.
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:44.300]   The information Jessica Lesson's story corroborates the earlier report, provides additional detail.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:49.940]   I wonder whether doing a Nexus phone Motorola was a condition of sale to Lenovo.
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:50.940]   Oh, interesting.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.940]   It's just speculation.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.420]   It might be.
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:55.420]   Who would make that condition?
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.780]   Google or Lenovo?
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.780]   I think it's good for Lenovo.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.780]   It's good for Lenovo.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.700]   It gives them something to sell.
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:05.060]   The codename is Shamu, as you know, a killer whale.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:07.060]   So it would make sense.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.300]   It would be a large device.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:13.300]   I'm waiting for the new Motorola, whatever they're going to call it, that they registered
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:17.300]   a trademark for Motorola Max.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.300]   They already have the Droid Max.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.700]   Oh, the Moto Max?
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:26.860]   The X successor or the Moto X plus one?
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.860]   That's what I'm wondering.
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.900]   That's the one I'm very interested in.
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.460]   We haven't heard a thing.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:37.740]   Google has trademarked Moto, M-O-T-O-M-A-X-X.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.900]   They already have Max for the Droid.
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.700]   I guess they don't have a Moto.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.660]   All right.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:49.260]   We have now gone through every story that seems of-
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.660]   Yeah, we made a show out of it.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.660]   There wasn't much news.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:54.860]   Should we talk real quick about the Twitter hashtag?
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:25:00.420]   Well, Twitter's announcement and then they ask Costolo to hashtag getting taken over a
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.420]   little bit yesterday.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.420]   Sure.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:03.420]   So Twitter-
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.420]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.740]   Stock went up 30%.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:12.780]   They beat their street on their Q2 user growth revenue and they even turned to profits.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:16.980]   Congratulations, Twitter in their most recent quarter.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:18.980]   And so what Evan did a Q&A?
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:24.380]   Yeah, Dick Costolo does a Q&A on CNBC.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:31.260]   And CNBC says, "Okay, hashtag your questions for the CEO of Twitter with ask Costolo," which
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:34.540]   is his instead of ask Dick, ask Costolo.
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:35.820]   Probably better, yeah.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:43.180]   A tremendous number of users, particularly in sort of my community and the folks who
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:48.220]   rail against harassment and abuse on social networks, particularly around gender and race
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:52.740]   and ableism and all that stuff, really kind of took over the hashtag demanding to know
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:57.740]   like, what is Twitter going to do about abuse and harassment?
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:00.580]   Because look, the truth is, it's a lot easier.
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:03.620]   It's a lot, it's very easy to report spam on Twitter and spammers get dealt with pretty
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.620]   quickly.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.020]   But when you're being called names, when you're being threatened and abused or whatever,
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:15.380]   often there's no response or very small response or response that's two months later.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.380]   So it was interesting.
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:18.260]   It was very interesting to watch the whole thing go down.
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.580]   I was a lot of bunch of people who I follow were participating in the hashtag and then
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.900]   retweeting questions that people were posting.
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.100]   And I actually participated in hashtag.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.100]   I don't do that very often.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.100]   What did you say?
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.100]   What did you ask?
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:34.100]   I just said that I hope that he was listening to those questions.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:38.100]   The new CNBC wasn't going to pose those questions to him, right?
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.940]   So people ask, does Twitter call violent accounts?
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.460]   Does Twitter, how many times does you have to report an account that exists solely for
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.460]   smearing people?
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.860]   We, by the way, I get abused mercilessly on Twitter.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.380]   I just block the account so I don't ever see it.
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.900]   Which seems to me fine.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.420]   My Twitter stream for a long time, I just didn't want to even look at it because it's
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.580]   so negative.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.900]   So I just realized, well, I can just block those people and I just block them and I don't
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:02.900]   see them.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.820]   But you know, someone like Adriah Richards, for example, when that whole thing went down,
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:11.660]   she was actively threatened and abused.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.940]   I mean, there was a huge spike in activity for that kind of thing.
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:17.340]   And you really, you do feel helpless.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.780]   And when I defended her, I got crazy.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:23.140]   And I get a sort of low level of harassment.
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:24.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.140]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:31.260]   Just because you don't see it and it's going on about you, that's not a lot of fun to just
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.260]   have this unimagined.
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:33.900]   Well, I don't know.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:38.140]   I'm completely in the dark about it unless somebody comes to me and says it's going on.
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.140]   I don't see it.
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.140]   Maybe you guys see it.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:41.140]   You probably do see it.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:42.140]   But I don't know.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:43.940]   It doesn't bother me.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:50.340]   And frankly, it seems like I'm sure, well, I don't, you know, of course, and there's a
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:58.180]   good article, a blog post about the least Twitter could do, Danalow Campos writing, about some
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:27:59.900]   of the things that Twitter could do.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.220]   For instance, block users who account.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.660]   You should have a block all users.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:09.300]   Allow users to block all users who accounts are less than 30 days old.
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:12.500]   Because the problem with this, and I can understand Twitter's position, it's the same thing as
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:16.620]   saying to Yahoo, hey, you got to stop spam.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:20.380]   Good luck is it's easy to create a Twitter account.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:24.580]   People do it all the time and they do it particularly to harass.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.740]   So I guess giving us better tools.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:27.740]   Right.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.100]   And they just create new ones.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:34.180]   So Danalow is saying give us tools to block users who are accounts or brand new block users
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.780]   whose follow counts are less than a threshold.
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.140]   A lot of the accounts attack me have, you know, 10 followers.
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:46.020]   They were created last month block new users whose @ replies include any words the user
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.020]   decides.
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:51.620]   So you could say, hey, if they say, you know, screw Leo, report, well, I don't want to see
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.620]   that.
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:58.300]   Block any user has been blocked by more than a certain number of people I'm following.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:02.220]   You know, I just, it's, it works pretty well for me just to go into my feed.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.020]   And whenever somebody says something, I find trollish, I just block them and I never see
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.820]   them again.
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:11.020]   And it's really made my Twitter feed a lot more pleasant.
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.020]   Right.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:13.020]   Right.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:16.780]   But if you have a concentrated attack, you know, if the, I don't know, you know, if some
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:21.020]   Reddit board decides to attack a particular user, you know, I think I could Twitter do.
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.020]   I mean, how could Twitter?
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:26.820]   I mean, I think, I think that some of these suggestions that he made are pretty good.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:31.720]   Um, I think it's, you know, this gets into free speech, issues are free speech and what
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:32.820]   could they possibly do?
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.900]   And is it Twitter's job to police what people can say on their service?
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.660]   But it does sort of get down to that, you know, if, if, and this was the same question,
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:45.660]   what happened with Reddit with the troll who was posting, you know, whatever, posting
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:49.380]   photos of, of young women and bikinis or whatever.
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:52.060]   Um, I forget violent acres, the violent acres story.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:55.460]   And it kind of came down to this thing was like, we're a platform and does the, you know,
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:30:00.100]   the telephone company moderate what people say on the phone and, and this whole question.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:03.980]   And I mean, I sort of land on the side of, you know, Twitter has built spam filters,
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:04.980]   right?
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:09.900]   Um, like, like these, and so has Reddit, like these platforms for communication have built
[01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:14.980]   algorithmic ways to deal with spam in order to improve the user experience.
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:20.500]   And I think dealing, you know, creating algorithms or offering users more control, like some
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:26.580]   of these controls that that, that deal, um, uh, proposed is, is a way that they can also
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:30.740]   improve the user experience, but they typically don't because these are usually folks that
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.460]   get threatened and harassed on Twitter are, are disempowered groups of folks and people,
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.140]   you know, the people of color, they're women.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:42.220]   They're not, they're not, you know, um, privileged folks with lots of free time and lots of money
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:46.220]   and lots of power don't feel threatened by someone photoshopping an image of them.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:50.380]   Uh, you know, so anyway, I thought, I thought it was interesting.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:55.020]   You know, it goes, it goes to the right to be forgotten question too.
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:56.260]   Because it does, it does.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:31:01.260]   It does the law of certain things and, and I'm objecting greatly to the right to be forgotten.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:04.860]   Um, people, some people say to me, well, whole, whole long drivers, you know, they kill certain
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:05.860]   stuff.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:10.860]   And if you go back to Brandeis and Warren and their, their groundbreaking essay on privacy
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:16.460]   in the US, um, it came down to a right to be let alone.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.180]   And that was their definition of privacy in the end.
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.340]   And so it's part of what you're saying really is in a sense that if you're, if you're not
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:24.980]   well known, if you're not trying to be out there, if you're not trying anything, and
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.700]   people are just coming after you, do you have a right to be let alone?
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:36.140]   And it sounds right that we should, but then again, you know, you have to get pretty far
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:41.580]   down the road on harassment in real life to, to get a, an injunction slapped against you.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:46.220]   Gina, would it be, would it be sufficient for you if, if, uh, Twitter provided some
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.380]   of these tools that Danola's suggesting?
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.500]   I mean, I think that these are, these are some ways to give users control.
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:57.100]   I mean, I've certainly been a situations where my mentions column not only made me feel,
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:01.900]   you know, sort of upset as being called names and whatever, but made me feel like helpless
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:04.740]   because I, I felt like I can block this person.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:08.660]   They can continue to say things about me that I will no longer see, but we'll still be out
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.660]   there.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:12.780]   Like, is it my job to sort of monitor whether or not these book people are going to show
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:17.940]   up at my house or, or, you know, what, um, you know, but it, and it's that feeling of
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:18.940]   helplessness.
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:24.460]   But the platform is, is built well, you, you want to give users a feeling of, of control.
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:28.460]   So yeah, I think that some of these, these controls are, are good suggestions.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.540]   The best control, they could do is make it so you don't see it.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:35.460]   It doesn't, that does not respond to your issue of, should I pay attention to what they're
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:39.660]   saying in case they're actually act, going to commit an act of violence.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.780]   You have to read those to do that.
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:46.300]   So, um, I think the, I mean, I don't, in that case, what do you do?
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.180]   Does Twitter have to, um,
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:52.020]   I'd want faster responses from Twitter to say, they should ban, if it's abusive speech,
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.020]   they should ban that person.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:55.020]   And I mean, and they have to make those decisions every day.
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.260]   Because they create a new account.
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.580]   I mean, it takes no time.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:58.580]   Right.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.580]   That's right.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.580]   That's right.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.220]   But it feels like there are ways that, you know, program both programmatically and with
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:07.820]   a little human intervention that you could, you could detect those, those kinds of things.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:08.820]   Lock somebody's IP address.
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:09.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:12.340]   I mean, you could detect if it's coming from the same IP address.
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.220]   You could detect to see, you know, we do that in the chat room.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.860]   We actually do do that in the chat room.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860]   We enforce those rules.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:22.380]   Well, you know, Leo, I think part of the issue though, is that, you know, somebody,
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:24.660]   I'm not going to, I'm not going to give this person a moment's attention.
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:27.700]   So I'm, please allow me to be very generic.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.420]   Someone wrote a really nasty piece about me some time ago.
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:34.100]   Um, well, somebody wrote really nasty when you know about it a long time ago, but, but,
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.700]   but a little more recently.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:38.340]   And I could tell what it was going to be a paragraph in.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:40.740]   And I just, well, I, I, I read it.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:41.740]   Right.
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.380]   And I, yeah, I saw a couple of people tweet about it at the time.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:45.940]   And I just, you know, ignored it.
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:49.700]   And I'm not going to give the person the slightest satisfaction that they, I didn't,
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:50.940]   what else can you do?
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.940]   What else can you, I didn't see it.
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:57.620]   And so to some level, uh, you know, and I've had, I haven't had anything that women have,
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:00.420]   but I've had a few, not jobs come after me.
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:04.820]   And at some point, if they get absolutely no satisfaction from no, if they know that
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:10.860]   you are not seeing what they're saying, um, it takes away some of, well, I'll give you
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:18.500]   an example of some of the people who are tweeting against me are tweeting that to sponsors.
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:19.940]   Now what do we do?
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.940]   Right.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.940]   Right.
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.380]   And the concerns, the sponsors, the sponsors don't understand.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.500]   I mean, we tell the sponsor, they just trolls.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.500]   Don't worry about it.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:28.980]   The trolls and celebrity.
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980]   That concerns them.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.980]   So that's an economic.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:37.860]   I mean, I, I mean, the violence is a whole different thing and much, much worse obviously.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.900]   Um, so, but I don't know what you do.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:46.220]   But there's also like, I think the three of us have been public figures to some extent,
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.500]   you know, for a long time.
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:50.980]   I mean, life hacker, my first two months at life hacker, I mean, I was like getting
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:54.900]   thrown in the boiling water of being just exposed to so many people.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.980]   I mean, I was shell shocked.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:02.100]   I had just never had such a big audience and I had never been criticized so and nitpicked
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:04.580]   and just discussed so publicly before.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.060]   And it's, it's very jarring.
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:11.740]   If you've never had that situation before and now I feel like I have a much thicker skin,
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:17.340]   I'm much, I can much more, much more likely to just brush off somebody who, you know,
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:20.380]   but in the beginning and for someone who's not used to it.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.420]   And I think that this is happening to people who, you know, don't, you know, have a couple
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.900]   hundred followers and it's the first time they've really had any sort of public, public
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.060]   persona or, you know, they're gaining some sort of following for whatever reason.
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:35.500]   I think it's, it's genuinely frightening and I don't think the solution is, hey, just
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:38.700]   don't pay attention to worry about it, you know, because I think in the moment you feel
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.100]   really alone and you think, what have I shared online?
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:44.340]   What can somebody find out about me if they, you know, if they're really dedicated to making
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:48.340]   my life miserable and you start to reevaluate and feel unsafe and disempowered and helpless
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:50.180]   and, you know, it spirals.
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:53.300]   I think it's, I think it's a hard experience for, for noobs.
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:55.580]   And I think for us, it's easy to say.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:56.580]   All right.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:58.660]   This is just another all crazy.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:02.700]   It's all true, but I don't think the solution is an algorithm that's going to cut it out
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.300]   because you're right to be forgotten, right to be let alone.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.860]   You're going to wait for the next law to come out of Europe to say that people have the
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:11.460]   right to kill people who are being abusive, kill comments by people who are being abusive
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.380]   to them and we're back into the same discussion about freedom of speech.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:18.140]   There is at least one of one of my trolls is mentally ill.
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:20.780]   I mean, I'm not diagnosable.
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:23.500]   So and perhaps could be dangerous.
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:24.500]   Who knows?
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.500]   Yes.
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:31.300]   But what, what, so the process exists and I've done this before where you get us, you go
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:38.020]   to the Twitter, you actually go to your police and if they, if they think that that's reasonable
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:42.100]   that you should be in fear of, you know, for your personal safety, they get a subpoena,
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:45.660]   they go to Twitter, Twitter won't give you this without a subpoena, but Twitter will give
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:46.660]   it to you with a subpoena.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:49.980]   They give you the IP address of the person, then you have to get another subpoena, go to
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.700]   that person's internet service provider.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:56.940]   We have done this and track that person down and then the local police in that jurisdiction
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:59.220]   go to that person's house.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:00.220]   That's all you can do.
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:02.540]   Twitter's supposed to do in that.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:06.540]   Would you want a Twitter that just says whenever I ask, oh, yeah, I'll give you that person's
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:07.540]   IP address.
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:08.540]   No, they should.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:09.540]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:10.540]   You can do.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.540]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:15.540]   Well, just, just, just, there's a range here, right?
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:18.380]   Take for a moment the person needs their meds out of this because.
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.580]   Yeah, these nothing can fix them.
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:22.940]   You know, you know, believe me, I am sympathetic to my illness.
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:25.100]   We mean, that's not a...
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:26.100]   Yes.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.820]   It's literally, they need their meds.
[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:32.460]   They're in trouble and I feel for them.
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:36.100]   But for the people who just troll for the sake of trolling, the sake of getting that
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:42.860]   you, what we need is for societies norms to mean that people pile up in defense of you
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.700]   and deal with it and reject it.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:46.700]   Is that the right thing to do?
[01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:49.100]   There's a horrible show on ABC, I think it is.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.220]   What would you do, show?
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.220]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:58.020]   You know, they'll have a guy, a sleazy guy picking up on some girl who's alone in a
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.460]   cafe and they wait for some, I hate the show.
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:03.060]   I hate the show because it prides to make people look bad.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.060]   Right.
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:08.180]   But some, some brave grandma will go and defend him and say, "Get away from her and come
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:09.180]   of your honey."
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.620]   And then it shows that there's still decent people on earth.
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.620]   But there are.
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:18.660]   And, and, and, and why won't a sleazy guy go in and the cafe and just, you know, hit
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:23.060]   on any 15 year old girl because there are norms and somebody will stand up and somebody
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:24.180]   will do something to some point.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:27.740]   And we have to be in a society with to figure out ways where that happens.
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:31.820]   The problem is, yeah, it's, it's true in a cafe that that works.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:32.820]   It doesn't work on Twitter.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:35.180]   It's like it's the opposite of Twitter.
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:36.180]   It encourages them.
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:38.980]   Twitter can offer tools that would make that happen.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:43.140]   Phil, for example, Leo, if I see somebody abusing you and calling you, you know, making
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.420]   threats toward you, I can't report that person for abusing you.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:47.980]   You have to report that person, right?
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:49.660]   And that doesn't really make sense.
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:51.860]   Why shouldn't we all be able to look out for one another?
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:57.100]   Why shouldn't I be able to say, see, "Oh, 10 of my friends have blocked this guy?"
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.700]   Because that, you know, that, that would make me feel less alone.
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:03.100]   I mean, I just, it just feels like, you know, when I was a little kid, I was getting bullied,
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:06.300]   my sister marched around the corner and told, told the girl she'd punch her in the face.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.740]   Like this is, you know, this is how it works sort of in life.
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:13.340]   And I feel like Twitter could provide more tools to help people feel, to help users feel
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:14.340]   more empowered.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:17.940]   I felt like the point of the hashtag yesterday is that a lot of users, Twitter users.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.900]   And the majority of Twitter users are people of color.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:24.820]   And at least I would guess about half or women, right?
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:29.580]   Just feel disempowered and feel helpless and feel like their reports don't get any sort
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:34.700]   of response and don't feel like they have the tools that they need to deal with them.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.380]   It's my guess that Dick is pretty sympathetic to this.
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:41.780]   And I would expect him to the degree that he can that he would respond to this, right?
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:42.780]   Or do you?
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:43.780]   He is.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:46.540]   He said that he was in a meeting with his abuse team today after this whole thing happened
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:47.540]   yesterday.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:48.540]   Like he's a good guy.
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.780]   I don't feel like he's evil in any way.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.780]   No, no, no.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.780]   Yeah, I know.
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.780]   I don't either.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.780]   I don't either.
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:57.780]   It's interesting though that this, that the earnings report was what spurred this, uh,
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:58.780]   the hashtag take over.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.780]   I found it.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.780]   I found it really interesting.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:06.020]   Well, in a way, he was a victim of Twitter's malleability, right?
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:09.340]   Yeah, I guess the like is the dick bar was pretty bad as well, right?
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:13.380]   That was that was also the hashtag movement right against the Twitter.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:17.380]   You got to think Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, gets more of this than anybody.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.380]   Right?
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:19.380]   I don't know.
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.380]   You think he gets a lot of abuse?
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:23.020]   He can afford security.
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:24.740]   He can afford security.
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:25.740]   All right.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:30.220]   We're, it's, you know, we, this is the only show that we talk about this stuff on it.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:31.780]   It's a good conversation.
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:32.780]   Thank you for letting me in.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:34.780]   No, I'm very important.
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:36.420]   It's really good points.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.020]   As always with the show, we talk about the big, bigger philosophical issues, the bigger
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:45.120]   issues that, you know, we are faced with in this new world of ours, but now would be
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:51.760]   a good time to get to the back of the book, the tip, the number and the tool of the week.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.120]   So let's start with your tip, Gina.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:58.760]   So you can now ask a Google now for directions to my hotel.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.280]   Oh, I like that.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.620]   So if you got hotel reservations stored in your Gmail account, Google know, Google now
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:05.620]   knows about it.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:10.140]   And you can say, show me restaurants near my hotel or get me directions to my hotel from
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.140]   here.
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.600]   And Google now will automatically map the phrase, my hotel to the hotel where you're
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.060]   staying pretty neat.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:21.040]   So it's kind of an extension of, you know, get me directions to work or to get me directions
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.040]   to home.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.480]   And it's just now a temporary, you know, a location if you're staying in a hotel, pretty
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.480]   smart.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480]   My hotel.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   My hotel.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:34.880]   Does it have, you have to have a confirmation from that hotel in your email or something like
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.880]   that?
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.880]   Yep.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.360]   That's how it knows.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.880]   Mm hmm.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.880]   Cool.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.080]   Jeff, you have as usual many numbers pick as many as you have.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:46.680]   Yeah, I'll go over this one.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:47.680]   Okay.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.520]   So after the stock went up this week on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, you might have seen is now
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:54.320]   worth more than the Google founders.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.320]   Wow.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.560]   Not that that's terribly being full ball attack.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:03.800]   So it's $33.3 billion, ranking him at number 16.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:06.640]   The Google founders are 17 and 18 Bezos.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.640]   Wow.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:11.280]   Bill Gates used to be the richest man with a mere $32 billion.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.240]   So wait, who's number one then?
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.040]   I'm afraid you're going to ask me that.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.040]   Oh, sorry.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.960]   This is the, I don't deal in number six or seven, Jeff.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.320]   I want to know who's number one.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.320]   Who's number one?
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.320]   Oh, this is okay.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.320]   This is just the tech guy.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.720]   Probably Warren Buffett or something.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   Yeah, probably.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.720]   All right.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:34.160]   No, Bill Gates is still the richest man in the world.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.560]   84.7 billion dollars.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.560]   Wow.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.160]   Give him, give him it away.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.480]   His net worth has grown 8% this year, but it's not just Microsoft.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:51.600]   He also has significant investments in the Canadian natural railway company and Republic
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:52.600]   services.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:54.440]   I don't know what they do.
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:58.600]   $400 million in dividends alone this year.
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:05.240]   Number two, Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecommunications tycoon with the best name in the world.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.240]   Carlos Slim.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.560]   New York Times stock.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.040]   He sounds like Carlos Slim sounds like he's a poker player.
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.160]   He has 78.8 billion dollars.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:16.120]   So Bill Gates, still the richest man in the world.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.680]   So he see inflation.
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:19.440]   That's all that is.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:20.440]   Wow.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.960]   Just give me one billion, just one billion.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.960]   Just one.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.960]   That's all I can.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:25.960]   I can just ask you.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:26.960]   You're greedy.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.600]   I'll do the hundred million.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.240]   I'll go hundred million.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:32.240]   I'm not.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.240]   All right.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.240]   All right.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.240]   All right.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:36.240]   That's a hundred million.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.240]   All right.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.600]   It's only 300 million.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600]   That's just 300 million.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600]   That's nothing.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   That's nothing.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.160]   Now we got to convince somebody to give it to the Senate.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.280]   And my tool is, I think it's pretty obvious.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:55.000]   So it's a great story because you cannot get the one plus one phone, at least not at its
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:02.120]   face value, which is a remarkable $300 for the 16 gig, $350 for the 64 gig top of the
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.120]   line.
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:04.200]   They call it a flagship killer.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:09.640]   And it is with a Qualcomm 801 quad core snapdragon with a great camera.
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.880]   You saw probably Jason's review on before you buy her yesterday on all about Android.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.080]   He's been using this phone.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.320]   So, but we've been trying to like the Dickens because you have to either play a contest.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.360]   I mean, I entered all the contests I could and I wasn't going to destroy my phone on video,
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.120]   but I did everything else and asked for invitations.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.960]   And we never got finally one of our viewers very kindly.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.960]   Did you get the same person I did?
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.960]   I don't know.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.960]   No, I think they were different.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:38.840]   Offering a phone.
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.440]   And so we said, yes.
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.320]   And Jason bought it, reviewed it.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.320]   Well, I bought it.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.400]   Jason reviewed it.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.040]   And Jason very kindly has let me take it from him.
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:51.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.800]   Poor Jason gets Google Glass and you get the one plus.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.200]   Not fair.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.200]   Hey.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:01.760]   Well, maybe I'll give it back when the Moto X plus one comes out or whatever.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.280]   But I want to give a shout out to Ryan's Zucchini who tweeted.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.320]   Is that how you got one?
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.560]   Is that how you got it?
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.760]   And then he offered Gina one too, but Gina had already gotten the kind viewer.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.600]   So, thank you to all three of our benefactors.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.200]   But what the hell is going on with OnePlus?
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:23.000]   Why are they making it so hard to get this phone?
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.520]   I mean, if it's a marketing stop, it's working.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.560]   Yeah, but at this point you want to pull the, you want to say, okay, now we've got a million
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.560]   of them.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.560]   Right.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:32.760]   Maybe they don't.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:36.840]   Well, there's some, I think I'm calling shenanigans.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:38.600]   Yeah, I think it's mine.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.160]   First of all, they said in their shipping email that like their startup and they're
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.480]   still refining their processes and to be patient.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.560]   Like, and it took them a couple of days, like several days to process my order, just
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.720]   to process the order.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:52.720]   So I don't know.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:53.720]   I don't know.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.320]   Maybe there's what I think.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.840]   I think they're selling it below cost.
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.560]   I think there's no way this costs 350 bucks.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.560]   Yes.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.240]   It is definitely marketing, but it is not marketing for OnePlus.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:11.600]   OnePlus was founded by two people who I think may even still work for a company called Oppo.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.600]   Oppo.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:19.000]   One plus one O P O and Oppo makes a phone that is virtually identical.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.960]   It is.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.120]   It's virtually identical called the fine seven.
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:25.960]   And it costs a little bit more.
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.760]   It costs what it should cost around 700 bucks, right?
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.360]   This is currently not available yet either in the United States.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.560]   Oh, and the websites look so similar, by the way.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.280]   So here's what I think.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:43.200]   I think this is actually the effect in some ways to find is even better.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:45.480]   It's got a higher res display, et cetera.
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.960]   This is a, they're selling their loss.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.280]   So they don't want to sell too many.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.920]   It is a marketing ploy, but not for this phone.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:57.360]   It's a marketing ploy for Oppo and the fine.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.360]   That's my interesting.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   Whoops.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360]   Interesting.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.360]   Oh, you turned on the light.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.360]   Jason complained about that.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.280]   It's too easy to do because it does these gestures.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:11.800]   If V turns on the light because I can't figure otherwise I can't figure this out.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.640]   I'm convinced now that you bought one of you.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.440]   You get the website is basically exactly the same.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.400]   I think you might, I think you might be right there.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:21.240]   I think Oppo very cleverly said, okay, we're going to create this dummy company.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.800]   We fund it.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.040]   Build this phone that is essentially the same as the fine to find 7A.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.840]   We're going to ship cyanogen and we're going to do invites and we're going to get the most
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.800]   influential and dedicated Android power users.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.120]   And by the way, the find also runs cyanogen.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.920]   Oh, the fine does run cyanogen.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.640]   And I think what they've done is that they're selling this.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.680]   We got this at half the actual cost.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:50.160]   Although I saw a, was it I supply one of the companies said they cost, should cost them
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.360]   around $200 to build.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.320]   So maybe they are making some money on it.
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:54.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:57.520]   Is the find unlocked in the whole deal?
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:59.880]   I mean, maybe they're play edition.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.360]   This is their nexus.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.280]   This is the developer enthusiast phone.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.520]   I think Oppo, well, that and that's the other thing is you can't, yet you can get the older
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.520]   find.
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:10.000]   You can't get the new one that's really close to this.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.160]   You can get the N1, the fine five, but this new fine seven is just about to come out.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:19.640]   I think this is all marketing play for the fine seven.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:20.640]   And that they're selling it.
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:23.400]   The reason they don't want a lot of people to buy it is because it costs them.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.160]   That's my guess.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.080]   Otherwise, why do it?
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.440]   I mean, you at some point you got to pull the plug, you know, you got to end the marketing
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.760]   and give and make millions.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.800]   I don't know.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:43.760]   The one plus one is slightly larger, a millimeter wider.
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.760]   It's thinner and lighter than the find, but I think functionally it's pretty similar.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:49.760]   I don't know.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.760]   I can't figure it out.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.760]   You tell me.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:56.280]   But if you can get an invite now, there are companies selling these at a premium.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.440]   Expansis US has it for $500, $200 markup.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:08.160]   And if the CIFINE 7A in Germany, they'd quote it in US dollars, it's 500 bucks.
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:12.320]   I don't know.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.280]   I'm just curious.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.280]   I just don't understand it.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.560]   Anyway, but it is my tool of the week.
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.320]   I am really impressed with this phone and it feels good.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.680]   It's five and a half inch screen.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:27.200]   The other one that you probably would want to look at is the G3 if you want to get a big
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.200]   screen phone.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.160]   But I'll be curious.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.800]   So you both getting one plus is.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.000]   I was going to say, I mean, with the exception of one of the Nexus is this might be the first
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.480]   time that the three hosts of Twig have settled on the same phone as our daily everyday phone.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.200]   That's saying something.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.200]   We hook line and sinker, man.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:47.360]   It's like I got to change the sim that just.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.680]   I also want to be able to go back and forth.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.960]   It is not a nano salmon is a micro.
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.880]   Every time I change the sim, something goes wrong with my unlimited data account.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.920]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.400]   You're going to have a Comcast day too.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.720]   Well, apparently there's an adapter.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.560]   You can snap a nano sim into a micro sim adapter.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.040]   Well, and when you because when I use my sim cutter, I save the frame.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.920]   So if I can only find that, but yeah, it's just a little bit that goes around it.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:11.920]   I have a lot of it.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.120]   Maybe you want to try that.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.280]   Yeah, it just it pops into it and then it's a full size.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.280]   Every go.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.440]   Every time I go to T mobile, they're like, how did you get this plan?
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:22.200]   And I'm just like, don't change anything.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.880]   Just give me a new sim.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   Just don't change anything.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:32.880]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes a very fine this week in Google.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.880]   I was nice.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.240]   We had just a little time to sit back, relax, talk philosophy.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:38.240]   And I like that.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.040]   I appreciate that.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.760]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.520]   Nina Trappani, you'll find her at life.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.280]   No, not life hacker.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.280]   Smarterware.org, but mostly at ThinkUp.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.280]   ThinkUp.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.280]   Yeah, I got a phone.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.120]   In fact, if I go to Leo, I haven't looked at my insights this week.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.080]   Leo, the port.thinkup.com.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:58.520]   We launched a free trial, actually.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:02.720]   I think since the last time we talked, you can try it and think up out now for free.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:05.320]   Just go to thinkup.com, use it with your Twitter or Facebook.

[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.360]   Here's the top level.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.200]   What's happening with my tweets?
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.600]   Whatever Leo LaPort said in the past week must have been memorable.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.520]   There were 77 favorites.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:20.040]   63 replies, 23 week tweets.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.560]   Nice chart.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:22.560]   Three interest.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:23.560]   Yeah, that's a good chart.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.760]   I like that.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:29.040]   Three interesting people followed me more than that.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.040]   Oh, but I did.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:34.040]   I only had 10 tweets, which is for fewer than the week before.
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:36.040]   Here's what I favored it in the years past.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:38.120]   It's great stuff.
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:40.240]   30% of my tweets.
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.240]   I like this.
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:44.080]   Self-reflection is powerful stuff.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:45.640]   She's definitely changed that one.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.760]   30% of my tweets contain the words, "I mean mine or myself."
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.000]   That's an awful lot.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.960]   It's not all of them.
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:55.920]   My best response between 5 and 6 p.m.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:56.920]   See, that's good to know.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.920]   You want to keep track about that.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.600]   So, this is good.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.320]   My most popular tweet a year ago.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.080]   Gosh, that was a year ago.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:06.480]   I know, right?
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.480]   I say that every day when I see that inside of my mouth.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:09.760]   Here we go, really.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.760]   High fives.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.240]   This is fun.
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:17.720]   So, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much, Gina Trepani for being here.
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:18.720]   We wouldn't do without you.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:22.720]   And don't forget to watch her on all about Android, which is every Tuesday evening on
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:23.720]   this now.
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:24.720]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:25.720]   5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.080]   Jeff Jarvis is going to relax today.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.360]   He's not going to attempt anything too complicated.
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:34.040]   Whatever you do, stay off ladders.
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.560]   Do not try to fix the well.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.040]   Well, we did that last week.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.320]   I told you that was that last week.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.200]   No, you had well problems last week.
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.200]   Yeah, we did.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:48.120]   At the same time, we had to put in a new septic because the septic broke.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:51.560]   I was just going to say, if the well's gone, the septic must be next.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.600]   Yeah, it was both of them.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.600]   Country living.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:55.600]   Country living.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:56.600]   Wow.
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.840]   $28,000 for a place to put my...
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:52:59.840]   Mm.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:00.840]   Yeah, septic.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.840]   So, you had to dig a new one?
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.840]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.840]   $28,000.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.840]   Oh, yeah, it's expensive.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.840]   $28,000.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.840]   Well, I'm living in the city.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:09.840]   Well, he has...
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:10.840]   You have to dig it.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:11.840]   Yeah, I didn't dig it.
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:12.840]   Did you have it?
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:13.840]   I can't go out there with a shovel.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.840]   All of the technology now is unbelievable.
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.840]   Oh, it's not just a little backhoe.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.920]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, God.
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:20.920]   No, God knows.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.920]   Big hole there.
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.920]   So, there's two sisters.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.480]   You have a switch back and forth, right?
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.480]   Every six months.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:28.080]   Oh, I didn't know that part.
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:29.080]   Okay.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.080]   So, it goes into the thing.
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:34.320]   And the leach field is half a football field.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.320]   Dug down four feet of stone and sand.
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:38.320]   That's right.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:39.320]   Yep.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:41.520]   Then these big black thick tubes across that.
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:45.320]   And then the white tubes into that.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.840]   And then more sand on top of that.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:52.320]   And then, of course, white pipes sticking up all over my yard now.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320]   Oh.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.720]   So, at the same time...
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:57.120]   We're both on septic systems.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.720]   We'll have a little conversation.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:53:59.720]   Yes.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.720]   And I want to...
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.240]   Off the air, we can pair a whole...
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:04.040]   How old was your system?
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.040]   45 years.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.040]   Well, that's...
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.040]   You got a good use out of it.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.040]   28 grand.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.040]   Oh, it's expensive.
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:11.040]   But then every...
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:12.040]   That's crazy.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.040]   You save up.
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.680]   Every year you put a thousand dollars in the year of UBR.
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:16.680]   Ah.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:17.880]   You save up for your leach field.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:20.040]   I've never got a new car.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.680]   My car is now 10 years old.
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:25.240]   It's the joy of country living.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.240]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:31.480]   As we do twig this week in Google every Wednesday, it's kind of my last show of the
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:34.520]   week before my weekend, which is tomorrow and Friday.
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:35.520]   I'm going to...
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:36.520]   You have to go to Comcast.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:38.800]   I'm devoting my weekend to DMV and Comcast.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:39.800]   That's exciting.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:41.800]   That's a good time.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:44.640]   1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern time.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:47.720]   Let's see, it's 2000 UTC on the Twit Network.
