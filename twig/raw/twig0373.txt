[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.560]   week and final week. That's the sad part. My name is Jason Howell, filling in for Leo.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.280]   One last time he returns to live shows here at Twit. I believe this Saturday with the tech
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   guys. So you're going to see him definitely next week on this week in Google. Jason, go
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.960]   ahead. Go ahead. Tell the truth. You changed the locks.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.600]   Yeah. So going forward. No, I have not changed anything. I would not dare do that to Mr.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.520]   LePort. Obviously Jeff Jarvis is here, creator of Buzzmachine dot com, professor at the CUNY
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.080]   School of Journalism. How you doing, Jeff? All right. Good to be here. Good to be here.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.760]   You've been doing a great job, Jason. Glad to have you here.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.000]   Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate that. It's always a lot of fun. Also joining us is Stacey Higginbotham,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.480]   creator of the IoT podcast at IoT podcast dot com, Internet of Things newsletter at Stacey
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.760]   on IoT dot com. How are you Stacey? So well. And as you guys notice, I am traveling today.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.600]   There's a drum kit, a microphone and bookshelf. So enjoy the on spare. Oh, please pay the
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.240]   order. I'll play the drums, Stacey. Please, please. Oh, I can't. And I'm not allowed
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.000]   to touch them unless I get like basic instruction first. So yeah, I know you're saying that
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.960]   you do that. I am sitting at a piano too. Now that I can play a tune. Go ahead. Oh, hey,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   let's see. Hold on. I think this is essential. This is this is way. Okay. Hold on, you guys.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.480]   Okay. Ready?
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   This is go marching in. I didn't do the courts because I had to put your day job, Stacey.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.620]   Don't worry. That was amazing. But I really want to see you on the drum set before the
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.960]   end of the show. Maybe that can be your thing at the end of the episode is a drum fill.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.400]   Oh, I'll hold on. That's all I cost you. We have plugged Stacey. We can't hear you. Oh,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   really? Oh, now we can. There we go. Now you're back. Oh, that's cool. So everyone else missed
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.640]   my rendition of we got it. We got it. No, we've been fun of them already. It's all right.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.080]   We heard the saints go marching in and I probably couldn't play it as well as you did.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.160]   So but I'm hoping that every time Jason makes a joke, you can do a rim shot on the drums.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.440]   That would mean that your laptop would have to be set up on like a Tom or something and
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.600]   or pull that. Yes. I'm like, I'm like sitting here thinking, how could I make that happen?
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.440]   I'm just that simple. Just toss the drumstick behind you. What do you do? That work the
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.040]   first time like there we go. All right. That works. That works. Joining us here. So we kind
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.280]   of have a surprise guest here at the table. Duncan Jaffrey is the senior associate at
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.440]   Oz Droid Oz Droid net. First of all, it's great to get you on the show. Duncan. Thank
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.520]   you very much, Jason. Thank you for having us. Yeah, absolutely. You reached out to me
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.640]   a couple of weeks ago on Twitter saying that you were going to be in the area. I just did
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.600]   not put two and two together the fact that you were coming to the area for Oz Droid to
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.760]   cover Google's big hardware event yesterday and that you were going to be in here at the
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.680]   same time that I'm helping to host this week in Google. It's like all things suddenly came
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.560]   together. So my apologies to you because you literally found out like 10 minutes ago that
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   you were doing the show. No, that's perfectly fine. We kept the purpose of my visit a little
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.160]   under wraps until all the NDIs had dropped. So perfectly fine. Thanks for having me.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.240]   Yeah, absolutely. And Oz Droid.net. I'm no stranger. That's no stranger to me anyways.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.880]   Daniel Tysen's been on all that Android a decent amount of times. He always brings Australian
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.760]   goodies with him and you also did that. Tim Tams. Tim Tams. Tim Tams. Tim Tams. The big
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   pack. The value pack. So if you like Tim Tams. Oh, I do. Not one but two. Apparently this
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.960]   is like super value. And yeah, these are really delicious. They're not bad. Thank you.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.600]   They sell them at Target during the holidays. Just in case I came back from Australia with
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.960]   the craving for Tim Tams. And I was like, Oh, this is the worst. And then Target over Christmas
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.200]   Tim Tams. You also say you know, have you ever had fan tales? Fan tales. I have not.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.240]   Last time Dan was here, he brought minties, which I think a reminiscent of toothpaste.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.800]   And so it's a toothpaste based lolly. Whereas these are a far more chocolatey caramel thing.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.760]   And the little hook with these is the rappers have trivia about different movie stars and
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.760]   so forth on them. So you get a meal on a show as it were. And you get a little smarter while
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.480]   you're getting that cavity in your tooth. Another traditional Australian confectionary.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.400]   Excellent. Well, Chewy Carmel with a rich chocolate coating. If it's got chocolate in
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.520]   the name and it doesn't have any new guy. Doesn't have any new guy. All right. So Jeff
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.280]   Stacy Nougat. New get. How do you pronounce? I'm from Texas. I'm going to say nougat.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.640]   Yeah, I think we got to do a day. There you go. That's a good mashup. So does this sound
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.200]   just strange when we end up saying nougat? New gut? Yes. I mean, speaking to David Burke
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.680]   yesterday, he was very strongly in the new guy camp. So I think if Mr. Android himself
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   says new guy, I'm going to go with Android with new guy. Well, the creator of gifts says
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Jeff and I refused to go along. So no, he's wrong. Don't be on that one. No stand. I
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   mean, you know, I think the probably the right authority on this would be Google now. So
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.160]   I'm going to go ahead and do this. I did this on all of that. Android. This might drive
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.680]   the point home. What is new get? Hopefully got that. Hold on.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:13.500]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. Mm hmm. Nougat. There you go. It's been decided. It's totally the
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.200]   Jeff gift argument all over again. So the Hillary Clinton campaign would have put out
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.600]   a press release after the New York Times for the Donald Trump tax story. They said the
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.880]   gig is up. And so I was one moment he tweeted and said, no, it's it's jig unless you're trying
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.960]   to do a gift gift thing here. It's really not gig because if you have a job, it's a gig.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.720]   Yeah, that's why the gig is on work. Jig is up. Jig is up. Okay. And see now that you
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.920]   say it, I feel like I've heard both and I've just never. Is it jig like the sailor's dance?
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.080]   Where did this word come from? I guess so. I'm not even sure. Let's see. We talk about
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.720]   anything on this show. Yeah, exactly. Like etymology or pixels. Hmm. Where do we want
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.320]   to begin? Why don't we start with, I don't know, Google, which is kind of why we're all
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   here. I know. I like to keep pretty close to the Google stuff when I end up coming onto
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.840]   this week in Google. It is after all in the name. But I mean, honestly, as far as like
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.320]   days, weeks, important weeks in the year that that Google has, you know, I mean, they
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.840]   have lots of important memorable moments throughout the course of the year. This kind
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.520]   of every year, this kind of hardware announcement event is probably right at the top of the
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.800]   list of some of the most most important announcements that Google unveils. So I think it's probably
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.720]   safe to say we should talk about this and a lot because there's a lot to talk about.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.000]   First of all, you were at the event, Duncan. You were in the audience. Did you hear okay
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.800]   Google setting off millions of phones simultaneously throughout the course of the entire event?
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.960]   I can't say that I did. There might be because most people had their devices away or they
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.120]   had them on silent, but I wasn't aware of anyone in my little area I was sitting in
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:05.280]   that had any sort of interaction with the hey, Google, just our way of avoiding the
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.880]   phrase. That's the way.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.720]   So I get a lot of requests from people telling us that we should be respectful of their phones
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.280]   and their time on this sort of thing and use something that isn't the trigger word. I
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   just want to throw that out there. I know. It's really hard to remember to do that though
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   when you're talking about it. But I guess that's, you know, that's where it's our job
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.240]   to talk about it. So I guess we should be more respectful about that. I just forget.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.520]   It's not that I'm like trying to play a practical joke on people. I forget. Tells too late.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.120]   Yeah, same here. Yeah. But when we start adding control of your home with things, that's
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.240]   going to get dicey.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.520]   Dicy. It will. Absolutely. I still understand if you is this we're on this topic. If you
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:52.720]   have your phone with you and you have your your home thing there and you say the magic
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:59.720]   words, how will Google know which one? They said that only the one will respond, but how
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.040]   they know which one.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.520]   So what they said at the event is they gave an example of a house that had three different
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.120]   units in it and you had your phone on you and it will use the machine learning to detect
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.640]   what the input is, how loud it is in each speaker. And then it will just choose to use that
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.640]   input device. The question I had on that is how much lag will that be? I already experienced
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.520]   some lag when using that phrase. It will still trigger my phone surely because the phone has
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.720]   to be triggered in order to send the signal. So I still had some questions, but I think
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.280]   at least in the home itself, all of your lights might go off, but only one of them is going
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.320]   to talk back to you. But I think it was a little unclear still, Jeff, as you said, how that's
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.920]   going to work with the phone. The multi device makes complete sense, but their explanation
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.240]   on how the phone worked just didn't seem to make logical sense with how the platform works
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   now.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.840]   Right. Right. So we'll find out in the middle of November when all of our homes arrive.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.880]   Yeah. So would you okay, so obviously they announced pretty much everything that they
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.760]   announced hardware wise, we already knew leading into it. And no, you just mentioned this
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.760]   mournful moment because I always have to complain. No new pixel laptop and the pixel
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.200]   laptop is gone. And this is this is worrying me greatly. But I just wanted to get that
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.280]   on the record Google Google, are you listening Google? So what do you do in the meantime,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:28.560]   then? So you have got your pie up to dies. If it dies, I'm warped. Yeah, they aren't really
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.400]   selling the pixel to anymore. So you have to hop over to one of the outside of not made
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.320]   by Google devices. Risky. Yeah. Anyway, I just want to get that other record. We're
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.640]   always going out on the happy news. Yeah, we don't we don't have a pixel three yet.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.240]   Of course, that news was kind of bundled with the idea of this Andromeda, you know, some
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.800]   sort of a tease some sort of a demonstration or at least mentioned of the future of Android
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.360]   possibly converging with Chrome OS called Andromeda didn't hear about it in the event
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.080]   yesterday. I guess we're starting with what we didn't hear about. And in retrospect, it
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.040]   actually makes a whole lot of sense. Like it really did kind of seem strange that a product
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.520]   announcement event would also be a like a keynote event that you might find at a conference
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.080]   like Google I/O or whatever. So in hindsight, it makes a lot of sense that we didn't hear
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.520]   about that. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not happening. It also doesn't
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.880]   mean that a pixel three is not happening. It just you want to you want a crazy theory.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.080]   Yes, go. So you remember idea Intel got up on stage and even in their last earnings
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   call actually mostly at idea. They didn't talk about PCs at all because this is like
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.480]   the end of the PC world. It's all about mobile. It's all about Internet of things. It's all
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:43.200]   about cloud. So what if you think like a pixel is kind of like a input old school kind of
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.440]   PC like device, right? And you think about the merging of Chrome and Iowa not iOS. Chrome
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:57.280]   and Android. What if what if they're like, eh, let's really focus on where we're innovating
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.440]   what's new. And that's why we got the AI focus and all the kind of homey stuff and then
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.080]   the phones just thought because the phones are more about like a showcase for Google
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.280]   Assistant. If you think about it that way. Crazy idea.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.640]   I don't think that's very crazy at all. I really think like big time and they led the
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.760]   event around AI like it was pretty much what the the impression that I've gotten at since
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.920]   the event kind of concluded and everything is that Google really sees its AI as its killer
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.400]   feature. It's its killer feature of all of its hardware. Kind of saw this leading up
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.560]   to it. But the phones that they've announced which we'll talk about in a second premium
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.680]   price and a lot of people are like, well, why are they so darn expensive? Google believes
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.960]   that its version of AI, the new assistant replacing Google now at least in the Pixel
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.640]   phones at launch and exclusively in the Pixel phones at launch is one of the key marquee
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:53.800]   features that would move a true Google person who lives in the Google universe to understand
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.600]   that there's value in that higher price.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.160]   Okay. So here's my key question for the entire announcement and one of you perhaps can answer
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:08.640]   it. How is it hardware dependent? I would think that all AI is occurring up at big computers
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:17.480]   somewhere and that it's about communications and connectivity to AI based servers and
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   how they do all the work. How is this at all dependent upon the hardware of the phone?
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.120]   I don't understand that in the least. I can answer this. Go. Unless you don't want
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.280]   me to. No, it's okay. This is this is how I used to think about AI. I was like, oh,
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.440]   you train it and executions all in the cloud and you send it back down. But there are lots
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.080]   of things that require less latency. Two, there are things especially in the home where you
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.000]   want to train stuff for individual homes and you want to do it independent of an internet
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.680]   connection. Things like computer vision, if you can adjust those models like over time.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.600]   So what's going to happen is the training will still happen in the cloud for the most
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:00.360]   part still and then execution happens on the device, but execution is still really intensive.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.400]   So I guess does that answer your question? I kind of got a little sidetracked. No.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.080]   Leading on from that though, in the one of ones following the event, they did make it
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.320]   clear there's nothing unique about the pixel and the pixel Excel that would necessarily
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   mean it's the only phone capable of using the new Google Assistant. What they did say
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.840]   is that they're still, they use the term learning, the assistant's still learning, they're
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.640]   still teaching it. And one of the reasons why it's only on that one product is that
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.680]   as a feature from the search team, it's still developing, it's still building up until the
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.480]   latest release of ALO, it was still a preview review. Now that hasn't been updated yet,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.960]   I don't know if that will change, but they made it quite clear that it's not that they're
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.840]   not going to partner in future or that it won't be open to others. It's that no one
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.840]   has approached them and at the moment they're very much taking a walk before they can run
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.960]   approach with that. It doesn't help that it does differentiate their hardware amongst
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.520]   any others. Okay, so let me try a conspiracy theory here, which is that there really isn't
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.400]   any hardware dependency at all, that they're just using this as a rollout and a feature
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:12.040]   and it's a marketing thing. And if there's no hardware dependency, then do I really need
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.080]   to spend $900 by a phone? If I'm just willing to wait longer.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.640]   I don't feel like that's conspiracy theory at all. I think that's exactly what you have
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.720]   here. I mean, Google, what I've realized in thinking about the event and the announcement
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.800]   in the past 24 hours, talking about it at length yesterday all over Twitch and then
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.120]   taking a break from it is that what Google really wanted to do with this event, I think,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.520]   is Google wants to be seen on the same playing field as Apple or as Samsung about having a
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.160]   premium device that everybody really wants. And the way that they differentiate is kind
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.520]   of the same way that Samsung has tried to differentiate itself for a long time. Well-designed
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:58.080]   hardware check. Also software that's unique to itself and I think building assistant into
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.080]   that hardware specifically right now, maybe that'll open up to other hardware down the
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.560]   line and I don't see why it wouldn't. It actually makes a whole lot of sense. Why would Google
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.280]   want to keep that to just these phones? Because they're all about collecting and, you know,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.120]   aggregating all this information. So down the line, yes, it would open up. But for right
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.600]   now, the differentiating software feature for Google is assistant. I mean, there are other
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.080]   features there. But that is, I think, that is the special service that Sundar Bichai mentioned
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.760]   you know, months ago when he said that you know, Google's taking a much more focused look
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.960]   and how they're creating hardware and they're going to be more opinionated about what they
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.800]   let on their hardware. It's not it's going to be stock Android plus more. And this is
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:48.520]   part of the plus more that kind of differentiates it from everyone else. That makes sense.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.200]   If you look at the very opening of the keynote, when Sundar Bichai came out and he spoke about
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:59.880]   the evolution of computing and the paradigm changes, the two messages I took out of the
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.240]   event is exactly what Jason just said is that Google is here. They are a premium hardware
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.400]   company and they want to be seen that way. One of the reasons for the pixel name was
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.240]   to completely separate themselves from Nexus, what Nexus was. One of the quotes they gave
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.640]   was, "Nexus was the best of Android. Pixel is the best of Google." And so they made that
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.760]   very clear that, you know, pixel is premium, pixel is the best, pixel is Google. And we'll
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.240]   discuss it later in the phones. But you know, that's the reasoning they gave for a lot of
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   the differences to the Nexus sort of program we've seen in the past. But the other thing
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.200]   they're focusing in on was very clear is AI as a platform. They see that transcending the
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.520]   computer being omnipresent. And they've had this line for a while, but it came through
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:48.360]   very clearly that they actually see AI as the next iteration of computing. It's not mobile
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.280]   first anymore, it's AI first. That was the words he used. And you know, they're always
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.120]   trying to make sure they stay relevant in the next phase. And I think by taking ownership
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.360]   of AI and then extending that to others so everyone else is on their AI platform is the
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   only way they can play that. So it definitely will open, I think.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.440]   That also struck me as interesting because that was very much a geek presentation of the
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:18.320]   idea. No consumer, very few consumers rather, would understand the impact of AI on why I
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.400]   should buy this phone. Except, you know, we'll look at it and say, Oh, well, it's cool.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.560]   Got to have that. What it means. But I got to have that kind of have that, right? That's
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:31.720]   us. But real people would say what? Whereas the real impact here is that it's Google's
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.640]   kind of always argued always always always the Google is a personal services company versus
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.160]   mass media. We treat everybody the same. We give you all the same product. Google treats
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.040]   you as an individual, knows you as an individual, serves you as an individual. So now they can
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.360]   do that ever more and they can anticipate your needs. There's all kinds of ways to say that.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.320]   But saying your AI first means nothing to consumers, I would think.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.080]   Well, Google has historically been a little too nerdy in their messaging because Google
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.960]   is a much better. I mean, it's very true. Plus their hearts. And they're right that
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.720]   AI is the future. And they have one of the best platforms. Apple is terrible. And well,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.840]   it's terrible. Maybe Apple is not great at AI. In Google and Facebook are really dominating
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.000]   Microsoft has some stuff. And so I think what we're going to see here in Google has been
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.240]   aware for ages that with mobile and with computing everywhere, they're going to lose their primary
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.600]   revenue stream of ads presented on a screen after a search, right? So they knew this was
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.040]   coming. So the answer is how do you get ahead of it? And they, even years ago, talking to
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.000]   people when talking about AI, they talked about it as a way to deliver better products
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.120]   to people, better services, possibly better hardware, but mostly better Google products.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.000]   So and that's what we've been seeing. Yeah. And how do they do that to connect with the
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.960]   general consumer? Maybe AI as a buzzword isn't something that's going to pull the general
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.880]   consumer in, but personal assistant on your phone definitely does, at least that's what
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.040]   they've all been trying, you know, trying for the last few years. This is this now with
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.960]   assistant is an extension of that. So might not be marketed as AI, but it's definitely
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:17.120]   AI driving this super handy, you know, key feature of these devices. This is why you
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.080]   need it because it's going to make it just mean because there's a theory for a second.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.920]   Let's just say that there's nothing hard word dependent for AI and super duper assistant
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.520]   on the new phone. I may be wrong, but let's just say that for the second argument. If
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.240]   that's the case, what else and a camera is supposed to be a wonderful camera. All right.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.320]   So those are the two things that I heard yesterday that make this phone stand out.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:48.280]   Other than that, why should I replace my six P? Well, what do you think, Duncan? Well,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   that's a really tough sell. If I'm trying to sell you on outlying your own money. So
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.160]   yeah, having had a quite a considerable amount of time, I stayed back a little bit longer
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:05.400]   yesterday to do a lot of mucking around where I could with both of the devices. Look, the
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.080]   overall build quality of the phone is amazing. I think partnering with HTC, who are known
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   to be exceptional at manufacturing great devices when they want to. Their prowess from the
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.280]   M7 onwards was very evident in the construction of the device. The antenna lines, the zero
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.480]   gap, you can run your finger over that and you know, you'll need younger hands and mind
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.000]   to detect anything other than a completely smooth interface. A little bit of glass at
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.800]   the top really did offset it. So, you know, overall, you can see that someone has obsessively
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.840]   designed. I was very worried with the early renders that it would have an angular feel
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.000]   and angular back. And now look, the front does have a bit of an angular bezel. You don't
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.760]   touch that. If I had any complaint, it would be the button stuck out a little bit too much,
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.280]   but then I've complained that other phones, they didn't stick out enough. So I'm not really
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:00.600]   going to complain about that. The, but that's criticism of how well this phone is done.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.520]   In terms of going to the market and saying you're going to spend $650 to $800, it was
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:14.680]   a $900 on the phone. What do you think? Convincing a gen, the general consumer that this is on
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.720]   par with the top of the line phones out there. So I reviewed the night seven and I'd put
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   them as equal to five. I did. Mine never had any issues except the fact that they took
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:32.760]   it off me. That was an issue I had with it. The camera launched just as fast. The images
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:40.920]   shot just as fast in wildly whipping the phone around the room to different focal deaths,
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.120]   different lighting situations. I was rarely able to get the camera to fault and create
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.040]   a less than acceptable. On the Pixel phones. On the Pixel phones. Which is the kind of
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.160]   test we did with the note as well. It was a great camera. This is the camera that Google
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:01.600]   hardware fans and ex-spans had been waiting for. It is delivered. It was fast. It was slick.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.280]   I can't fault it. Will it work every single time and every photo? No. But what camera
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:11.960]   will? Right. So Stacey, you have an order. Are you going to? No, no, I'm not going to
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:17.400]   be able to get the camera. I am actually not a huge mobile phone adopter. So I'm content
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.760]   to wait another year. You never leave your home because you're always IOT. So you have
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.360]   to be at home so you're just not mobile? Exactly. No. I'm outside of my home right now.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.840]   I mean, someone else is home. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I think you just brought
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.400]   in some sets from Ikea. Just to make us leave. This is just another room that you left. Yes.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.080]   So yeah, I'm not going to order this phone just because it's expensive. I'm content with what I
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:49.480]   have it. I mean, I judge a device based on, can I, this is sad? I'm so lame. Can I text with it?
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:55.160]   Can I open the apps I need to do to test my home gadgets? And does it offer geo-fencing?
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:02.920]   I mean, it's so lame. It is Stacey. I know you guys are like, God, why do we even have you on the show?
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.040]   Don't even know what to say now. So I'm your normal person when it comes to phones.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:14.680]   I mean, do you place high value on things like a camera in the phone that you have?
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.040]   Because I mean, the only thing you say the best camera you have is the one you have on you.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.720]   Right. And I'm totally that person. Yeah. I mean, God, you guys would hate me. I was actually
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:30.360]   looking at the, so I had a theory for you, Jeff. This is the first phone to have the Qualcomm 821
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.160]   Snapdragon 821 chip. And so I was looking at the specs on that chip to see if there was anything
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:43.560]   specific to machine learning or kind of any. That's why we love you. You look for the specs on the chip.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.920]   Well, that's great. I would never think to do that. And I wouldn't know what I was looking at.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.040]   So thank you. So what'd you find? I found nothing related to machine learning. That's the downside.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.280]   I mean, it's a 64 bit CPU, but that's not new. It's a little bit faster.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.040]   It's got a nice graphics core for image processing, but nothing that made me go,
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.320]   "Holy cow, this is what it is." So sorry. I failed you.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.440]   So then the other thing from yesterday, when you guys were talking about it, as I was watching you,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.400]   you, Jason, particularly had concern about the Verizon as you could, you could probably channel
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:26.040]   me that a Verizon? Yeah. Yeah. But the one I ordered online is, as I understand it, is just an
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.240]   unlocked phone that also does buy. So it's not really an issue. It's only going to be sold to
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.440]   Verizon, but I can use it on AT&T. Well, here's my concern with Verizon. This is definitely
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.560]   something that I want to make sure we talk about because there's a few different levels on this.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:46.120]   My main concern is if Google's intention, if their ambition with this is to come out with this
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:52.440]   new lineup of phones that Hiroshi Lakhheimer said on Twitter alluded to something about this being
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.800]   at least looked back upon in the future as a historic moment, much in the same way that the
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.360]   launch of Android was eight years ago. I don't know if I necessarily buy that, but I think part of
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.320]   part of his reason for saying that is that this is the point in Google's history where Google takes
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:14.200]   control over its hardware and puts a stamp, puts hardware out there that they hope can be seen on
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.640]   the same level as something like Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy devices. If their goal is to do
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   that, if what they want is market penetration, they want people, not just enthusiasts who are fans of
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:31.000]   Google and Nexus and all that, they want everybody to suddenly consider this a real player in the
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.320]   field, then they need to position their devices in the places that consumers are going. And if you've
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.360]   got a Verizon exclusive, that's not going to reach everybody. That's going that totally
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.160]   like it's their reach. Selling it through the store is fine. Through their online presence is fine.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.560]   Selling it through Best Buy, that's great. People can go into Best Buy. But so many people get these
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:57.880]   phones through the carriers that if you're only showing it at a Verizon, then you're going to lose
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.800]   in your ambitions of making this a fully penetrated device that everybody wants. It's just not going
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.920]   to happen. Maybe they don't want to do that the first one out the game. Maybe that could be the case.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:15.480]   Although I did see, so I think the Verge was reporting that the Verizon version of this will
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.760]   not have Verizon crap wear on it. So that was
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:24.840]   hopeful. Although you won't be able to get it until Tuesday, I believe, when you can order it.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.120]   Oh, yesterday was Tuesday. Can you order it on Verizon now?
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.720]   I don't know. I haven't looked into that. Is it this Tuesday or last
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.680]   yesterday, Tuesday, when I travel, I forget all days. Yeah, understood. Duncan, you and I were
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:42.200]   talking about this a little bit prior to the show. And you were kind of positing that maybe
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:48.680]   part of the Verizon exclusivity. Maybe there's something in that deal that dictated the fact that
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.440]   they that you would be able to get instant updates on these devices and that maybe there
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.160]   wouldn't be bloatware on there. Yeah, we were discussing that with them. It seems to be in all
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.440]   the launch markets they've partnered with just one carrier and a lot of instances it seems to be
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.600]   in a vertical, the premium carrier. Certainly in Australia, they've partnered with Telstra,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.120]   which has a love hat relationship, very similar to Verizon with many of their customers.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.880]   And so I wonder if by making those exclusive deals, you're the only ones to have the best
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.880]   Android phone, the Google phone, if they leverage that, Tuesday, but you don't touch it. You sell
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   it, but there is no carrier branding. There is no bloatware. There is no contacts apps.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.800]   It is as it comes. You let the updates go straight through to us, to the customers,
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:43.000]   just like Apple does. They launched their first phone with a single provider. Maybe it's a similar
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.560]   program. Maybe their hope is to get it right this first time and then say to everyone else,
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:53.640]   "Right. If you want this same deal, you can have it. Have an exclusive one year and then the following
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.520]   years, perhaps everyone else will comply." Yeah, and that's the hope. That's certainly been
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.240]   one of the challenges for Android in general, the deal that made with the devil years and years
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.120]   ago, where you get these Android devices on all the platforms and you don't get the fast updates,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.960]   who's a fault there? That can be debated, but in this case, it's Google behind the scenes.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:19.160]   And they are touting this from a promotional standpoint as being updates as fast as they come
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.880]   from Google direct from Google. So if they've got it on the Verizon platform, I have to imagine
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:29.240]   if that's their marketing that's going to ring true for Verizon. And then the other
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.440]   complaint is of course that bloatware also Verizon is really good about making sure that their Verizon
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.240]   logo is somewhere on the phone. It's usually very, very big and an eyesore. Any images that
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:44.840]   we've seen here do not show that. So maybe that's part of the deal. Maybe the fact is, this time,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:50.040]   Google did what it needed to do to work out that relationship in the same way that Apple was able
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:55.400]   to do years ago. And with the same announcement of where they'd be retiled, where they'd be through
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:00.760]   carrier stores, they said you were getting the update straight from us, monthly updates.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:07.880]   So you can't-- That is key. You can't say that. And then, but that's only for these devices.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.360]   If that's the case, they needed to make that clear. It's not Google branded then. Stacey,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.160]   you can order it on Verizon. Interestingly, Jason, the blue is still available there.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.960]   Oh, OK. I did read somewhere that there was some sort of a blue exclusivity through Verizon,
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.680]   even though I was able to order it on the store yesterday. Could you order the bigger one, the 128
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.040]   gigabytes? No, so they can-- So as far as I can get, that's only a 32.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:37.240]   OK. It's only like 32 in the blue. Same with Verizon. OK. Well, I can rush over to Verizon's store,
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:43.560]   or I could actually sacrifice myself in order, because I'm a Verizon customer. But that's so
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:51.800]   expensive. I'll think about it. I'm buying an iPhone or a device testing. So I'm like,
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:59.960]   oh, man. Yeah. Here you go. So 649 for 32 gig model, the regular Pixel 749 for 128 gigs.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:07.320]   Pixel XL costs 769 for 32 gigs, 869 for 128 gigs. And then you have the three colors, quite black,
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:13.720]   very silver, and really blue, which is a limited edition. Thankfully, I was able to get the really
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   blue one before it sold out yesterday. I got the-- I was nervous about 32, because my current one
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:26.200]   has 64. So I went with the 128 and spent another 100 bucks. Yeah. Right. But you know, they're
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.960]   saying there's a little bit of this kind of like next bit theory going on here or ethos going on
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.520]   here, where they're saying if you get these Pixel devices, you're not going to run out of space,
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:42.120]   because as soon as you get low, the device has smarts to automatically get rid of your older stuff
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.320]   that's already backed up to the cloud photos, right? Photos and videos, they said, and it'll do
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.280]   it dynamically. So the way they explained it is, let's say you've got a photo from eight months
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   ago, you're always going back to the favorite photo of your wife and child, for instance.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.160]   That one will stay because you keep accessing it. But everything around it, everything since it,
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.880]   will just get siphoned off the phone. And if that's not enough, they said in the one-on-one
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   briefings afterwards that on the Pixel device, that secret source goes a little bit deeper. They
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.760]   didn't give us a demo. It's not quite to the next bit level where it just automatically handles
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.320]   these things and offloads app and offloads this. And then when you wanted it magically appears,
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.280]   but there it's going to have a new wizard that will prompt you and say, hey, you're running out of
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.160]   space. There's not enough photos to get rid of. You haven't used this app in some time. They didn't
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.720]   go into a lot of detail, but they're certainly putting a little bit more intelligent into the
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:41.960]   smarts around memory management beyond just automatically, dynamically offloading your photos
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:49.000]   and videos, which when I're offloaded will be an original content. Yeah, including the 4K videos.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.640]   So here's what I've been complaining about now.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.520]   What, Jeff? Well, so...
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.400]   Which account is a good news?
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.360]   Right.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:04.920]   Well, that's exactly the problem. So because the various things came out on regular Google
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.680]   accounts, before apps accounts, all my photos are under my regular Google account.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:15.560]   And so I guess I need to move them over to my apps account, but who or pardon me now? G-Suite
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.840]   account? G-Suite, yes. Or pardon me for this, but I can't help thinking it's the G-spot account.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:26.920]   That's okay, because whenever they say YouTube read, you know what I think of.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.640]   Right, exactly. So...
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:37.480]   What was the... When the iPad came out, there was a lot of... Gina was talking about that as well,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:43.800]   that it was a reference. But anyway, I don't know that. So I don't know what's going to happen with
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.000]   all the assistant stuff and all that on the account. So I'm having this nervousness that I'm
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.720]   going to start setting it up and it's going to get all... McGilla again. Yeah. We'll see. Why need to come?
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:35:00.040]   That's something to deal with with Google Home too. So we can complain again,
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.640]   complain and do about which account it's going to learn from. I mean, is the problem?
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.920]   Do you think that it won't handle apps accounts? I don't know. I don't really know.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.920]   I don't know what it's going... I don't know what it's going... I don't know what it's going...
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:16.120]   If history has told us anything, we probably already know the answer. Let's talk about Home
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:21.880]   Next, but before we do that, we have to thank the sponsor of today's episode, then we'll get
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:27.400]   into all that. Of course, Jeff Jarvis talking all about yesterday's events, Stacy Higginbotham,
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.960]   and then joined here at the table by Duncan Jaffrey. Really appreciate you dropping in,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.760]   giving us your insight from the event. Thank you. Real quick here. I want to thank the sponsor
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:42.680]   of today's episode that is Hover. It's for when you have a great idea, your blog or startup, you
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:48.840]   want a great domain name. It's kind of pivotal. It's important to the whole process with Hover.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   It's incredibly easy to set up your domain name with the most popular website builders. Hover has
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:02.120]   over 400 domain extensions. All the classics, of course, you've got all their albums.com.net.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:09.800]   But then all those indie domain extensions as well. Things like .pizza.ninja.horse.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:15.560]   All of it. Think of it and it probably exists. Once you find your domain, use Hover Connect to
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:21.160]   set up your domain automatically with your website in just a few clicks. You can also use it to get
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:27.640]   a more on-brand or professional email address and domain works with whatever email programs
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.760]   you already are using. When all you want to do is buy a domain name or an email address,
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:38.760]   you shouldn't have to opt out of page after page of add-ons that you don't want or you don't need.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.960]   That's why Hover only offers domains and email. That's so that you can focus on finding a great
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.600]   domain name and then get back to working on your great idea, the most important part of all.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   Unlike most other domain providers, Hover includes free WhoIs privacy with all supported domains to
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.880]   keep your information confidential. If you already have multiple domains scattered across other
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:05.480]   domain providers, you can save money by bringing them all over to Hover. With volume discounts,
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.280]   the more domains you have in your account, the more of a discount Hover will automatically
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.560]   apply to your account. So you're incentivized there to just bring it on over. Find the perfect
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:22.920]   domain name for your idea. Go to Hover.com. You can use promo code TWIG. That's TWIG at checkout
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:29.320]   to save 10% off your first purchase. That's Hover.com. Use promo code TWIG at checkout and
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:36.680]   we thank Hover for their support of this week in Google. So I would say there were the phones,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:42.920]   which was a big deal. There was also Google Home, which we knew all this stuff was coming,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.240]   but personally, I'm very excited about Google Home. I placed the order yesterday during the
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:53.080]   live coverage. Stacey, did you also order during coverage? I just ordered one though.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   Okay. Well, I mean, yeah. I held back. Okay. This is restraint. I appreciate that. Jeff,
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.280]   did you get one? Oh, never mind. Never mind. Well, I'll ask you in a second, Jeff. What about
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:10.760]   you, Duncan? They're not available in Australia. Australia. Australia. That whole thing. That whole
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:16.360]   thing of US only probably. Yes. Maybe limited to US and maybe in a few other places. I actually
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.920]   didn't notice who is getting home initially. I think it is just US only. I don't think even
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:26.680]   Canada. Canada did not get it. I had some Canucks who were like, "Ah." However,
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:34.280]   sorry. Unofficially, they did hint several of the Googlers there hinted that there will be
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:40.520]   expansion plans, unlike on hub that never really grew or went anywhere. The Google Home,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:46.280]   they have definite expansion plans, and they have expansion plans this market cycle.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:52.200]   Even hinted that maybe for people in first tier pixel markets who didn't get it this time around,
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:57.880]   so if you got a pixel and you didn't get a home, maybe you should keep watching the news until
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:03.400]   closer to the end of this year and start looking for items closer to the beginning of next year.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.680]   The hinting they were saying is that perhaps if all goes well and the assistant works and it's
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.840]   all hinging on the assistant, that's the reason they don't want to take it wider. If assistant
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:18.120]   works well, they will open up the news later this year that it's going to go wider. Sales
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:25.400]   will become available for early 2017. All in-officially all in-prolises. Would it work or would they
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:31.880]   geo-fence it? Well, you know- The Echo is geo-fenced. Only some things can work in other countries
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.360]   where it's not supported. I don't know what Google will do. It could be training around accents or
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.640]   languages with the pixel, you think? They said that was one of the issues, both with training
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:47.240]   it to hear and training it to speak, picking up dialects and co-opial expressions and being able
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:52.840]   to respond in a conversational way. But if I know my editor-in-chief Daniel Tyson, he will-
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.160]   if he can't import one, he will get on a plane, come over here, buy it from Best Buy,
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:02.680]   get back on the plane and come back. So we should be able to test one in Australia relatively soon.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.720]   I mean, you could throw it off the path with like a VPN though, right?
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:12.280]   I mean, that works for the most part with tech like this. It does. Coming from the land down
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.240]   under, we have a lot of VPN requirements depending on what we're doing. So, yep.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.880]   Jeff, did you order a Google Home when you were able to?
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:28.360]   Yeah, I did. I did. I did. I put myself on the waiting list for the whatever they're calling the
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:34.440]   goggles and the Wi-Fi. Well, you know, the goggles actually are included. Come free with the phone.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.360]   If you've provided your phone. Yeah, so I didn't realize that. So you get it, you get a code
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   like a month before the photo arrives, it said. Oh, is that how it how it worked? I didn't see
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.080]   exactly how it worked. I just knew that you can't go to the goggles yet, right? I don't believe
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.440]   you can't know. And so, yeah, you'll get a you'll get a promo code for a big 79 bucks after
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.120]   it's been 900 bucks. They should throw in the 79 bucks. Yeah, let's see here. I did. Yeah,
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:05.880]   it's a join the wait list for daydream view. So let's see here, but before we talk about view,
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.080]   maybe that made more sense with the phone, but let's talk about home because that's really super
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.640]   exciting. Home voice assistant, obviously, and I think it's very interesting that it sounds like
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.760]   what they're doing in some ways is limiting based on the fact that they want to see how
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:24.280]   assistant does before pushing it out. That's a great way to kind of control your your live beta
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.240]   test, although they probably don't want to call it a beta test, even though to some degree,
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:33.080]   it's kind of sounds like maybe it is growing pains growing pains. It's probably better.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.280]   I mean, there isn't a whole lot that we didn't already know about home voice assistant,
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:44.760]   a set of microphones. They've done a lot of work on the fear of farfield voice recognition machine
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:50.120]   learning that will actively filter background noise, minimize error rates. They say it's the best
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:57.320]   in class voice recognition. All sorts of controls, obviously, you can control all Chromecast devices
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.840]   with it, Nest smart things, music services like Spotify, Google Play music, Pandora, iHeartRadio
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.960]   YouTube. If this than that, Netflix, I think by extension through Chromecast, Phillips Hue,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   and I think that's about it. But Stacey, you are you've got your head firmly kind of your
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.040]   you're always thinking about the Internet of Things. Are you happy with what you saw with
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.960]   Google Home? Are there obvious downsides to what you saw? There are so the biggest pro will be
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.520]   talking to Google as opposed to Bing, which is what happens when you talk to the Echo.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:37.080]   Ah, there you go. I'm totally serious. Yes, I know it's.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:45.160]   Multicasting is probably great for a lot of people. And because it will talk to Chromecast,
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:52.440]   the if you stick a Chromecast audio in the auxiliary port of your Sono speaker, that should also
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:58.040]   allow you to control it. So in a way, that's like a kind of hacky way to get around to your Sonos
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:04.840]   without having to run a Raspberry Pi all the time. So that's a pro. The things that I didn't hear
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.640]   that I want to hear, I want to hear how it actually sounds. These demos like you brought up yesterday,
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:14.360]   they all have a different voice. So I'm like, is this just pre recorded? What's the latency
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:21.880]   like on that? How effective is it when I say the wake words? How many times will it wake up on
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.760]   its own and be like creeping me out? So those are some things. The others are there's not a lot
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.600]   of partners so far. I think we're going to see a lot more. I hope we're going to see a lot more.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:36.760]   But right now, only if this and that smart things, Phillips, you and Nest. Is there one more? Did I
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:42.280]   miss one? That's pretty much it. I mean, outside of like Chromecast, you know, outside of Chromecast.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.600]   So I want to see Logitech Harmony. I really want to see Wink. I want to see
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:54.280]   I want to see Ecobee. I mean, so many devices I want to see. And you could. Sorry. I was going to
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:59.880]   say you could do them with if this and that, but that's got so much latency. I mean, it's just
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:04.840]   ridiculous. So what does that depend upon Stacey for the for those brands you just mentioned to
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.200]   write to the API or for Google to invite them in? What's the gaming? So that's unclear.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.240]   To do any of these integrations, you have to have both parties decide to work together. So
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.560]   there's going to be an API kind of issue or an SDK issue depending on how they're going to link
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:26.680]   them. So that's one. But the other thing may be that Google's just not ready to bring in all
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:34.360]   this other stuff because they don't know how well home is going to work. Oh, in Logitech Harmony
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.520]   might actually be competitive with Chromecast TV, like the Chromecast stuff on the television
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.880]   because you could be like Google play Stranger Things on Netflix as the demo they showed and
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:49.560]   your TV just was like, blah, blah, Stranger Things. And if that happens, then why would they want
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.760]   Logitech Harmony? Easy views for consumer. But I don't know. I was about to say except for
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:01.000]   the consumers, but clearly we don't care about the consumer. Oh, them. Oh, those bothersome people.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.520]   So you're going to end up with this with this clutter around the house. So one question is,
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:15.000]   should Google have designed a home to have the Wi-Fi router in it? Should that be an option?
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.120]   You know, a super duper one they should they should offer in the future? Yeah, I wondered about
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.440]   that too. That costs a lot of money. Kevin and I talked about that on the show. So
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:32.520]   I would have loved it, but a lot of people still stick their routers in like in the mesh networks,
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.160]   you stick your your little access points that are mesh network routers all around the house. But
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:45.000]   in a traditional setup, your router is usually in a closet. So that's one thing. Two things,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.360]   two things. I don't know what the second thing is. Oh, it would be super expensive because
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:55.800]   it's true. All the computing power that all these things need, although I think these routers
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:01.480]   actually have some decent computing power in them. So maybe you would use is that the last Google
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.360]   router is compatible with the mesh network. Yes. And I don't know why Google didn't talk about that.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.680]   The on hub, you could actually, if you have an on hub, you can add a Google Wi-Fi mesh network
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:18.120]   router to your on hub and just go to town. Good. Good for all those people who bought an on hub
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:23.160]   and expected some sort of promised software updates, including you Jeff. So all you need to get
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:30.040]   is a Google Wi-Fi. They're they're just announced router and mesh that together with
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.600]   your on hub and you've got solid Wi-Fi throughout your home. If you don't already.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.960]   So Stacy, my other question is, I think that I saw yesterday, we talked about this couple
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:47.800]   weeks ago, after I owe Google wants home to be built into other devices. Yes.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.920]   That isn't clear. So that's well,
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:59.320]   this is actually something I was in San Francisco last week. And I talked about with a lot of the
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:07.320]   people there, but Google's natural language processing API or API or yeah, API, they don't really make
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:13.000]   that available. Some companies have access to it, but most companies don't. They're not pushing it
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.360]   like Amazon is with their let the she who should not be named program. They've just launched a
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:25.000]   two point, is it a $2.5 million prize for making things both conversational. So Amazon's clearly
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.680]   pushing that. Google so far doesn't have anything, but it's really early. The device isn't even
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.440]   out yet. So yeah, and they did mention so they talked a little bit about this.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.680]   Towards the end, basically the SDK where they're saying, you know, you can bring assistant to third
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:48.680]   party hardware do next year and leading up to that, they had what was it? The actions on Google,
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:53.480]   which is direct actions for things like home automation, media requests, communication,
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.400]   and then conversational actions that people can work can program in. For example, you know,
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.880]   the example I was able to find was I needed an Uber. Where would you like to go to work?
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:10.520]   Like an Uber X again. But that is not to be built into other devices, which is kind of what Jeff's
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:15.480]   talked about. So this is just an expansion of it in general, assistant on the software side that
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:20.200]   developers can do. And then starting next year, some sort of SDK access for developers to kind
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:27.000]   of do their third party hardware thing. So isn't there a war that occurs between among
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.400]   Google and Amazon? And I would guess at some point, Apple is going to have to compete with Siri
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:43.480]   in this world, right? Oops. Oops. Sorry. What did I say? I don't have to try to figure that out.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:49.720]   No, you said you said the name S-I-R-I. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Something the other she who
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.720]   must not be named. Yeah. That's right. So many things we can't say on this show. Dang it.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.160]   So dang it. That's a good answer. Yeah, that's a bad word.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:04.200]   So, but you know, Google's Android strategy was to get Android built into everything. And of course,
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:10.600]   now they're trying to different tack. But for home, an assistant, I would think that they want to
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:15.080]   build it into everything. They can just be the strategy that they do. They did say during the
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.960]   keynote that it would be available on everything from a Raspberry Pi all the way through to third
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:27.880]   party consumer devices. So, you know, if you want to tinker, the SDK will be available and you can
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:34.600]   build assistant into a Raspberry Pi home. Sorry, into it. How well that works, we'll wait and see.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.880]   But, you know, I think they are serious. And again, I think it's a walk before they can run
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.520]   the, they're really wanting to learn rapidly. They want to teach this assistant, the AI, how things
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:52.280]   work. I think it is their next ecosystem play. So I, you know, I think it will be opened.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.480]   Yes, it would have to be. I mean, Google's an open company. That makes sense that it would
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:03.080]   be open. I've talked to companies like smart home companies who are already talking to Google
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.800]   about it and have been before the announcement. So I don't think they're going to be shut out.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:16.040]   The only company right now that shuts people out is like is Apple. So like if you have a home
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:21.800]   kit certified device, you know, it can't run like the thread protocol radios, sorry, the thread
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:27.720]   radio. And so there's some rules and stuff associated with Apple that closes things out, but both
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:34.600]   Amazon and Google are seemingly going open. So let's talk business model here for a second.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:40.120]   Let's imagine just for the sake of it that there's a wonderfully open world and you can buy a generic
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:45.160]   device, you know, like it's also a cable box and a Wi-Fi router and a garage door opener.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:53.400]   And let's say you could get both Google Home Assistant and, by the way, are really dull names,
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:51:01.560]   and Amazon's, what's your name, on the same device, right? And that you can call upon either.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:09.480]   Amazon makes money here by delivering you goods and content. Google makes money how?
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:18.520]   Sucking your information on and delivering it to, I don't know, advertisers, or it could be on
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.840]   you buying more services from them right now. They're really, I mean, think about YouTube,
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:29.960]   Red, and they're charging people for the ad-free version of that. There's the hardware efforts.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.440]   I think we're going to see a lot more services from Google. And then the other thing is they might be
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.840]   outsourcing some of this to other companies. So like what we haven't seen yet in the smart home
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.680]   space, and I'm not saying Google will do this, but it certainly is in the running if it wants to be,
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:52.440]   we don't have a model that installs and manages and secures everything associated with the smart home,
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:57.000]   for example. And that's a big need if we actually want this to become a viable business, right? So
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.760]   Comcast is like, hey, we'll do it all. ADT is the same way. Google could actually come in and do that
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:10.280]   either itself, which is less likely, or through ways it governs its third party ecosystem players.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.040]   So if you're imagining that you want to connect something to Google Assistant,
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.960]   or you want to use like Weave or Brillo, if you have to, in order to enable those things on your
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:24.200]   device, if you have to like come in through the Google Cloud, that's a way for them to guarantee
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:29.800]   security, for example, and maybe some basic levels of functionality. That's what Apple does with HomeKit.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:35.560]   And that's a little far out there, but it's worth thinking about. And there they may make money,
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:41.800]   either charging consumers a service fee on top of it, or maybe just by shoving people to their cloud.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.280]   And they don't take any money. When you say to one of these devices, get me an Uber,
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.680]   nobody's taken a cut of that. Now,
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:56.520]   but they do get to train AI. I mean, if they really do think AI is first,
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:03.880]   and the next big thing, every single time you do a voice search, every single time you correct a
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:09.240]   voice search, it learns it gets better. It goes into the data pool. Every single data point is
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:14.760]   useless. A million data points less so. And yet back to what Stacy said, it'll build a better
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.840]   advertising profile. You're still going to have a screen. You're still going to be accessing the
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:24.600]   web on whatever screen we have in the future, whether it's a glass, a phone, a hologram, your TV.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.480]   As long as this screen model exists and Google exists in it, the more data they get on you,
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:34.360]   the richer the ads, the more targeted content that they can serve on behalf of other people,
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:39.560]   and they sell that service. They never sell your details. They sell the ability to access
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:48.600]   demographics. But the ability to train an AI with crowdsourced data, in a real
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:55.000]   live data, and then maybe they can sell AI as a service to business or to other people.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:04.840]   Right. So in my business and news, we're not going to know how to be conversational. We're
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:09.400]   going to do a bad job of that. We're not going to know how to have user profiles. We're not going
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.960]   to know lots of things. So play with that a little bit more. If you were to sell AI as a
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:28.840]   service, which would be A I A S. A I as a right, A I A S. I S. If you were to sell I
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:33.400]   what would that look like? What would the services be? That's really interesting.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:39.960]   So if we will use your example then, so your media outlet, you're big enough to afford these
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:46.440]   sorts of things, and you're wanting to have perhaps automatic articles written. We know they're not
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.960]   just doing speech. They're doing text. Perhaps it elects that to be auto-generated, and they can
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:58.280]   sell you the ability to spin up a TensorFlow and have whatever the other plugin name, whatever it is,
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   have this massive conversational database, be able to pass information, then to be able to
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:10.760]   bring that out in a different way. You could be in customer service. All of these chat bots that
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.920]   we see in customer service bots, they're horrible. I haven't used any bot that I like.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:21.960]   And I saw the glimmer yesterday of being able to, I don't need to know a bot. I just say to my
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:28.280]   phone, I want something. So I say I need to talk to AT&T. Well, if AT&T is paid for the bot,
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:33.080]   the bot I interact there is rich. It talks to me. It's like a real person. I have a conversation.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.840]   Now, hopefully it's a little bit better than I want an Uber. Where are you going?
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.600]   Because I just pull that Google Maps, tap the destination, and tap travel by Uber. And that
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:46.680]   takes me about 10 seconds. You're right. But the dread is we're going to be talking to a voice
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:53.880]   that's just like a phone mail jail. So I think what people in our excitement over voice, what
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:58.920]   we're neglecting is that voice isn't good for everything. And I think a lot of people, like
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:06.200]   developers know that. So we talked about this yesterday, but in some of the Google Home examples,
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.240]   it was like, give me directions or where can I buy winter clothing and something about like
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:16.120]   here are the three stores, give me directions to one of those. And if Google just, if the Google
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.520]   Home just says that to you, that sucks. But if it sends that type of information to your phone,
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:26.600]   that's really interesting. So I think we'll see more of that. And I was going to throw out some
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:32.920]   data because a company called Unomi that does smart home software that brings everything together,
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:38.280]   and many of your devices together in kind of an intelligent thing. That was a terrible thing for
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:45.160]   your home. They said that only about 30% of their interactions are via voice. And about
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:52.680]   50%, 55% or 60% are through traditional automations. And then like 12 are from your
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:59.880]   phone widgets. So I think voice is going to become a greater than that, but it won't ever become
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   everything. The same AI should be. Oh, I think you're muted suddenly. Oh, there we go.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:11.160]   The same AI should be able to power any engine in time. So however you choose to interface.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:17.960]   That learning set, the more they know, the more they see them, or they do just their ability to
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:32.200]   mimic conversational human style reactions. I just want one. I've been following this conversation.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.960]   I don't have anything to add to it. This is pretty fascinating. I still can't believe you don't
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:41.720]   have an echo. Yeah. Well, I mean, I was waiting. I don't have one either. I was waiting. Yeah,
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.080]   exactly. I kind of got to the point where I was like, you know what, I need to get an echo.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:48.680]   And then I went to Google I/O and they shut off Google Home. And I was like, oh, well,
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:53.320]   I guess I don't. I'm going to wait. Oh, well, Google did its job by pre-enouncing the home.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:59.720]   Good word. Yeah. True. Emmon seven in the chat room gave an interesting example using AI to
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:07.160]   replace human court reporters or perhaps reporters in recorders in political situations.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:12.680]   Once it gets beyond that, you know, I don't think there are candidates spoke about the
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:19.640]   getting from 87% efficiency to 92 and how difficult it was. But, you know, when they train it on 100,000,
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:25.000]   a million people saying all of these things every day, does that data set get them to 96,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.960]   97, 98, 99? Well, the big leap in voice recognition was actually in the computing side in the back end,
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:40.760]   as opposed to training sets. But it's possible that greater, greater sources of training data will
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.920]   boost us the rest of the way. And although I think it'll be merged, won't it?
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:50.600]   Yes. But there's also like body language. Like, I think they say people only under actually
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:55.880]   understand like 96 92 or 96% of the words and the rest we just make up with body language.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:04.040]   So for what that's worth. Let's see here, we should probably take a break. We haven't even
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:09.800]   talked about everything from the event at this point. We still have VR. I don't know if VR is
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:14.280]   super exciting. Everybody on this panel, I know I'm excited about VR, at least I seem to be getting
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:19.320]   more and more excited as the year of VR progresses. I feel like this has been a big year for that.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:24.360]   Google showed off the dream view. We'll talk about that in a second. But before we do that,
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:30.840]   let's get hungry. It's time to thank the sponsor, Blue Apron, whose mission is to make incredible
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:36.680]   home cooking accessible to everyone. Also supporting a more sustainable food system, setting the
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:42.040]   highest standards for ingredients and building a community of chefs, basically making you a better
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:47.320]   chef. Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along with fresh high quality ingredients to make delicious
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:52.920]   home cooked meals. Every meal comes with a step by step, easy to follow recipe card inside the box
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:59.000]   and pre-portioned ingredients that can be prepared in 40 minutes or less. You'll save time and save
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.920]   money. When you're shopping at the grocery store, that's 60% more expensive than what you get with
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:10.520]   Blue Apron. You're going to spend under $10 per person for healthy home cooked meals. How does that
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.400]   compare to, say, eating out or going to a high-end grocery chain? It's a lot less than what you'll
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:20.200]   spend. Customize your recipes every week based on your dietary preferences and choose a delivery
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.400]   option that fits your needs. There's no weekly commitment, so you only get deliveries when you
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:31.960]   want them. Blue Apron delivers to 99% of the continental US and sets the highest quality standards for
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:38.040]   their community. They have over 150 local farms, fisheries, ranchers across the US, so you're going
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:44.120]   to get seafood that's sourced sustainably, beef that's raised humanely, chickens, a free range,
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:50.440]   pork is raised naturally, and also regenerative farming practices used for produce. They're shipping
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.320]   the exact amount required for these recipes. So not only are they reducing food waste, it actually
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:59.720]   makes putting these recipes together pretty simple because you have exactly what you need
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.800]   to match up with what's on the card. Whether it's Japanese ramen noodles, wild cod,
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:09.640]   Alaskan salmon, or heirloom tomatoes, Blue Apron brings you the best. And not only that,
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.360]   it's supporting a more sustainable food system. It's supporting happy and healthy families,
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.920]   because when you cook together, you know, build strong family bonds. Blue Apron families cook
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:25.480]   nearly three times more often. New recipes created every week by Blue Apron's culinary team. They're
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:31.160]   not repeated within the year. So they really keep it fresh week after week. You've got crispy chicken
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.360]   milanets with warm brussel sprouts, celery and potato salad, Thai green curry chicken and squash
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:43.080]   with yu choy, jasmine rice and cashews, roasted pork steam buns with black garlic mayonnaise and
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:50.040]   spicy cabbage slaw and seared salmon and fall vegetable hash with apple brown butter dressing.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.000]   All of that, all of those, you know, those are all recipes that you make when you sign up for
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.720]   Blue Apron. You get to learn how to make those and a whole lot more. Check out this week's menu
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:05.240]   and get your first three meals free with free shipping by going to Blue Apron.com/Twit. You're
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.880]   going to love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home cook meals with Blue Apron.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:15.080]   So don't wait, visit Blue Apron.com/Twit and check it out for yourself when we thank Blue Apron
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:22.840]   for their support of this week in Google. We talked about home, we talked a little bit about the Wi-Fi,
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.640]   the mesh network, which I'm definitely excited about. We haven't talked at all about Daydream. We
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.000]   wondered if we were going to hear a little bit about VR, obviously under the hood on Nougat, Nougat,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.320]   is VR support in the form of something Google calls Daydream. We got more details on that.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:46.120]   The version of Android that's shipping with these phones is 7.1 and that includes support for Daydream
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:52.040]   officially under the hood. These are the first devices to be to follow the Daydream spec. And along
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.320]   with that, if you preorder like we mentioned earlier, you get a free Daydream view headset,
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:05.000]   which is essentially Google's own version of this headset to get you started. And it's very
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.360]   different because it's covered in cloth. Now you were at the event, Duncan. Did they have these
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.080]   for hands-ons? And if so, what did you think? They did. So I booked in for a demo and I got to
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:24.360]   spend about 10 minutes inside Daydream. And it's the best mobile VR experience I've had so far.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:32.520]   I've got cardboard. I've got, I've paid with the gear VR. I've even tried Oculus. It's not quite on
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.560]   that level, but nor would you expect it to be. But one thing that it does that none of the others
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:43.720]   do is fit over these glasses. Ah, yes, that's okay. That was my main question, Duncan. That sounded
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.200]   like heaven to us for us. You know these bits here? You put them on and they get jigged? Yeah.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:04:12.120]   Yeah. No, I bent in or they press against your temple or whatever the case may be.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:20.520]   The harsh reality of VR, Stacey. Not so would the time I spent now. They did have several very,
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:26.200]   very large air conditioning trucks. So perhaps the temperature was well controlled. But I didn't
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.400]   fog up in the 10 minutes in there using their new Daydream controller, which is a pivotal part of
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:37.160]   the standard and something that must be approved by Google before any third party hardware can be
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:44.280]   Daydream certified. It really made a big difference. I've, you know, using all of the other controllers,
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.480]   interacting with your face like this isn't good. Using a D-pad that doesn't allow you to point
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.520]   isn't good. Using a gamepad is all right. This thing was just intuitive. I mean, you just move
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:05:00.280]   your hand around and it shoots a beam out, you know, very simple button layouts. They certainly
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.560]   got the control interface right. More now, the latency was great. I do get a bit of motion sickness
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   with some VR games. I didn't with any of these. Now they weren't the type that twist and turn
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.120]   and throw you around with a multi-access spin. So that could very well be why. But it was really
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:23.000]   comfortable. It was really great. I got to try a tiltable game. You're racing against the computer
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.120]   and 3D dinosaur experience. I tried to boot up the Harry Potter one and he took the control off me.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:35.400]   No, I was going to ask you about that. That was kind of the marquee one that they really showed
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:41.640]   off to get everybody excited. It was there. It was installed. They would let you play with it.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:50.200]   They had a lot of people and small timelines. Oh, I see. It's second gen as how I would put it.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.960]   I think played with the first gen. It's definitely second gen mobile via.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:06:00.520]   Okay. I see what you mean. Not second gen as in cardboard was first gen. Is that what you mean?
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.360]   Okay. Well, that's a big step up, although it wouldn't take a whole lot to best cardboard.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:08.520]   But when we spoke to the VR team, though, they said, you know, the subtle hints, the fact it's
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.520]   got a head strap. That means that they're confident you can wear it without getting sick. You don't
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:19.080]   have to hold it up. You're not limited. I think it was 25 milliseconds now. The card, the previous
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:25.640]   was 110 milliseconds and they've got the frequency response down to 25. And it really shows. It was
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:31.400]   really good. I've always been interested/excited about VR, although I've never found a great use
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:41.480]   for it, apart from fun. But, you know, I'm happy. It was like it wasn't there because it really
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:46.120]   is a small amount of plastic, obviously, for the molding. One thing for you to see is the bit that
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:53.160]   does touch your face is replaceable, washable. So you can have your own. It just pulls out
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:58.840]   and another one drops in. So you don't need to worry. You can share one device and not have to
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.800]   worry too much about that. Oh, I love it. Okay. Because, yeah, like, how gross would it be to like
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:10.760]   see it? Like, you know, the brim of your hats? Right. Oh, my God. Try my VR viewer. This is a
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:18.040]   really cool game. No, don't do it. Don't do it. Yeah. I really like that the controller docks
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:25.080]   inside the visor. I think that was a super like thought that was touch. You know, I mean,
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.520]   it seems like a small thing, but I think it's actually a really, really big thing.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.960]   And other small things like having NFC inside the visor. So when the phone goes in,
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:40.440]   it automatically pairs with cardboard. You have to get it exactly lined up. This has two little
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:46.840]   touch pads that basically tell the phone within a reasonable error that, okay, here it and then it
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.800]   it zeroes the screen. So where you're looking is perfectly centered. You don't have to get that
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.960]   lined up just perfectly. Yeah, it's if they've done the little things, if they really want,
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:01.240]   you know, if the goal is to kind of take VR to the next level, you got to make it easy for the
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:05.720]   general consumer and having to like reposition it and slide it all around once you get it in the
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.920]   visor. No one enjoys that. And that just kind of being able to drop it in the way they showed
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.680]   it off. And I'm happy that it does that kind of smart alignment. So you can bring it.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:22.600]   Question time. That's why specialty. Will it work with all the other VR stuff I have?
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:29.800]   In what respect, Jeff? No, I mean, any other stuff that I've downloaded onto my Nexus phone that
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:38.440]   has worked in cardboard or whatever, there's no compatibility issue with with earlier VR stuff.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:42.680]   I wouldn't imagine so because they spoke about the catalog, but you know, they never mentioned
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.240]   that and I never thought to ask. Yeah, I never I didn't think about that aspect either. The fact
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:52.600]   that we have almost two years now of a cardboard ecosystem. I have to imagine because I mean,
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:09:00.440]   I feel like cardboard VR is like as like you said, it's a step down in dimension versus what you get
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.240]   here, which adds a whole layer of extra dimension with the control aspect. This is it would actually
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.000]   be simpler than that. Yeah, actually thinking about what to imagine so thinking about what
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.320]   they had a VR said is I don't think they will be compatible. There is a very rigorous
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:20.440]   compatibility process. If you submit an app for daydream certification, it is more than the
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:26.200]   standard Google Play Store approval process. It is actually tested for latency because their
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.000]   hardware is working. They've got the integrations there. The platform works fine. They don't want
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.600]   someone to code an experience for VR that just breaks all that. I mean, if I went home tonight,
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.400]   I figured add a code, put something together and checked it on the Play Store. It would be
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.000]   terrible. So this could be an issue. I mean, we don't know yet. We don't know this backward
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.640]   compatible. It's with if it downward compatible with other things. But that would be an issue.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.400]   If you're if you're a VR maker and you made some of these people in my business that have made a
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:56.920]   lot of VR news stuff, I hope for their sake that that it's usable. I just don't know yet.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:02.840]   They will have to resubmit it. They will. Wow. Or it's automatic, but yeah, it'll have to be
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.960]   it will have to be compatibility tested. That might be the New York Times. They were a partner
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:15.640]   in the VR stuff, right? I saw their list or their name up on the list, I swear, of VR daydream
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:21.320]   partner people. They definitely are. I just I wonder if that's because I mean, if what you're
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.440]   saying here, you know, yes, they had a cardboard app, but they are also a partner on daydream. So
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.520]   maybe they've done the work to make that happen. I would find it really strange if Google just
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.760]   said, all right, two years of cardboard stuff, sorry, you're going to have to start from scratch.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.960]   But I understand they really do want daydream to be a very tightly
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:43.320]   kind of honed in experience. It's very happily about controlling that experience. You know,
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.160]   not everything's going to get through only things that are good. Now, perhaps the New York Times
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.800]   had to do no work. Perhaps their app worked and was acceptable for daydream. So it may be
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:57.000]   K no difference. They're the things that will come out in the coming days, weeks, months. But
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.920]   yeah, it's not an instant that free dinosaur app that you downloaded that already made you sick
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:08.920]   on cardboard. I can almost guarantee that one won't be in daydream unless the developer really
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:16.840]   does something to it. Interesting. Or unless there's some sort of like cardboard wrapper app
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.960]   that allows you to run cardboard. I mean, I don't know.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.320]   >> Cardboard compiler.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.200]   >> Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. A view of roundabout way to do it.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.480]   I don't think Google would be too thrilled about that.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.720]   >> I saw my slide.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.960]   >> Did we miss anything from the event yesterday?
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.560]   >> Well, actually, we didn't talk about the Chromecast Ultra.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.200]   Does anyone have a 4K television set at home?
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:40.680]   >> No.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.160]   >> No.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:41.640]   >> No.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.320]   >> I can't afford it after buying the phone.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:51.480]   >> Do young people buy? I mean, I visited people who are like 22. They don't even have TVs
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.360]   in their apartments. They just watch everything in their laptops or tablet.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:54.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.720]   >> So I'm like, "Oh."
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.240]   >> I think at some point in time you age up into a television, but I could be wrong.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.240]   >> That's what they always said about newspapers. So when you get all over,
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:09.720]   you'll buy newspapers wrong. My father always said, "When you get all over, you'll vote Republican."
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.240]   Wrong.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:16.040]   So no, I'm not sure that you will age up into a TV.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:21.160]   But I don't know. I mean, my son does like having a big TV.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.840]   And he casts up to it. But he also watches a heck of a lot of stuff on his laptop.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:32.040]   >> Yeah. My daughter actually prefers her tablet versus an iPad as opposed to...
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.560]   >> It's a personal space.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.920]   >> I think that and it's a lot faster and easier because you've got to go...
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.160]   Maybe the set-top box rules will change all this, but for now, it's kind of like
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:47.720]   open the television. It checks for the internet access. Load the app.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.680]   The app loads.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.160]   >> Yes.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.280]   >> And then also presumably Stacey, you're actually going to watch a whole thing,
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.120]   where a whole thing might just be two minutes 30 now on YouTube.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.880]   And the pain of going into other stuff is just not worth it.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.200]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:00.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.320]   >> Is this the PC all over again? PCs aren't dead, but they've diminished.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.080]   TVs aren't dead. Are they diminishing?
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.240]   >> No, they're getting bigger.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.000]   >> Indeed.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.800]   As ownership numbers drop, I don't think they'll go away.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.680]   There are more options in the market than there were five, 10 years ago.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:24.840]   And so some people have replaced, some people have got both.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.960]   And so I just think it's a rebalancing and will that continue to shift?
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.200]   Yes.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.560]   Will VR replace someone's TV?
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.640]   You can sit there and get a full movie experience.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.200]   >> Right.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.000]   >> Like you're sitting in the theater.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.920]   >> That is like the loneliest thing I can imagine.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.200]   >> Not if it's a room full of people with VR on in the same movie theater virtually.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:42.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:49.000]   But Stacey, with Daydream, you can lay in bed and use the controller to move the screen wherever you want it to be.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.280]   >> This is not a selling point for me.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.080]   >> Place it on the ceiling.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:14:00.280]   >> Yeah, it seemed like, I mean, obviously with the Chromecast, I think that was kind of the
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:06.520]   lightest of the announcements, obviously. And that's just really, if Chromecast is a product
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:12.120]   for the living room space, we have to have one that supports the latest, you know, biggest technology.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.640]   So we'll double the price, throw an ethernet port on it, and there you go.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.320]   >> That was a good video.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.040]   >> Yeah, for sure. Having the ethernet port on there, I always kind of wanted to do that with
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.760]   my Chromecast. Apparently, they have a way that you can do that with normal Chromecast too.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.960]   So if that's the part of it that you liked, you can do that. There's an adapter for that, I suppose.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:41.640]   So that is that in a kind of as part of this, Google has removed the 5X and the 6P from the play
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:49.320]   store, as well as some other hardware. But basically, and Hiroshi Lockheimer and others have confirmed
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.200]   this, the Nexus brand, as it were, is now, you know, we can pour one out for Nexus because,
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.880]   apparently, they have no more plans for any Nexus devices going forward.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.440]   That's it. You can't even find them in the play store anymore.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.600]   >> I could create my own hardware product and call it Nexus and use the domain name.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.400]   >> Oh, yeah, no problem whatsoever. You don't have any problems.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.920]   >> No lawyers will give you no problem.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:19.960]   >> I don't know. Anyone super bummed about that kind of fact, especially because we've,
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.920]   I mean, at least some of us have obsessed over the Nexus brand for years.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:27.080]   >> I think the fanboy in me is sad to see an end of an era.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:27.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:34.760]   >> I think the equal opportunist in me was hoping that maybe the Nexus brand would continue.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.720]   We've got Android 1, we've got Pixel, and there's this big gap in between.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:43.240]   And we haven't really discussed the elephant in the room at the price of the phone, but,
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:51.080]   you know, deep down in my semi socialist heart, I was hoping that there would be a more accessible
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:56.040]   device that would come with guaranteed security updates, so that everyone on Android from Android
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:01.880]   1 to this mid-class to the top tier would have equal access to a safe and secure and updated
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:06.360]   operating system. But I knew that was a dream at the time because that's confusing branding.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.840]   >> Well, but not going to talk about that for a second. So if you're right, if you're Apple,
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.000]   you have basically two phones. You have one phone in different sizes. That's it.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.640]   Is that what Google's going to do? Or does Google with Android 1 and other things need to have
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.080]   a range of phones? If you, you know, Motorola was a range of different phones with different
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:28.520]   features with neat stuff like things that, you know, click on and all kinds of other things.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.800]   Is in the long run do we think that Google's going to need to have a range or is it Apple
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:40.680]   like going to have one official phone? >> So I posed that exact question to one of the VPs at the
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:46.440]   one-on-one session yesterday. I don't want to attribute to anyone in particular. But basically,
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:51.880]   when I asked the question, they said, there's already great hardware in the market, for example,
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:58.040]   the OnePlus 3. We do monthly security updates and make that available at the first of every
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:03.960]   month. And, you know, we work with our partners. >> They want to compete too much. They want to
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:08.440]   have a model and be Google, but they don't want to compete with Samsung and company too much.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:12.040]   >> I don't see it as competition. My question to them was actually, do you feel you have a
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:17.640]   moral imperative to ensure there is at least one safe and secure version of the phone for
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.720]   everyone at every price point? I even use the B2G, not the same. Pixel has become an exclusive
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:30.440]   device in the inclusive operating system, which is a bit of an oxymoron. I could choose to afford
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:35.400]   a Pixel. I don't know if I will, but many people can't. And there's many people with phones that
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.880]   are stranded on, I don't care about the dessert version as they called it. I care about the
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:45.720]   security updates. You know, if you're on 4.4, so what, as long as the phone is safe? >> Right.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:53.640]   >> Good, good point. >> That's an awesome point. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's what you lose.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:18:00.280]   >> Now I'm angry that there's not a cheap budget. >> Yeah. So, I mean, you mentioned
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:06.360]   Elphin in the room with the price. I will say that, you know, shortly after the event concluded
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:10.840]   yesterday, filtering through comments of the many articles that were written about it,
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:15.640]   I, you know, I posed a question on Twitter ahead of last night's all about Android to have people
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:20.360]   tell me what they thought of the announcement. And I mean, I don't know exactly how many, but I'd say
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:27.000]   the overwhelmingly majority opinion is that these phones are overpriced for what you get.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.960]   So when you're talking about Google's kind of ambitions of, you know, entering this with this
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.200]   world where their devices can stand toe to toe with some of the most premium devices out there,
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.720]   when there's this sensitivity to price point, I mean, did Google kind of do this to themselves
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   based on its own history? Or did it under deliver on features? Did it misread how important the
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:56.360]   consumer would, would consider things like the assistant AI and build quality and stuff?
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:03.000]   >> The time will tell is that the vocal minority or it, and will this phone sell just fine?
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.960]   You know, there's two, there's two ways to make money. You make a little bit of money a lot of
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:14.280]   time or you make a lot of money a little bit of time. You know, this just in 50.38% of
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.960]   asteroid readers will not be getting a pixel in any way, shape or form.
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:23.880]   >> Wow. I mean, I would imagine that number would be far, like, far less if it were a lower
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.680]   price, if it were a Nexus device, the way it has been for years.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.720]   >> All the comments are basically pricing. And last year, it was something like 80% saying they
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.680]   want one or would get one. But this is people just categorically saying no, we've never seen that
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.040]   kind of result. >> Wow.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.360]   Jason, if you weren't the god of Android, please don't call me that.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.200]   >> He's not? >> No.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:52.680]   >> Would you, would can Android then? Would you feel compelled to buy the pixel?
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:59.880]   >> It's a really great question. I mean, obviously, I get it because we do what we do,
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.280]   and we play with all these devices and it's, you know, it's part of what I do.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:10.040]   Would I be compelled, if I had the 6P going into this announcement, would I be compelled to
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.520]   pony up for that device? I don't think that I would.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:19.160]   >> I might cancel. I might cancel. I mean, I know I go through this neurosis every single time with
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:24.360]   every single device. Sorry, folks, it's what I do. So I ordered right away so I can make sure I had
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:29.480]   it in. But yeah, you know, so if I don't have it, how much am I going to grip my teeth?
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:35.080]   There'll be AI things I can't play with, which will bug me a lot. That's an issue. But again,
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:39.000]   I just sense that's not hard. We're dependent in any way. So we're getting
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.920]   gained on that. The camera, yeah, it'd be nice to have a much better camera, but you know,
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.000]   the 6P camera is a miracle itself. All of them are miracles are amazing.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:49.320]   >> Yeah.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:57.640]   >> I mean, I feel like the real big challenge that Google has to kind of overdo right now is
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:03.320]   the past and is history. And not to mention is the fact that right now we are in the middle of
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:09.800]   kind of like a new era of mid tier devices. This is the Huawei Honor 8 made entirely a glass front
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.560]   and back, of course, because of that, I dropped it and it's cracked, but they have a great replacement
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:19.080]   policy. I'm so bad with this. Don't you drop phones? Dude, it never used to be a thing. And now
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:23.400]   totally it is. I have the note seven here and I'm definitely afraid that I'm going to drop this
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:29.240]   thing and crack it. Anyways, my point being for $400, you can get a lot of phone nowadays.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.880]   And you're not you're not making the same sacrifices you used to make. You know, the OnePlus 3 has a
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.160]   Snapdragon 820 processor, which up until a month ago was cutting edge processor. So it's still great.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:44.040]   You know, six gigs of RAM, I believe on the OnePlus 3. That's a $400 phone designed well,
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.680]   like fit, finished, all that kind of stuff. Really great phone for half the price of what you're
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:54.680]   getting here. So the challenge that Google has is kind of erasing or at least convincing people
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.480]   that it's okay to spend double what they would spend. Yeah, you know, you're only emerged mid-tier
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:06.840]   device that's super strong. You're really right. The other issue is that is that Nougat is nice,
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:12.360]   but am I dying to have it versus Marshmallow? If I if I got a $400 phone that still have Marshmallow,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.640]   yeah, that's not so bad. And I think most of the $400 phones, if they are on Marshmallow,
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:23.640]   are going to have Nougat very soon. You know what I mean? They're all very current modern.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:29.400]   There's at least, you know, with Huawei and with OnePlus, like they still have an emphasis on
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:33.800]   making sure that they don't just release a device and then run away in the other direction, you know,
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.920]   and never updated whatsoever. It might not be as fast as Google, but their plan is to do that.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.840]   What $400? Maybe that's good enough.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.560]   Maybe what Google's done is actually create a vacuum. The problem with Samsung who make
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:51.320]   fantastic devices is they strand so many of their devices on older versions while they
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:56.520]   focus on their top tier ones, which means if you do get a mid-tier device, it probably won't
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.960]   get security updates and they're not quite as good. Enter the OnePlus One, enter things like the
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:09.240]   Axon 7. If they can deliver constant security updates, even if it's not monthly, even if it's
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:14.840]   three monthly. I mean, and they keep that raise of focus on just the one or two phones they're
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:20.200]   putting into market. That is an opportunity for someone to step up and go, hey, we're not Google,
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:24.440]   but this hardware is top tier. It's well-priced and we're going to keep it safe.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:32.120]   Yeah. You can fund me on Nexus at Kickstarter.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:37.320]   There's no denying that if I have the 6P it would be hard for me to
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.480]   convince myself that I had to have this phone, that there was no brainer in it.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:46.120]   Oh, now you're making me so you wouldn't order it. Stacey, you're not ordering it.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.840]   Are you in the Twit problem that you have to have it?
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:24:00.920]   I'm still waiting. In Australia, the phone I want would be $1470. That is a lot of money,
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.920]   even in our Australian money, which, by the way, makes more sense because it's different
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:14.520]   size and different colors, just saying. How do I justify that purchase?
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:21.240]   Do I justify it with a Pixel launcher that lets me do a couple of unique things with
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.720]   Google Photos, Storage, Open Resolution and Quality? I'll probably never access.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.760]   The support is cool.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:33.480]   24/7 support. We didn't mention that. Gesture controls on the fingerprint sensor. There's
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.760]   little things. There are things. There is one thing that the Google hardware team said yesterday in
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:45.960]   the one on ones. That's that this 24/7 support goes beyond just that screen in the Settings app.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:51.000]   They are building in every launch market, at least the original launch markets,
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.040]   a logistics replacement network. At the moment in Australia, if you break a Google phone,
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.120]   you get on the phone to Google and you put it in a box or do whatever, they're talking about
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:08.120]   walk-in opportunities. They didn't say where those partners were, but think Samsung's store more
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:14.040]   than a Google store, but the ability to actually get their getting logistic networks of all the
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:19.560]   spare parts into those countries. Partners to actually do warranty repairs locally in that country.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:25.720]   That is a big deal. That is another thing that they're bringing to these markets.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:30.520]   I questioned them on the financing deals. 100% it's coming to other markets.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.560]   Just not any time soon. But maybe next year, maybe the year after that.
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:42.600]   This isn't just a phone for Google. This is a massive ecosystem play. I think maybe those buying
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:49.000]   a Pixel this year are funding it. Like a Kickstarter. It feels like a deal.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.560]   You kickstart in Google because they're broke. Oh yeah, Google is hurting right now.
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.440]   Needs your money and your support. It's all in Ireland.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:03.800]   But possibly true. At least to a certain degree. Any final thoughts on this before we thank the
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.200]   final sponsor and get into our picks and stuff? Because apparently this episode is nothing but
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.360]   yesterday's event. But I think I'm okay with that. If you guys are. Yeah, I think so too.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:19.160]   Lots of fun though. I had a lot of fun spending the last 48 hours talking about
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:24.840]   Google's event. I'm glad it's over now. Now over the course of the weekend,
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.200]   the fog will lift a little bit and I'll realize how I really feel.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:34.600]   But before we get into our tips and tricks and all that stuff, let's take a minute to thank Rocket

[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.080]   Or if you haven't, you don't know what you're in store for. It's a lot of finding information,
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.640]   a lot of pulling information from different places to give them what they need in order to get that
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.880]   mortgage. And what is the end game? Getting into that house, you know, and that makes it so worth

[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:27.880]   Quick and Loans for their support. All right. Let's see here. What do we have? Let's scroll down
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.240]   to the very bottom here and see. We do have a number down there. So, Jeff, I'll start with you.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:39.800]   What's your number? Oh, no. All right. So, I have to struggle for this when I admit. But let me try
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:46.440]   to be counterintuitive, not for the first time. So, Pew survey says that 61% of millennials get
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.040]   their political news on Facebook and trigger the, "Oh my God, they're all ignorant. This is horrible
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.800]   in the echo chamber." But, you know, compared to some percentage percentage getting their political
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:05.080]   news on TV, I'm not so sure this is so bad. You know, I get it on Facebook. No two people on the
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.160]   world see Facebook. It depends on how smart or stupid your friends are as to what you see. But,
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.920]   I think that that is not necessarily a bad sign for the democracy. Now, they also said that four
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:20.440]   in 10, quote, consistent liberals say they have blocked or unfriended someone over political
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:27.080]   disagreements. Well, in this current race, I wouldn't say that's terribly surprising either.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:33.480]   So, I constantly hear this argument about how the internet is an echo chamber and all you are
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:41.640]   over here is what satisfies your informational cravings. Well, yeah, okay. But the fact that you
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:46.200]   see arguments all over means that you know there is another side. If you have stupid friends,
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.880]   you probably see stupid stuff. If you have smart friends, you probably see smart stuff. And if you
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:55.000]   have stupid friends, you probably weren't going to be interested in any way. So, I just wanted to
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.440]   put in a word for saying that I think what we have to do in my world and media is make more
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:05.400]   things that are compatible with conversations so that people will pass it around and that has
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:11.320]   facts and has actual smart arguments inside those memes. And that is possible.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:17.320]   So, here, here, I was at an event last night. Nick Denton, founder of the Gawker, of course,
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:23.640]   was interviewed by Kevin Delaney, the editor-in-chief of courts. Nick is a long, long old friend from
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:30.680]   ages back. And Delaney said to Denton something about how will you still believe, even after all
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.120]   this, you still believe the internet is going to improve things. And Nick said, yeah, and Kevin
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.480]   turned to the room and said, well, who else believes the internet is still going to improve
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:44.360]   things? Only Jay Rosen of NYU and I raised our hands. So, I think there's a lot of pessimism
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.800]   going around, especially given the current climate, current political view.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:53.960]   And I think we in media have messed things up and we haven't shown enough empathy to people and we're
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:31:01.320]   not understanding different communities' needs. But nonetheless, nonetheless, I'm still an optimist.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:08.200]   Excellent. I like to think I'm an optimist too. I mean, six out of 10 millennials getting their
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:13.720]   political news on Facebook, at least, I don't know, maybe it's irresponsible to say, but at least
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:19.320]   they're getting it from somewhere, or at least they're trying to, you know, at least there's
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.560]   intention and there's there's a tension. And there are worse sources, Lord knows. Sure, there are.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:28.120]   At least there's intention. And this is this is one of those political well, any political
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:33.880]   season, it's important for there to be intention and for people to feel like they have somewhat of
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:39.160]   an educated voice that's a little bit more than than just, I don't know, that guy or that girl,
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:44.360]   whatever the case may be. So if that helps them get more educated and have a firm understanding
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:50.680]   of their belief, then I'm up for it. Sure, why not? Let's see here. Stacey, what about you? You
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:59.480]   got a recipe today or anything like that? Oh, can't hear you. Oh, there we go. Oh, I'm back.
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:05.720]   Yeah. Okay. I have, I have a recipe if you want it. I'm not, I'm not really keen on this recipe.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:12.840]   I'll be honest. So I'd rather, I'd rather tell you something else because I am keen on it. So tell
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:17.000]   us something else. Tell us what you're keen on. Okay, let me tell you what I'm keen on. So I've
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.520]   been working with, um, Duolingo, which is the, I'm sure you guys all know this. This is a language
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:26.440]   learning app that is free. And if you don't know about it, you should just, if you want to learn a
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:30.760]   language, you should play because it's super fun and awesome. But they launched something called
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:36.840]   Tiny Cards. It's only for iOS right now, but they're basically flashcards to learn all kinds of
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:44.040]   crazy stuff. And I downloaded it on the iPad. And my daughter's using it to learn Chinese characters.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:53.800]   She takes Mandarin and they're fun. It's got the same sort of fun, easygoing stuff. I, it's free. So
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.840]   I wish that we're on Android. I know that this is a, this week in Google show. So I'm really sorry.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:06.760]   No, but, but it's great. I mean, I don't know how, how else to say it. I've been enjoying
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:11.560]   Duolingo at now. I, we downloaded this and we've been having a great time. So if you like to learn
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:17.000]   things or like games that like you, you're sick of wasting your time playing like, I don't know,
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.200]   what do people play now? Candy Crush? That was sold. Whatever you play now.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:27.960]   The Pokemon, the Pokemon's ongoing and stuff. Yeah, the Pokemon's ongoing. So if that gets older,
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.720]   whatnot, you know, check this out because I, I always think it's fun to learn stuff.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:36.360]   Nice. Excellent. And someday I imagine they'll bring it to Android.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.720]   And next week when I'm whole, oh, I'm not going to be home. I really want to show you guys a lightbulb
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:48.040]   in the flesh, but not going to be home for the lightbulb for a long time. So I'm really sad
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:53.240]   about this. Maybe I'll show you, I'll do a video because because y'all are going to love this lightbulb.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:58.440]   Lightbulb in the glass. Yeah, wait. Yes. Most exciting thing ever.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:03.560]   Thank you, Stacey. So Duncan, I realized we pulled you into the show last minute.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.640]   Thank you for doing this, Duncan. Yeah. Thank you, by the way. Fantastic.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:13.080]   It's good sport material for sure, for sure. You got a thing? I do. So I had a quick look
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:21.560]   through my phone for my most used, most useful tools. And I ship devices all around the country,
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.000]   have packages coming and going personal and both for Olu's droid. And I've always had troubles
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.200]   keeping track of them. You know, I'll have an app here, but then I won't have that device. And so
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:40.840]   I went searching and what I found was deliveries, which is a multi device, Android only for now,
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:50.520]   package tracking app that. The camera set up, it's, it might be, I don't know if we're in.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.800]   Oh, we have. Oh, okay. Now. And yes, and almost. There we go.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.560]   Just like a little bit of surgery. I know. It's a little weird. It's like backwards.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:05.000]   It's been a while since I've held a camera. So what it allows you to do is just to add in
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.680]   a delivery from most shippers. It's got most shippers around the world. So when I'm bringing
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.480]   things in from the States, from China, from England, from anywhere in Australia, just let you add
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:19.640]   them. But then this syncs up to the cloud. So you can get it just on a web interface,
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.520]   or you can get it across all your devices. And one of the things that I really love is you can
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:29.640]   actually just go in touch and it'll take you to a map. And so you can see exactly where it is,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.640]   where it's gone. And so you can, you know, a lot of apps have this, but right is chat.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:41.320]   And I just find that's one of my most useful tools. So it's deliveries on the Google Play
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:45.160]   Store to get all of the features and customizations. It was a couple of dollars, but,
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:52.120]   you know, save yourself from drinking one of your horrible American coffees and give the money to
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.000]   an app developer. In fact, save yourself from drinking any coffee. I don't know if I can do that.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.640]   I found a couple of good ones. Big shout out to Blue Bottle in San Francisco.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:05.880]   That was pretty good. And the turnaround, I think it was, which was just near there.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:11.160]   It's just near where the trolley turns around. This is from a man from a country where they
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:16.360]   basically petroleum jelly that's like from the oil well black goo on things.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:23.160]   I was this close to bringing Jason some veggie mite, but yes, Daniel has brought me Vegemite in
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:29.560]   the past. He's also brought me Cadbury chocolates filled with Vegemite. They were horrible. They
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:34.120]   were even Australians didn't like it. They were not good. I think when I saw it, I was like,
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:39.720]   okay, maybe I guess. But then when I tried it, it was like, no, I think that's just a trolley
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:44.840]   in tourists. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. That was my indication that he doesn't like me very much.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.360]   You could give them out at Halloween to small children. And they would
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:56.760]   that's what you do. That's what you do. Stacy, you have a devil streak in you. I love it.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.840]   I'm a terrible person. That's a great idea. Last year in Halloween, when we were done
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.840]   trick or treating, well, when we wanted to go out trick or treating, we left the rest of our
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.880]   candy out on the front doorstep. And then later, actually, one of our sponsors is Ring,
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:16.120]   full disclosure. But I later realized that some kids had come along and dumped the whole thing of
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:21.960]   candy in their bag and ran off. And of course, I had video of it. So maybe next time, what I'll do
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.920]   is I'll put those Cadbury's in there. They'll steal it and I will have the last laugh.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.880]   The bad news is it was a chocolate so horrible. It's my longer available.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.160]   Oh, I should have kept it. It would be a collect.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:39.400]   Collect is on. My tip is really quick. It could have been done on this show already before,
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:43.080]   but it's something that I've been using a lot lately just because it's so darn handy.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:48.920]   And it's in Google Drive. It's in the Drive app. If you didn't know already, you can scan documents
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:53.160]   with Google Drive for Android. And I know, you know, sometimes when I see that, when I first saw
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.600]   this, I was like, what's the difference between scanning a document and taking a picture of
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.440]   something? They're kind of the same, but a little bit different. So I'll go ahead and tap the plus,
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:06.520]   tap scan. It'll give me once I give a permission, it'll give me my camera overlay. So let's say
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.400]   this is a business card. It's actually a frequent Zazler's reward card for a restaurant.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:15.640]   But see how it's all angled and everything? I'll go ahead and take a picture of that.
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:21.640]   And boom, it automatically crops it. It scans it to a PDF. You've got different color options.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.040]   If you want it to just be black and white, you could do that. You could do color drawing,
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:29.560]   which is going to make it look a little bit more realistic if I can get that to go.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:34.840]   But anyway, scan it into a Google Sheets. That would be amazing for business cards.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.560]   Let's see here. Yeah. I don't know if it goes to contacts either one.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:45.480]   So I'll go ahead and save it. There it is. Basically, it scans into a PDF and is stored on your
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.880]   drive account, which, yeah, those other features would be nice too. But there you go.
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:53.800]   I would pay for those other features. All right, come on, Google. Do something useful.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.120]   We've given them some ideas. Yeah, make something useful. Why don't you Google?
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:01.480]   Yeah. She's for a change. Another PDF is a key.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.760]   A full knowledge. These OCR.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:09.720]   That's nerdy. Bring that PDF in to keep use OCR. And there you go.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:15.400]   I wonder how well that would work. That's it for this week in Google. Duncan,
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:20.520]   Jeffery, our last minute guest from Osteroid Senior Associate at osteroid.net.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.360]   Thanks for joining us today. Really appreciate it.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.480]   Nice. Thank you for having me on. I came to watch the show and got to be part of it.
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:28.280]   So that's pretty awesome. I'll walk over to you. You're a great Duncan.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.760]   I'm like, so you got nothing for it. Not even candy. You love candy.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.760]   I'll give you a Tim Tam if you want one. We've got Tim Tam's in it.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:39.800]   Okay. All right. Well, we might have, we have a bowl of candy out there. Maybe there's something
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.560]   in there that's unique. Send him some blue bottle.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:48.200]   Maybe do they do an internet send sort of thing? Because I'm not a blue bottle right now.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:54.920]   I'm very displeased that blue apron isn't an Australian. In fact, to all to its sponsors.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:01.480]   All of you, please move to Australia. I want to Casper Mattress. I would like a ring video doorbell
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:05.720]   easy to get without postage. It's got to be a challenge living in Australia for that very
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.560]   reason. Not just, not just in what you're talking about right now, but also just, I mean, products
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.800]   in general, like Google products, they do their releases. They don't necessarily release to
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:18.680]   everywhere. There's lots of buying and shipping and reshipping and then having issues and reshipping
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.800]   back and warranties. But hey, you do it because you love it. That's right. That's right. Where can
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:29.240]   people follow your work online? I think the best place to find me is on Oz Droid. So that's
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:34.040]   Oz Droid.net. You'll find all of my writing there as well as all the rest of the team.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:40.680]   We did a lot of coverage at Google's event. I've got just a few more videos to edit and put up,
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.400]   as well as a few more hands-on impressions of some of the other bits and pieces.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:50.280]   But yeah, you can follow us there for the Australian perspective on all of the
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.160]   Android and the connected technology news. Excellent. Duncan, thank you again.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:59.640]   Thank you. Appreciate it. Stacey, we didn't know if you were going to make it, but you flew in last
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:04.840]   minute. You didn't play any drums, which I'm a little sad about that, but we'll forgive you.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:09.240]   I can't believe my piano counted for nothing. No, your piano was pretty awesome.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:14.760]   But we didn't hear any sort of like tense music to build up on certain topics. I don't know.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:19.240]   I guess I expected a little more of your piano playing. I don't actually play the piano.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:25.240]   So I thought it was really good. Someone said, "I know, I'm never one of a mad."
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.080]   Stacey, where do you want people to find all the stuff you're doing right now?
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:34.920]   Oh my gosh. You can see me at @gagaStacey on Twitter. You can find me at the IOT...
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:41.800]   Sorry, www.iotpodcast.com. And I have a column on PCMag where this week, actually,
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.440]   I just did a thing on security. So how to make your smart home secure. And that column is called
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:53.960]   Get Smart with Stacey. Excellent. Check it out. Thanks again, Stacey. It was a lot of fun doing a
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.400]   couple of these shows with you on coverage yesterday. I really appreciate it. I'm going to
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:03.080]   miss you, Jason. I'm going to miss you. Until the next time Leo departs, and then I'll be here again.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.880]   And I'm sorry about that. Pick him out. Face the locks. Jeff, what about you? Always a pleasure
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:12.920]   doing a show with you. I don't know. Buzzmachine.com. Are there other places to point people to?
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.840]   Oh, no. I'm boring. That's it. You're boring? I don't think that you're boring.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.000]   Oh, you're just sort of a bad word. There is a bad word on that.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.640]   Ow. With the whole episode without a bad word. That's okay. Buzzmachine.com.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:31.080]   And, you know, find them on Twitter, of course, all over the map. You can find me at
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:38.200]   about.me/JasonHowell also all over the network doing tech news today, doing all about Android,
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:43.000]   Android, Apparina. And tomorrow I'm going to Oculus Connect. So I'll be doing a Twitch special
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.240]   there. I'm going to go check out a bunch of VR stuff. Really looking forward to that. It's
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:51.080]   going to be a lot of fun. That coverage is going to be at twit.tv/specials.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:54.920]   But that's it for this week. Really appreciate you joining us for this
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:59.640]   week in Google. Of course, Leo Leport will be back next week with the both of you. So it'll be back
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:06.440]   to the normal regularly scheduled program recording live every Wednesday, 4pm Eastern, 1pm Pacific,
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:16.360]   20pm UTC, 2000. Is that what he normally says? I don't know what it is. 200 UTC. And you can
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:22.040]   find, of course, all the information on this show at twit.tv/twig. That is it for this week.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:32.280]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google. Bye everybody.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.120]   (uplifting music)
