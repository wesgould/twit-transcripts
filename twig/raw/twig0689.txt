[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.760]   Hi Glenn. Oh there. Thanks for having me back. Uh, Jeff Jarvis is here. He is
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.560]   The Leonard Tom professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.960]   Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.480]   At the City University of New York. He is the very model of a modern journalist professor
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.120]   Uh, hello Jeff. Hello boss. Did you up were you up late last night? No, no, I did not watch anything last night
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.080]   You were smart to yeah, I've had it on mute most of the day today. I missed you didn't miss anything
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.880]   I didn't miss anything. I didn't miss damn thing. I've been happily unmastered on thanks to you
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   Oh, we're all masted on East is here including Aunt Pruitt from hands-on photography. Hello aunt
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.560]   Hello, sir. Let me ask you all three of you. Are you Twitter refugees or is it Twitter plus?
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.400]   Mastodon Glenn you're on both right Twitter. Yeah, Twitter Twitter plus but holy cow things picked up so quickly
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.920]   I'm think I'm gonna be Twitter minus soon. I mean I don't plan to leave
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.840]   Twitter's been very useful and for me in a lot of ways professionally. I made a lot of friends there in the olden days the sort of
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.400]   pre 2015 days
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.240]   But a lot of the people who I spend the most time reading and talking with
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.920]   Have already moved to mastodon and they're active over there and I'm like well
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.880]   Maybe the parties move to you know parties move to elephant's house. Maybe that's where we'll we'll wind up converging Jeff. You're both right
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.400]   Oh, definitely both, but I I'm finding I was spending more time on mastodon
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.600]   And uh, you know I wrote a post about it which I blew my cut to and and I made a point on twitter of saying that you taught me everything
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.400]   I know about mastodon my expertise of five days is all from you. I thought every I thought reach Phil been everything he knows about twitter and
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.880]   So it just comes around and aunt you're doing both or no
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.480]   Um sort of in the ling limbo right now with with twitter. I haven't been on it about a day and a half. Yeah
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.640]   Um, I saw that
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.200]   Nazi looking thing and it sort of rode me the wrong way
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.360]   Yeah, I'm from the leadership and yeah, I don't know my communities there
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.680]   Um, I that's the hard thing isn't it leaving them behind I've grown my brand through twitter and linked then and
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.000]   I've enjoyed my community there
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.960]   But at the same time some of the stuff that I saw from the leadership that that it rode me the wrong way
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   So it's my account is still there
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.480]   Um
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.880]   But I can't say that I've actively checked anything in the last day and I have it's really interesting
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.800]   We we have had and my lower third has said my mastodon handle for three years twit social
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.000]   Which probably a lot of people look at it and go what's twit.social/atlea what is that?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.280]   And no no idea what that is uh, I know now
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   Well, that's what's interesting now you're seeing every bbc time magazine interviewed the creator
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.040]   Mastodon's all over the place as if and this is where I think there's a little bit of a mistake
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.720]   that
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.120]   You're going to take twitter just like you did with my space and replaced it with facebook
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.320]   You're going to take twitter and just replace it with mastodon
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.240]   And I think a lot of twitter users will be very disappointed when they get to mastodon
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.880]   It's been a the last three years has been very quiet
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.320]   And mastodon it's been a very cozy little corner of the world. It's been like a
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.120]   Cafe where no one really it goes but the people were sitting there know each other
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.560]   They love it. They love the quietness of it and it has changed
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.480]   100 over the last five days because
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.280]   more than I think it's now two million people have
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.520]   Exited twitter and gone or at least quite a massive
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.200]   Um, and I don't know how many have exited twitter. I exit twitter. I can't I've exited it before but I just
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.920]   I was up to add it up to here. Well
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   You know when I got three jokes about
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.360]   masturbating in a row over my morning coffee from mr. Musk the owner
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.680]   I said, you know, this is not the place I want to be on Nazi stuff even worse. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I had every advertiser
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.360]   Yeah, all the advertisers are gone and he says oh, yeah, this is your activist or no, elan
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.600]   That's no quite work that way, but anyway
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.880]   Uh, so lea yesterday I had a class, uh, mareth park who's one of the leading experts in black twitter
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.240]   She has a book coming out next year about it oxford university press she's brilliant
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.440]   And I asked the question. I said is there gonna be a black mastodon
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.360]   And what she said I hope she won't mind me repeating this. I don't think she will
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.640]   She said it doesn't offer all the affordances that were necessary to create black twitter
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.400]   The ability to to have a place where you could get to anybody
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.040]   And and and and she would say it better than I could
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.960]   Um, and I saw mary reber at ole who's a an amazing academic medieval academic
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.440]   Um, uh
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.720]   I forget her her twitter handle. She tweeted about this and said, you know, I yeah, I have an account over there
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.080]   I got to go bag
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.800]   but um, um, um, you know what I'm seeing is a white exodus
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.840]   And you know, you're gonna leave us alone here
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.920]   Um, and I remember on re brock jr. Who wrote a distributed blackness. So I've quoted offered on the show
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.040]   Uh, I haven't talked to him about this in the last few weeks, but but you know, he said when one must started
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.760]   Um, circling this wagon
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.360]   He said you're gonna have to really kick us off here because we built something here
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.920]   So I think that there's a lot of communities like that
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.840]   That are going to be very reluctant to have to pick up and move
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.360]   Somewhere else that are going to fight for where they are. So I don't want to leave twitter because I want to be there for that
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.960]   I don't want to be there around that and twitter is the weaker for not having them
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.160]   I mean must have done as much the weaker for not having a black man
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.120]   That's not asked on has plenty of black users. There is a black mastodon
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.360]   What you're here with all the same kind of what you're gonna hear over over again is twitter apologists
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.800]   On twitter saying oh yeah that mastodon is bs. That's no good. You don't want that. There's nothing good there
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.320]   Meanwhile, there are plenty of people of color on mastodon. Yeah. Yeah, there is plenty of
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.880]   Quote black mastodon
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.320]   But it's twitter people who are justifying staying on twitter
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.680]   That's fine. You can stay in the burning house. Everything is fine. No problem thing
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.880]   Uh, and I think communities of interest form already. There's a mastodon for journalists of all people
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.120]   Well, let's talk about that. Let's talk about that. So so adam davinson x
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.440]   Mpr new york times new yorker who's now up in vermont
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.720]   Uh, he said to me well gee, maybe we should start a server and I kind of said you know you go on stage
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.760]   Um and adam did it all on his own and started journey. I don't host jau rna.host
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.200]   And I just agreed to use some money from the center. I run to give him six months
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.200]   Uh headway here and he has a small tech team helping him already
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.000]   He needs tech help if anybody else wants to help their all volunteer
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.040]   Uh because it's it's verifying the journalists
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.760]   Who were there which is a very tricky question. No and again
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.280]   That is a twitter mindset that is wrong
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.240]   Because that's not how verification works on mastodon. So well wait wait wait
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.520]   Bs that's a centralized blue chair. Yeah, you're doing that you're doing the old
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.200]   I'm gonna show you how you verify yourself unmasted. I know I lio. I'm telling you something different now
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.120]   Listen, I know I know how yes, you were waiting for a centralized blue check is
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.480]   No, wait, wait. Wait. Give me a second here dan han put up a great post a week ago
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.640]   Saying that what he hoped would happen is that the washington post would create its own server again
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.600]   And and I know I know there's the other method to do it
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.360]   But we need institutions if if 230 goes down
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.480]   We need institutions to stand behind these servers
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.320]   Uh, you know, it's got sure worries you there's a liability here
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   And we need places that have lawyers to worry about some of this stuff
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.040]   I think a lot of that stuff goes away when you decentralized. I think it's easy to shut down
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.600]   Uh twitter is virtually impossible to shut down the fediverse
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.360]   But it's not impossible to come sue you and make your life miserable
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.000]   So I move it off with with takedowns and well, maybe so go but go ahead and show people how to
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.040]   I can move it on short. So the first thing I show you is
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.560]   Yeah, you probably already know this but you go you go to your
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.200]   I'm using the advanced mastodon in your face. So this might look a little different from yours
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.000]   You can turn that on hash tag nicer with light mode
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.280]   Hash you can make it light if you want hashtag black. I'm gonna hit return
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:21.560]   And this is gonna give me some hashtags with a word black including black mastodon. I click on it now. I have a column
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.720]   That has the of post with black mastodon. That's you're gonna be your starting point
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.320]   I'm gonna pin that
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.560]   And I'm gonna move that over
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.160]   So it's a little higher
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   It's better than you appear
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.000]   And now I have this column. This is much like tweet deck of black mastodons
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.760]   Oh, I'll hide that interface now
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.400]   I wouldn't necessarily say you're gonna keep this forever
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.200]   But what you're gonna do is you're gonna see who's posting here
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.600]   You're gonna see what some of the other tags are
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.200]   And let's see. I'll pursue black joy. I like that. I'm gonna follow him
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.720]   It's not gonna take you long effects gonna take you less time here
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.360]   Then it would have taken you on twitter. I'm not saying really
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.120]   I'm not saying there aren't black people on mastodon
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   I'm saying that there was a culture that was built up on twitter that is not easily transported
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.240]   And I don't think we should dismiss it just because it came on twitter
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.000]   I don't see why it's not easily transported, but I'm not gonna speak to that
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.240]   I think that the jurna dot host actually
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.080]   Transported them over but I think they also are still thinking in that
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.040]   It's unfortunate because twitter brain is a little bit of a messed up mind
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.760]   So if you go to your jeff jarvis
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.920]   Here, right
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.080]   This is this is your profile
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:32.920]   Which I did I didn't put the stuff on my you have a verified these so what you need to do is verify these you sell verify
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.000]   By adding a
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.760]   Industry not industry web standard
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.760]   rel.me tag
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.720]   rel.me
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.360]   To your buzz machine blog to your medium post is easy to do you can even do it on twitter
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.760]   You certainly can do it at cuny
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.120]   You will then convert these into verified let me show you my um
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.640]   Profile so you can see what it looks like once it's verified. So this is my blog. So it's green check
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.760]   So what this tells you is that I control
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.040]   This blog enough to add this
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.920]   Account to it self verification and this is actually a better system than the twitter blue check
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:13.720]   But I think community verification say I would love community verification because mastodon is all about the instances right?
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:19.800]   It's all about the servers that form the federation and at some level you can ignore that if your interest is in having a global
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.720]   Presence you don't actually need to worry about the instance except that way you get both
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.200]   I mean that instance is great. You just sign up for this that you've if there were a long instance
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.640]   I would say you go there
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.920]   Yeah, although there's I mean we can get into this as an issue with you're gonna only have one identity that people can follow
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.480]   They're not sure if you want know if you want to have many identities they have to follow each of them from each instance
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.000]   Well, you can decide federated identity right you decide what you want
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.880]   But you could have four identities with four different persona
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.560]   But then I but then at a global level I have to pick I have to pick one of those so I'm right
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.440]   I'm actually at twitter social. Thank you for running it
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.640]   I signed up in april because I was like hey leo's on this. Let's see what it's about
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.280]   So that's where I'm that's where I'm at now
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.360]   But if I want to be on four instances
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.960]   I mean I think it gets into like how much is this like discord or slack versus twitter or facebook
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.000]   It's more like i would say it's more like discord in that regard except it's one right each but there's a federation
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:17.240]   Right each instance is like a channel. So at some point I won't be surprised if someone creates a concept of federated i d's
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.040]   So you register on one instance and you can link these so i d's you have another instances and then the
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.160]   Instances in a way you could you could do that with a verification as well. You could have in any profile
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:33.480]   uh verified extra profiles right but you want I think it's the idea is like how this is part of the evolution is
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:41.320]   How much does how much is this its own beast which it is right now that resembles in some way other microblogging services like twitter
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.440]   Um, but the verification thing this is what I want to support jeff on this because I think it's one thing if you said
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.920]   Oh, we're gonna have a central authority run it mastodon dot social that is gonna verify people
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.480]   I don't think I don't want that i don't want anybody wants it
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.960]   But and I love self verification because i'm used to that from a keybase.io for instance
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.600]   Right you can have your key base years. Yeah, i'm using key oxide, which is a successor to keybase
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:09.800]   But this is great, but but I think there is I think there's a place because it's federated for having a federated authority
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.320]   Where you choose what authority you accept and if somebody wants to figure out
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.080]   You know, I know a lot of reporters and this happened to me too when I was verified
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.880]   There's no value to me for being verified except when I DM somebody they're like, uh-huh
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.960]   There's a mark of approval that means that somebody took a look at this guy
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.200]   So if I were verified on if I didn't let's say I registered journal journal
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:35.320]   host and uh, I get verified by them on that one instance in some particular way
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.800]   If I reach out to a source, they have a way of saying this group and I can choose whether to accept their authority or not
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.400]   Has done some outside work
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.960]   You know, it's kind of like an ssl or tls certificate
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.520]   If you go someplace and there's a green check mark or or whatever the symbol is on your browser
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.120]   That shows that a site is secure and it's got a certain level of validation
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.640]   You're making the assumption that some outside party has done this closed loop, but it's totally distributed
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.400]   There's all these certificate authorities. There's millions and millions billions of websites
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.600]   There's no centralized authority that says hey, we're the only people who can validate a website
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.760]   Uh by the same token. I want every instance to have its ability to validate users
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:19.880]   If they choose and different standards because that's again. That's a you have that I should you have uh, you have industry or organizations
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.760]   You could say, uh, mcs e or right?
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.480]   Uh, and I'm talking to one of those organizations right now to take over what adam is doing
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.320]   We just get him going and then you know, um
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.760]   Yeah, I'm gonna make up an organization the american journalism union and how would you show how would you show that?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.920]   I mean it could be a link on the website the name of their instance. That's all
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.480]   Yeah, I mean, how would I how would I?
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.120]   Verify jeff that you are a member of the there's someone there
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.560]   Well, there's someone there who's gonna verify adam is doing that right now adam saying that's how that's any way
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.040]   Show us three articles. I don't yeah, that's so stupid
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.760]   All you have to do is link to buzz machine and then you have verified that this is
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   Don't know who the positive
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:09.720]   Yeah, yeah, this is an organization that's all right or opposed to you were a real people
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.400]   Pig slime they you can come in and be pig slime you can create the the denvergiz guardian
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   You know c 2016 and you can say look I've got a publication
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:25.160]   I'm a journalist and I I verified linking to the denver guardian. That's worthless. It's worse than worthless
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.040]   It it it it brings down the credibility of everything no adam comes along
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.920]   Tell me how you tell adam that you're a journalist used to give them three tear sheets, right?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.720]   This is how you would tell mastodon you would link back to those three things and then have those three things verify you are who you say you are
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.000]   That's a little bit superior than you sending adam three tear sheets
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.120]   And then adam does something that somebody else has to trust adam to trust you you're nuts
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.600]   But you guys have to you guys have centralized brain and you're gonna i'm just gonna say this
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.120]   Let it go because i'm not
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.520]   Is i believe i believe in the power of industry standard you want no no no no
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.800]   I want every instance to be able to set its own terms for this and so i don't
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.440]   Stop that you can do that
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.120]   But just because somebody we're doing somebody that's gonna do it because no we're not
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.200]   Because you're a host doesn't tell me that you're an official you can judge it as you wish you can judge it as you wish
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.760]   That's the point of federation you can ignore it
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   Well, it's good for you it's a sub- depotory
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.400]   There is a real verification system. That's not if you guys want to do that
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.080]   I certainly think it's fine
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.880]   I think you're mistaken in thinking that the system that exists isn't more than adequate
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.680]   It really is oh i i 100 percent discretely the system that exists is a technical thing
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.920]   It only works for a subset of people have access to the head tags on their page and
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.800]   Well, you don't belong to that you don't belong to that place then if you can't have a railed up me there
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.120]   No, I don't think that's necessary
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.560]   That leaves out 79.9 percent of people
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.000]   Well, i'll say this
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.760]   That's that's you being too geeky Leo. That's you assisting on a geek hierarchy
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.920]   Well, I hear the one jeff lisa. She has queen pruit calm
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:10.360]   But I can guarantee you she has no idea how to put in the real tag
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.800]   Right. Well, i'll show you because it's actually pretty easy
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.520]   They even tell you what when you want to verify a mastodon you click a link for you and i
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.480]   No, no women you click a link and they say see this copy this
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.240]   Paste it into your website. You're done. Yeah, but you have to exit for the head tags too
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.160]   It does not mean i'd have any of this
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.760]   But I saw somebody who tried five times there people are confused
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.400]   You're doing you're doing
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   Geek snobbery here. Yeah, don't mean now it is a nogus a tember
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.120]   Welcome to the modern world. That's all you know
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.880]   Let me ask you aunt. Do you feel like there is a culture on a mastodon that's welcoming
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.200]   Uh to people. Oh, yeah
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:55.320]   Yeah, definitely do um, but the the bigger story that i'm that i'm seeing with this
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.080]   It reminds me of all of the the family and friends
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.200]   Quote-unquote friends that are on the facebook platform
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.560]   Just because there are some good people on that facebook platform
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.920]   That can't quite seem to leave that and go to twitter because it just there's a disconnect
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.640]   Between twitter and facebook far is too concerned. They just don't quite get it
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.040]   And so when I say the same thing to the folks that are on twitter my community on twitter
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.000]   About mastodon and find it an instance or join in twitter that social
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.360]   Everybody's eyes just sort of glaze over like
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.960]   It just it just doesn't click
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.480]   The thing is signing up at a mastodon server is exactly like signing up at twitter
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.600]   The thing is hard for the thing that's hard for people to get is that there isn't one mastodon
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.800]   It's not just one right and there is one twitter and what i'm saying is people have this centralized
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.200]   notion that everything has to be centralized is part of the problem
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:56.920]   Yeah, and because twitter was centralized now this guy elan muskets to decide look what twitter did with chex this morning
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.080]   marques brownlee tweets
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:04.920]   Oh great. There are now two verified chex one that shows next to your profile the blue the old blue check
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.160]   In retweets and everywhere it means your twitter blue subscriber the other one official
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.720]   Shows up on certain profiles
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.080]   Uh, because you're official to which elan says
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.160]   To which elan says oh no never mind and cancels it
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.840]   killed yeah, he literally was there for an hour
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.440]   Because elan in his infinite wisdom said no
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.880]   It's great the the machine, you know, there's a great emforster story that was ahead of its time called the machine stops
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.680]   It's an incredible account of everyone becoming dependent on machines and living underground because the earth
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.400]   Becomes too polluted and everyone lives individually and they communicate through wall screens
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.960]   I mean, it's a story. It was written 120 years 130 years ago
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.760]   It's ridiculous how much it seemed like the pandemic period among other things
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.000]   And but I feel like we're in that stage where things start breaking down at twitter already
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.320]   I was trying to post images on a tweet today and twitter split it into two messages
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   One was the tweet and one was the tweet with the images
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.640]   People are saying correct messages are becoming public and
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.440]   Talking about that. Yeah, this is a an article by
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.800]   a former twitter
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.120]   Engineer you put this in jeff. Let me see if I can uh find it
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.640]   This is this is the one who says the number one. It's about to fall apart. Oh, that one
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.040]   Yeah, it is all this is from mit's technology review
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.680]   Uh, chrystokowattar Walter
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.720]   Great reporter chris by the way god. My verification chrystokowattar great reporter
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.760]   But what chris could do is go to mastodon put a link
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:45.640]   Oh wired well. Well, well, what if he's a freelancer who works only once before this publication?
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.800]   He writes for tech and they don't really want him to do that
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.720]   So you think it's better that he then goes to who's this guy a trade
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.640]   I think but jeff's point is look i'm going to argue this point with you jeff because it's
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.680]   It's uh, we're gonna tag team wrestling thing. I don't think and it's gonna
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:05.960]   I don't know are you gonna tag in with with leo but it's uh, you know, I believe in the power of independent trade organizations that help people
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.760]   Uh, develop credibility apart from what they work for if they work for somebody as a freelancer
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.200]   It's very hard to develop credibility and chris is a fellow freelancer
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.160]   So, you know, if I want to prove i'm a journalist and I write for 15 different publications
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.800]   I want a centralized but not centrally owned
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:31.880]   Organization I want a american journalist association of america or whomever to have the ability to say glenn is in our directory
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   and if that shows up as a
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.360]   Mastodon style verification that's how you do it profile you profile they would great
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.160]   If there if instances develop a different mechanism that is a different kind of thing
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:48.120]   And it only offers a badge for people on that instance and other instances may not even show it
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.760]   I think that's okay too because it's better. I am
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.600]   And I understand it's complicated for people but I am a big fan of open indie web open web and micro formats
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:03.240]   And this is a micro formats thing. It's been around for at least a decade maybe two the rel.me tag
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.880]   Uh, and honestly
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.080]   This is the way to do it so that no company
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   No, no
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.320]   Capitalist nobody can control it. It is it is grassroots and yet it's well thought out to provide
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:26.840]   Rock solid verification now is when i register if you have a site when I let you know if I register your journalist organization your
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:34.920]   You know association of independent freelance journalist could do it too. You could say member i fgbc 3 3
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.680]   Yeah, and then it would have a green check because they in their directory put rel.me next to your name
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:47.880]   All right. We have a meeting of lines. I think we're good. I promise not to register. I am leo la port.com and verify it on mastodon
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.840]   You could but then somebody who was wondering is that the leo la port might go to twit and say oh no
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.920]   Isn't the real leo port or go to or to go to the association of independent podcasters or whatever
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.080]   Fakatka see part of my reason. I don't buy this is because
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.840]   Podcasters are trying to do this forever. There's like 15 different
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.320]   O lane organizations for podcasters. They have a very clear i-hade
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.720]   Hall of fame awards every three years. There's a new one with different hall different hall
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.320]   Um, I hate certification of journalists. I am
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:25.960]   I'm early on. I'm the guy who said anybody can commit an act of journalism. I don't want official certification journalism
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.840]   I so that's why then you certify yourself. I don't want bloggers to have a series
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.800]   I'm fine with that, but there are a lot of people who don't do what I do
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.520]   And don't have the abilities that I have
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.000]   Um, and I have my own blog and I have a university and I have these other things I can do
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.240]   A lot of people don't have those
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.200]   Well, if you have no to okay, I agree
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:52.120]   If you have no digital presence, then it's hard to use rel.me if you have no you don't exist in the digital world
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.320]   Then you can't use rel.me if you don't control your digital presence, which is
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.640]   Well, I would submit that you should find a way to control your digital presence
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.600]   You can go but that's by the way, you can rel dust maybe a way to do it
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.560]   You can rel.me to your twitter by the way a lot of people do that
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.080]   I know but that still doesn't tell
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.680]   If somebody wants to say so so we we we teach beauty illiteracy and I also think that's BS
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.280]   But we'll stay with them a second media literacy is know the source you're talking to
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.160]   Who is it you're talking to?
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.080]   How did you find out who this person knows what they are kids or grandpa online?
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.800]   Right?
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.680]   Well, they write for the washington post to some people that works that's fine
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   So people that means that they're they're full of crap
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.560]   They they're on fox news same kind of difference, right?
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.280]   You're giving people some
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.960]   uh, basis for their decisions about the credibility when it comes to journalism
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.280]   Now again, I don't want to restrict journalism
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.400]   I don't want to limit it
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.240]   But what glens been saying is right if there are various options for people
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   So you you just described it. We hope there are
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.160]   If you do the rel.me to this server, that's then fun. There are
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:54.520]   Uh, but I think it's a mistake to look for some centralized authority
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.680]   If you don't want to check one of many options
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.960]   Look what Elon just did to those centralized authorities
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.640]   Yeah, decentralized is really much better. Yes decentralized exactly. Okay. Well, that's all
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.440]   I don't want to say the green on that. I think we're on the same page
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.360]   I mean, there are a lot of Twitter brains who say well, if it's not if there's no central authority
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.440]   We're not saying that. Yeah, good. Not saying
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.960]   So let's be very not saying that this is an option one of many
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.400]   Yeah, I
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.200]   I would
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.680]   I would be a trader in position. That's one it could be a trade organization
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.920]   It could be that's what we're doing the association of police
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.320]   Uh, they were too slow
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.800]   And so adam stepped in and said i'm gonna create this so people get involved in this
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.440]   That's where i think is a mistake because just for but he's one server though. He's not going to be for everybody
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.200]   He's not gonna be a journalist
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.400]   And it's and it's no but you can see he's already having trouble because
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.360]   Unfortunately, journal dot horse is being blocked by a lot of mastodon instances
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:51.960]   Because the people on there some mastodon instances have decided are sensationalist or tabloid
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.480]   And have blocked the entire instance which is their loss
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.840]   They can they're right? Is it is it or
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.000]   Or so he'd add it
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.480]   I don't understand the culture he was entering
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.600]   And stumbled in and did the wrong thing
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.040]   Himself said today. No one should block you. There's no reason to block you. He responded personally doesn't matter
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   There's no central authority
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.280]   No, he's the central authority. What this is your twitter brain
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.040]   But he can disagree with you. I would say is you got your another central authority either
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:27.160]   No, this is an democracy. Yeah, but you can does not decide that what adam did was right
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.240]   You know who decides all the mastodon
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.760]   Yes, but and they have the right to federate with him and so some people want to go
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.640]   What he broke what he wanted to do it got the wrong effect
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.160]   That's all that's all the only way to judge this say some people
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.120]   But this is like this is like the early days of the net in the longest september the end was the end of september
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.840]   Then whatever the september was I just I'm saying he is the net
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.480]   You don't have to change it was an unforced error changed
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.120]   He didn't have to make this mistake if he had understood the culture he was barging into
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:01.400]   I'm gonna I'm gonna I want to derail this slightly because I think there is an a great example of something that works
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   I mean I was mentioning SSL certificates or
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:08.120]   I'm old so it's actually Tss TLS certificates now for the last many years
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.280]   But but DNS domain nurming system dates back to gosh. I've lost track
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.960]   It's like 50 years old 45 years old something like that. It's an amazing
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:23.320]   Robust system that's made of chewing gum and bailing wire and it like it's kind of like a seven rube go work machine stapled together
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.720]   And yet it stayed together in an incredible
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:33.000]   Mix of decentralization centralization. There are some authorities that run parts of it to make sure it works and others that are
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.200]   Totally they could all be enemies of each other, but everyone agrees that the power of being able to
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:45.400]   To resolve a human readable domain name and other technical stuff into an address on the internet is so important
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.840]   That it overcomes many of the issues
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:55.800]   That have to do with giving up seeing a little bit of your authority. Um, I like to come back to uh, it's an arcosindicalism, right?
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.720]   It's a great, uh, a great political structure in which everyone's running their own anarchy
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:06.600]   They have their own rules there may be no rules, whatever, but you syndicate together you federate and you agree that we have these interoperable rules
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.320]   And so nobody tells anybody else precisely what to do but because of that everyone has to agree together
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.520]   And the internet is partly an aposynicate, but DNS really is there's really nobody
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.960]   Except at a very top very technical layer that kind of
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.880]   Says here's where things point to and occasionally third parties have said we don't believe in DNS
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.720]   It's run too dictatorially
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.120]   We're going to break off and form alternate DNS or or form systems are outside of the power
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.640]   The hegemony of the united states that's led this or different international groups
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.960]   And they fail because the power of
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:44.040]   Anarchy is agreeing to a set of rules that generally work pretty well has proven out to win
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.720]   And so I kind of hope
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:51.160]   That's where mastodon wins out is that you have lots of different approaches and whatever wins is gonna be the one
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.680]   Make maybe here. Let me postulate this to both of you too is that maybe adam did make a mistake
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.360]   Maybe journaled a host was a bad idea and journalists should have all bugged out
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.840]   You know talking about mash earlier they should have all bugged out joined all kinds of different servers
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.960]   And not collected into one place because being at one place is uh provides a single point of
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.280]   People being angry at journalism or angry at a specific journalist. Maybe it was bad idea or maybe it was a great idea
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.000]   And in two years there's 50,000 journalists there and everyone agrees
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.800]   This is the most credible place to be and everyone has a rel me tag
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.440]   Pointing to journal host if they're a journalist
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.360]   So we won't know what shakes out
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.120]   But what I love is we all get to experiment and figure this out in real time with
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.920]   Felios point nobody gets to say this is a bad idea and shut it down
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.280]   Everybody and to me this is the real moral of what's happening
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.640]   Is it for the first time in my living memory?
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.400]   Finally people have gotten fed up with this idea of siloed
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.080]   uh
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.600]   corporate-owned media in the on the internet world and and for the first time ever
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.400]   a centralized
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   You know open system has started to win over a centralized system and to me that's a huge
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.440]   victory
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.440]   And so that's why I want to defend
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.920]   The culture of mastodon by the way you you don't have to be on mastodon to be in the fediverse
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.120]   You could it's just activity pub you can have your own personal microblog do it
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.280]   You can have any way you want to do it and I do think journal host is going to be fine
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.760]   And so it's a he he had the right idea. He just he didn't he didn't
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.480]   Do it diplomatically enough and then people who are blocking him
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.280]   Are also not understanding that you don't have to block the entire server you block the individuals
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.440]   I can block any individual
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.760]   You don't have to follow no one there. I can I can see if you're excited
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.680]   That's all you know there that howard stirns on gernead. I'd host but I don't want him on mine
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.560]   I just can block him and no one on my yeah instance can follow him or even see what he's posting
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.440]   So you have a granular control of that individual one thing I want you to like about this
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:04.760]   Individuals go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I know that no that's one that is one of the things I do like about this versus twitter
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.840]   Where I can literally just block it an entire instance because I make the decision to say that instance
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.920]   It's just gonna be you can do it for yourself. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, it's this more curation in my hands
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.120]   I actually give give and you mentioned you jin who is
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:27.720]   Actually our gargran who is actually your jin rottko rottko who's a german programmer who wrote mastodon some years ago
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:33.400]   Uh, but really should emphasize mastodon is using activity pub activity
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.640]   Zodas pleroma, so does pixel fed
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:43.800]   So does so do many many micro blogs so many other things use it and the it's the real secret is activity pub here
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:50.760]   It is it is a micro format. It is a protocol that is open when did it start? Oh, it's at least 10 years old
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.360]   I know this is that's where I didn't I'd understand when blue sky started
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.920]   It felt like another attempt to have sort of a centralized decentralized thing that it was like well
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:04.040]   We didn't we weren't involved in this and and blue sky doesn't interoperate with activity pub right there
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.920]   No, in fact, we had this conversation with rabble a few weeks ago who is doing scuttlebutt
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:16.600]   Which is also not activity pub and I said why don't you use activity pub and he had some reasonable technical issues chief of which
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.200]   Uh scuttlebutt gives you a unique
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.480]   Certificate-based identity that is portal
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.560]   So and this is the big problem with mastodon you in fact in a way describe this if I had a unique identity
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.680]   I could have three mastodon accounts, but they are unique identity
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.280]   If I wanted to move servers, I could move the whole thing just by moving this
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.000]   certificate so
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.800]   That is something I think mastodon could have done better and it still could
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.400]   Uh or act maybe it's active maybe it's a limited activity pub that's the question
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.280]   I think it's at the mastodon level, but I'm not sure because I would I mean I would love that as a thing is like something like again
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:55.480]   This is the the choice factor too is public key cryptography is so well
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.160]   Distributed around into all kinds of things that we use
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.680]   You know a trillion times a day across all sorts of different software
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:07.960]   But then it's exposed and things like key base.io and I'm sorry the one that you use and it catch the name of the um
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.760]   For registering your digital certificate. Yeah, it's personal digital stuff. I forgot to
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.800]   There's a couple now keys.pub is former key base guys and the one I love that
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:26.040]   Yeah, the one I use is uh, I don't see this is part of the problem is that these things don't last
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.560]   So it's got bought by somebody soon like I bought the team they didn't buy key base
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.280]   And that's part of the problem. So I use key oxide, which actually I kind of like
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:42.360]   Um, but it's a way of providing, you know, that's where if I need to find a public key or you see my keys
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.000]   But also verify this is the same use on many
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.080]   Yeah using a similar technique to rail about me. So this so if you believe this is me
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.200]   And which you can do based on the fact that all of these things are owned by me
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.160]   What does this again because I
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.120]   Oxide.org. Well, see it solves a problem. Yeah, there's that whole thing. I don't I mean I don't know
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.440]   I feel like I've been having to mess with public keys
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.120]   Uh, well since twice the age of my children, right since like the or
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   1990s it feels like Phillips
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   Came up with the pretty good
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:21.400]   Protocol right for bgp and uh, the big problem all along was there were key servers, but key servers were 100
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:30.440]   Unreliable their expiration issues. So it's like if I need to send you aunt a message that's signed with uh, with a key that you've publicly posted
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.360]   Uh, what if the key is expired? What if it's been compromised? What if it's not an?
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.400]   So this is the key base at least, uh, and some of these other servers have been trying to settle that problem
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:44.120]   So without I mean, I think it got solved in one level if you have end-to-end encryption
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:49.000]   Instant messaging clients like iMessage and WhatsApp if you're not doing cloud archiving
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.240]   Uh, then they're doing skype even like they're dealing with key management for you
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.400]   So you don't need to know someone else's fortunately they're always tied to your phone number
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:03.960]   Yeah, which is probably something or a device to like apple ties, but then you're locked in there
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.040]   So I like the idea of independently held keys and management is an issue
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.400]   But so these sites like keybase let you take a key register it only published the public part
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.000]   But then validate that it's you by using all kinds of other things
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.720]   That like a cluster of stuff that together forms your online identity
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.680]   And they're all using uh the same kind of code a code
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.720]   You're the only one who should be able to post to all those different places like github and twitter and
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.640]   Facebook and websites and so forth. So someone goes to keybase
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:41.320]   This is oh, this really is glana and I can trust this public key or I can use this account because I see a cluster of validated stuff and a cryptographic
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.360]   cryptographic component uh mastodon coty into something like uh that or uh
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.400]   Well, again, it doesn't need to behind it, uh because I verified their key oxide
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:58.920]   I think for your purposes ant key oxides probably easier than keys dot pub keys dot pub was started by a former key bacer
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.160]   Uh, but I think it's a little bit obscure. I understand it
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:08.440]   But a little I'm not going to recommend it. This one's a little easier. You just go to key oxide show this place
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.280]   You go to key oxide
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.360]   Um, and you could see it has a mastodon key and there's the checkbox
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.920]   It's pretty easy to create a not just started looking at the dock for them
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.760]   Yeah, I mean look at if you thought rail dot me was too hard for people. This is
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.720]   100 times worse
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:30.920]   This is why I'm a big fan of uh, you know the web authentication web off and you know, that's become very popular
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.720]   It's uh phyto 2 is like the friendly name for it. I think sort of and I
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.080]   I love it because it
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.560]   Pass keys pass. I'm sorry pass keys is the friendly name, right? So I love pass keys because pass keys
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:48.680]   uh package all the complexity and utility of public key cryptography inside something you as an individual
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.880]   Don't have to manage like I'd be comfortable teaching someone to use a mat pass key because literally it's a fingerprint
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.880]   Uh that they can authorize something with the enrollment process is trivial
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:03.480]   Um, where as something like keybase or key oxide are or key pass or all dramatically dramatically
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.600]   More complicated. They're meant for a more technical audience, but um, you could use pass keys
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.080]   I just like the sense that there's a way to cryptographically
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.520]   Prove your identity beyond just a link but then to be able to
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.400]   Federate all these different elements of yourself online and it's something that then proves that you know
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.920]   The public identity you're using is accurate as well. This is this is kind of one of the central problems of uh, the internet
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.440]   It's certainly a central problem of uh payment systems is uh
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:35.720]   Authentication and people are very reluctant to have a, you know, universal driver's license or federal id which I understand
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.960]   Um, it seems like the internet should facilitate this kind of thing, but right now it's still pretty
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.680]   Key key. I'd be curious and uh set it up and see and see how it works for you
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   I have a key oxide signature
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.800]   On many of my sites and on my mastodon
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.320]   So if you click that link on mastodon you would then go to key oxide
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:39:00.280]   It's very hard to spoof that because whoever was pretending to be me would have to have control of all of my sites including right
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:07.000]   So it's very hard to spoof that so it's a it's a good system, but I have a lot of sites, right? So you're right
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.280]   Uh, you know queen prue it she has one site
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.800]   But if you can show her how to use that site to verify her identity, that's a big step
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.760]   Towards putting yourself
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.960]   On the net in a way that's provably you and I think that's turns out to be just as we were saying glenn
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:31.400]   You were saying very very important. I want to give credit to evan pro-dromo because he kind of started this right at when twitter started
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:38.360]   Uh just a year later. He started idenica. We had an idenica server at twit the twit army server some folks will remember
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:44.040]   Remember that yeah that that might morph to the ganoo social which is these are all activity pub
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.000]   kind of early activity pub precursors evans one of the authors of activity pub
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.560]   um along with christine leber webber who some people will know and
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.400]   Uh some really well-known people. This is a w3c
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.440]   uh proved um protocol so
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.720]   Honestly, I think this is a good way going forward to create these kinds of
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.040]   Desiload
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.720]   Social networks one of the reasons I think masted on and I think discord two are very powerful is because they're
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:20.440]   Small and local and a lot of people came on to twit. That social said oh, this is like what twitter was in 2008
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:25.320]   You know, yeah, it felt that way right like i'm never quite friendly and quiet
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.840]   And I got to ask you question because I know you're the youngest person here is uh, will you on bbs
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.920]   Is as a kid or is that before your time the dial up?
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.400]   That's before my time see it masted on to me at some level. I mean it's grown so fast
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.120]   It's like when I joined like when I started using it seriously 10 days ago or eight days ago, right?
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:47.480]   That was serious about it. It was sort of like bbs's you had a bunch of tin cans and you're holding them up to your ear
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.200]   And they're all kind of dialing each other up and it's kind of slow and you're talking to other nerds
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.560]   And there's not a lot of conversation
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:58.200]   It's all kind of a certain topics and then it went through it was like watching sped up evolution
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.520]   And it's like do we don't want it to become twitter because twitter has so many problems
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:08.200]   But we also want to have a global tin can of some kind we just don't want the tin can to cut us
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.040]   I don't know that's some I'm losing my metaphor help. I ran uh
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.840]   A fight onet in the mid 90s bbs
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.920]   And one of the things that fight onet did and was intended to do was federate
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:25.240]   So you had it was very much masted on you had a local instance you were part of a local community that was small
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.320]   But you could follow anybody on any other phyto community
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.400]   Worked really well
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.640]   And I think that is the best of both worlds
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:38.920]   By the way already the verified blue check is becoming a massive
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.760]   Problem on twitter libs of tick tock have purchased a blue check
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:51.560]   So that and some people recognize the first the worthless now. It is the blue check of the schmuck
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.360]   It's anybody with eight bucks. Yeah, that's all it is
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:02.280]   Uh, and so the problem is this is now meaning. I mean they've destroyed their authentication system
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.760]   when we talked about this last week
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:13.640]   Are we being unfair to assume that no one on the new twitter leadership staff understands what verification means
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.200]   Well, I think the problem is that elon
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.640]   Doesn't I think there are people
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.440]   Um
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:28.040]   But quite a few people in this so-called in-air circle. There's there a couple of x twitter people including the head a product bacapour who's the back
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.600]   Uh at least advising
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:36.440]   All right, all right, so that I would expect that they would be saying hey, he on you know, you don't want to break this system
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:42.680]   Right now the blue check is coming off as a receipt and not necessary. Thank you. That's a very good way to put it on
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.880]   That's really well said. Yeah, and what sanny's I mean I have a blue check from the old days. I guess
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.680]   Now that I don't play pay twitter
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.520]   The eight bucks. I guess I'll lose it at some why no I got a notification today leo
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.880]   Did you that that that billing they're gonna kill my account
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.440]   Oh, there's no, like, oh Gee, do you want to convert Jeff?
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.820]   No, no, no, they're going to get up.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.440]   They're going to take kill your Twitter account.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.620]   I put it. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:07.980]   Put a blue.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.700]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, they're going to kill my blue or you're on the
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.940]   converted blue.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.220]   Oh, you have to sign up again in other words.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.680]   I put it up in the car stellar routine.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.880]   That's not a good system.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.560]   Just take the well, this is again, because he fired a lot of the engineers and of course,
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.820]   the latest rumor is that he's asked a few of them to come back, let me
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.400]   go.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.400]   You're going to be holding in flag on the table somewhere.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.160]   Right.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.440]   No, it's a bit.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.640]   It's literally just a bit.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.800]   I just want to point out that, you know, nobody disagrees with.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.120]   I think I don't think I, I don't think I'm taking a legal stance when I say it's
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.640]   pretty clear that Twitter's firings violated California and possibly federal law.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.160]   But I do love that the penalty is that you have to pay people, essentially what
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.840]   you'd pay if you gave them layoff notice.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.720]   So Twitter seems to be poised to do that.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.400]   So yeah, they're going to give her three months.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.360]   I don't work here, but I'm getting a chance money.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.200]   But what that means is that you're still working in hooly.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.080]   They can recall you though, because you're still.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.120]   Oh, so there have been reports.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.360]   So now don't, you know, so there have been reports of this and I haven't seen it like
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.680]   verified by that's fast and that some people who've been recalled and said, I'm
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.920]   not coming back and they said, great, if you don't want to come back, you're
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.320]   not getting the extra stuff.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.480]   Yeah, you're going to get the severance, but they won't get the additional thing.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.760]   So if you're somebody thought through that, yeah, I know weird, huh?
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.040]   Well, he thought through that after somebody said, Elon, there's this thing
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.120]   called the warne act and you're in violation of it.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.600]   And it is, by the way, it's very expensive.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.800]   I think it's $500 a day per violation.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.320]   You better do something else.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.680]   I'll bet I'll bet the write ups.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.840]   I'll bet the letters to the employees.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:52.480]   Didn't say that.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.240]   No, just bet.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.800]   Can I contrast this, by the way, in very sad day, I really, it is a sad day for
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.240]   everybody who lost their job at Twitter.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.360]   Now 11,000 meta employees are going to lose their job.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.720]   But can I contrast the way Elon handled it with the way Mark handled it?
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.320]   Because I think that's, and we've given.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.240]   The letter is pretty amazing.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:16.360]   We've given Mark a lot of, you know, hard times over the past few years, but I
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.960]   was very impressed.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.880]   This letter, he takes full responsibility.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.120]   He, he acknowledges how hard this is.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.200]   He says, how do in this section, how do we get here?
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.840]   I thought this was very graceful.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.920]   At the start of COVID, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.600]   led to outsized revenue growth.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.240]   continue even after the pandemic ended.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.400]   I did too.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.640]   Not we.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.800]   I did too.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.960]   So I made the decision to significantly increase our investments.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.680]   Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:01.240]   I got this wrong and I take responsibility for that.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.480]   Now that doesn't take you.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:06.160]   He's a lot of this thing out of getting fired, but he is the very good,
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.280]   so it looks like very good severance packages.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.440]   16 weeks, six weeks per year.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   They're going to, they're going to give you six months of health insurance.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.640]   They're going to help people find work.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.200]   It's pretty generous.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:18.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.480]   That's good.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.520]   It's as good as it can be.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   Look, layoffs happen.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.040]   We've had to do layoffs.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.680]   You know, I think he's not alone.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.520]   I think almost every tech company foolishly perhaps thought that the
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:34.120]   expansion that we saw during COVID, which was very good for tech, made added
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:38.520]   trillions of dollars to the bottom line, was, was, you know, you have to hire, right?
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.040]   You have to.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.800]   But this is, this is the good part for people who took those jobs, though.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.000]   Is they hired a lot of people.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.040]   They paid a lot of people very high salaries, not everybody.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.040]   And almost everybody who's hired at these various companies got stock and
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.240]   options and restricted stock units and so forth.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.600]   So if you got a job during that period, you got two years of ostensibly pretty good pay.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.920]   You felt very reliable.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.640]   You were doing something that you felt was interesting.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.480]   And maybe you got hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars worth of stock,
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.120]   honestly, because of the run up.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.760]   So it's a different position than say,
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.160]   well, it's a stock down now.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.080]   Well, yeah.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.440]   I mean, you're not if you work for Tesla or Facebook, Facebook stock is not worth the paper.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.240]   It's written on, unfortunately.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.080]   Right.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.920]   The old people at Twitter got paid out of 50, 40, right?
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.480]   Well, there wasn't.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.760]   I don't know again, it's hard to know what really happened, but there was, of course, this.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.160]   Story that Elon was going to say you were fired for cause.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.520]   So you don't, you don't get your golden handcuffs, parag and others.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:39.960]   Very much in contrast, Zuckerberg in his letter says everyone impacted will get their
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:45.440]   November 15th stock grants and will vest November 15th, even though we're.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.880]   We're going to let you go before then.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.000]   That's exactly the opposite.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.880]   Now, look, it's horrible.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.880]   There's 11,000 good people who are out of work and I, you know, I feel for them.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.920]   People there and I feel for the 3000.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.480]   Twitter's who are Twitter is who?
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.640]   I mean, I'm sure all these people loved their job, more most of them.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.400]   And are hurt.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.080]   It's a very hurtful thing to lose your job.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:07.760]   I understand that.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.920]   But boy, this is a real contrast the way.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.640]   What a contrast.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   What a contrast.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.000]   Yes.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.200]   I think I think I think Nick Kleg probably had
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.640]   some role in that because I think he's smart at communications.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.680]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.800]   It's a good communication.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.920]   And and and had the ability to sit down and say, what does it mean to do this?
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.200]   Right.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.320]   Let's do it that way.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.080]   And, you know, Lyft has been for everybody's been laying people off.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.760]   So this is this is a grim time right now.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.400]   I can be real.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.080]   I can be really cruel here and say, well, Nick, like has a lot of experience
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.520]   from his political past is making a lot of people really disappointed in taking
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.440]   responsibility for massive errors that he's made.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.440]   So he's he's the perfect person for this.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.760]   He knows how to make a mistake.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.560]   He knows with grace and a lawn.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.000]   Oh, somewhere I thought I put in the rundown.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.920]   A a layoff tracker.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.480]   Oh, God, well, let's not look at that.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.200]   Let me take a break.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.600]   They're there.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.480]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.840]   Really fun to have you guys.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.720]   I apologize for my strong language earlier.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.360]   There was no strong roles.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.040]   We play roles.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.200]   I wasn't playing a role.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   I feel defensive and Matt Mastodon because
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.120]   I want it.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:17.520]   I want open source decentralized to win.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   I can see how centralized closed source has hurt us.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.840]   Amen.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.480]   And I and I just want it to win so badly.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:33.920]   So I want to make sure that people stop pause and try to understand this new idea
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.600]   instead of bringing these old habits from the centralized.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.360]   But the only way to say you you want it to work, but it's going to take some
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.600]   work on both sides.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.040]   It's going to take work from you.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.640]   It's going to take work from the people that are curious about it.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.000]   Change and I agree.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.800]   In fact, you know, my initially kind of thought, Oh, I don't want to let all these
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.240]   people in.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.600]   I almost closed twins.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.200]   That's so true.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.320]   Mind down.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.560]   I've made mine private so I could sort of that's probably smart.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.280]   People, you know, as an administrator, it's an interesting role.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:09.760]   I didn't want the look, the culture that exists is beautiful.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:14.640]   But it really is a very gentle culture, things like content warnings and so forth
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:20.240]   are very different from the way the the the fractious, you know,
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.080]   brawling space that the octagon of Twitter.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.400]   And I kind of wanted to protect our instance, but then I thought, well,
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.200]   it's so good to have these new people.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.000]   And there is such vitality that's been brought.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.600]   And the good thing about doing it in, you know, with our community, one thing I
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.160]   have done is been very careful about promoting it outside our community.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.560]   So most of the people are Twitter people who have learned about it on Twitter.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.040]   And I think that that's what I was something else I said last week,
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.760]   because Mr. Jarvis was going on about it and singing its praises at the same time.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.480]   I'm like, I get that, but I'm not really interested in meeting a whole lot of other
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:55.960]   folks.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.480]   I just want to keep the core that I have.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:03.160]   And fortunately the Twitter that social core is part of it.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.480]   And it's put people, but there's two things here.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.720]   What is that, Leo, you're providing a service for people who are entering
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.360]   into the new world.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.080]   So is Adam and Journer.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.200]   There's a lot of Queen Pruitt's out there who want to play here, but don't want to
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:22.960]   have to go through a, you know, an education.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.200]   Why do I need three remotes to turn on the TV?
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.800]   Yeah, just look, I can start to do this.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.200]   And so I think there's a spirit of service, which I think is important.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.560]   Well, and everybody's doing that.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.080]   I think though that I don't was Adam and administrative before.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.200]   Had he been, had he been a master?
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.080]   No, he was the first to say that he's doing that.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.000]   That's that's part of the problem.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.880]   But we didn't, but the thing was we were getting bombarded by people who, you know,
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.800]   I learned how to do this because of you and I'm here.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.560]   Yeah, he jumped in, barbed him by people and it needed a, how do we get it?
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.240]   I agree.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:54.960]   And it needed to happen.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:00.880]   And by the way, I used, I followed a whole bunch of people at Journer.host.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.560]   One of the hardest things, one of the things that Matt doesn't do very well,
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.600]   I guess Twitter wasn't all that good at it either was discovery.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:14.240]   And the explorer is better than Twitter was actually the advantage of Journer.host/explore
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   folks is you can see exactly who's on there.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:16.480]   Right.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.200]   And follow them.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.120]   And it's a little hard to follow people.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.200]   What other instances?
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.560]   It's not as easy as just clicking a follow button.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.000]   It's three clicks better.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.480]   Is three clicks is dead or one?
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.400]   Yeah, I will say that.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.440]   Let me show you how you do that actually.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.600]   If somebody is new to this and I, I noticed.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:37.160]   Let's just, I just noticed that, who is it?
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.440]   I think Robert Reich is, is on here.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.320]   Yeah, he just joined.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.880]   Stephen Fry is on here.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.440]   That's an honor.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   A lot of people help.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.720]   Fry actually killed his Twitter account.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:48.200]   He's done that.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.160]   I believe he's good at it.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   So there's right.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.040]   Stephen Fry once, Stephen Fry once replied to my wife on Twitter back in the early days
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.920]   to answer a question she had about.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.560]   So somebody with rat poison is very funny.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.320]   He's amazing.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.560]   Man, he is an amazing show.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.440]   Anyway, so I'm already following him, but let's unfollow for a moment, Robert Reich.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.400]   Well, this isn't a good example because I just click the top.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.360]   No, go to it.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.320]   Go explore.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.360]   Let's go to Jordan.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.600]   Let's go to Jordan.host.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.080]   That's a good.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:16.640]   That's a good idea.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.720]   Keep finding that changes depending on which client I'm using and what day.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.840]   Sometimes it's a click and a follow button.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.040]   Sometimes I have to do something much more elaborate.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:28.600]   And I haven't figured out why if it's like a federation issue or a fight.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.480]   It is.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.240]   There's two different things you might get.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.440]   So let's say I want to follow Alex Boyd, which I do.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.960]   So I'm going to click follow.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.200]   Now this is the one.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.840]   This is one of two different things you might see.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.440]   So here I'm going to see my name at Twitter social.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.040]   Fill that in.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.600]   And because I'm logged in, there's a token on this browser.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.200]   It's just that.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.760]   So that's pretty easy.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.480]   Oh, OK.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.960]   OK, that's pretty easy, but it isn't.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.320]   You're right.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:54.760]   It's not.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   Let me see.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.720]   By the way, it doesn't tell you now that you're following him there because
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.840]   the journal.host doesn't know that you're following.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.560]   No, but says here success you were falling.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.400]   I don't know about that.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.360]   If you go through the list, I already followed all these.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.520]   So here I'm seeing Adam himself not following him.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.360]   Let's follow him.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.520]   That's going to be the same, unfortunately.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.320]   Sometimes what you get is you have to copy.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.240]   Paste in your profile, copy in his profile name.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.320]   So I'll show you how you would you could do that.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.840]   I'm going to copy his profile name.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.880]   Go back to my mastodon.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.480]   Go back to my mastodon.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.960]   Oh, I know where I know what's going.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.240]   No, I don't know what's going on.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.760]   What's going on?
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.840]   It's as easy as one to it's easy.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.920]   Oh, somehow I've kind of merged these together.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.120]   Let me go back to mine.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.120]   I'm going to go to Twitter social.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   Oh, I see what I did.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.520]   I'm I'm a my book.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.960]   Yeah, let me go back to my Twitter social.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.280]   Then you just paste that into the search box
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.320]   and hit return.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.560]   That will give you the same Bennett same result.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.520]   And then you follow just by clicking that.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.760]   Hey, I think we all was playing with.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:54:59.920]   Go ahead. You go first.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.280]   Oh, can I can I give you some real time follows
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.240]   thing we already talking about 20 minutes ago,
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.240]   according to the BBC, Binance has walked away from its FT.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.160]   Oh, let's watch that one.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.080]   Yeah, after due diligence of what 16 hours,
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.800]   it would not pursue the crypto world is falling apart.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.720]   We'll talk about that real time in just a minute.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.200]   In real time, absolutely.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.040]   It's an amazing thing that's going on.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.720]   We've got a great panel and all mastodonistas,
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.400]   but all Twitter is too, apparently.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   Who knew?
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.720]   I'm going to encourage you to do what I've done on your lower third
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.080]   and just put your mastodon.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   Glen, play.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.680]   I got a book to sell.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.080]   He's got a website.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.600]   Glenn Dodd fun. Yeah, that's right.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.520]   You know, I told Lisa.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.600]   I said, I don't want us to promote Twitter on Twitter anymore.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.360]   She said, well, that's too bad.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.680]   We're going to get on Lisa.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.000]   Yeah, Lisa.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.560]   You want to sleep on the couch?
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.120]   No, no, it's OK.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:54.320]   Well,
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:03.520]   Jeff Jarvis at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter bitly bit.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.880]   I'll lie slash by Gutenberg for the new book,
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.360]   which doesn't come out until next year.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.000]   So you'll be pre ordering.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.200]   But that's fine.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.680]   And at Pruitt, he's the host of Hands-On Photography.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.360]   And what I will gladly do for you,
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.720]   and what we can do for all of our hosts is add the rail.me
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.560]   to your Twitter profile, your personal page on Twitter.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.680]   I'm on Twitter.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.440]   Did I say Twitter?
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.880]   Oh, shoot me now.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.240]   Just shoot me now. I got Twitter brain.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.280]   We'll put it on your Twitter profile.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:29.960]   Here comes Lisa.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.480]   Come in back.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.360]   Lisa, can I come in?
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.400]   Can I come to bed tonight?
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.520]   Is it OK?
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.920]   Do I have to sleep on the couch?
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.960]   No, because we're not leaving Twitter.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.680]   OK, fine.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.760]   Ellen boss.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.560]   Tell me.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.880]   Today will come.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.560]   You'll regret that young lady.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.240]   House is not a democracy.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.800]   No.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.880]   Well, she's she financial officer.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.760]   She's chief executive officer and she's chief monetization officer.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:03.120]   So if we want to keep the lights on, then we better I better keep this.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.600]   Yeah, nice person.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.680]   Thank you, Miss Lisa.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.040]   Yeah, thank you, Miss Lisa.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.760]   Learn to say that.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.840]   Thank you, Miss Lisa.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.440]   Hey, I'll tell you one thing.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:16.080]   The reason I want to sleep on the couch, our sponsor, eight sleep.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.720]   My bed is so cozy.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.200]   So nice.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.640]   It's so toasty.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.000]   It's been getting cold winners here in the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.680]   Now, for our Australian listeners, it's getting hotter, isn't it?
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.080]   In the Southern Hemisphere, but the beauty about the eight sleep pod cover.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.440]   It takes care of both situations.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.720]   It is an amazing technology.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.600]   You can either get it as a mattress.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.440]   We loved our mattress.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.400]   So about a year ago, I bought the pod cover.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.920]   Actually, they have a new pod three cover.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.080]   I'll tell you about that in a second, but we have the pod two.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.800]   It's a tech layer that fits onto your mattress.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:49.880]   It's like a fitted sheet.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:56.000]   The pod dynamically cools and heats does both each side of the bed
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.960]   to maintain optimal sleeping temperature for what you need, even changing it,
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.600]   depending on your sleep patterns, the temperature in the room and things like that.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:12.400]   It can get as chilly as 55 degrees Fahrenheit as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:16.040]   And and it does it all automatically.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.960]   Now I have it set so that when I get in bed, it's about.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:24.600]   I don't know what it said it at five, which is right in the middle of the 10 zero to 10 scale.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.040]   So I'm guessing it's probably about 98, 90.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.520]   I saw it a little warmer than than the body temperature.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.240]   So feels toasty.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:36.560]   I get in, but one of the things is it turns out, and I think this is just evolutionary biology
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:42.200]   because in the, you know, in the cave or wherever we started out, it would be warmer
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.960]   when you went to bed, but then it would cooled off over through the night, right?
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:51.320]   So it turns out, if you slowly cool down the bed, you go into deeper sleep.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.960]   And that's one of the things the eight sleep does so well is it increases.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.160]   I got an extra half hour of deep sleep every night.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.040]   That's like a 50% increase.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.960]   That's huge.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.360]   Consistent good sleep can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues,
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.920]   decrease the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of alzheimer's
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.200]   and you wake up great.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.720]   So it gets cooler.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.560]   Mine gets cooler.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.080]   They have a sleep doctor that actually monitors your movements,
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.560]   your heart rate, your breathing and the room's temperature.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.240]   It modifies the temperature, cools it off a little bit.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.760]   You don't even notice.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.320]   And then I love this.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.080]   I say, I want to, it says, when do you want to wake up?
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.640]   I say, I want to wake up at eight.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.840]   It starts to warm it up again and eight o'clock.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.040]   Now, actually, this isn't working too well, because I just don't want to get out of bed now,
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.200]   because it's so cold.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.440]   But we don't have to heat the house because the bed keeps us warm.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:40.120]   It actually saves us heating expenses.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:44.480]   Clinical data shows eight sleep users experience up to 34% more.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.000]   Deep sleep.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.640]   That means you feel better.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.280]   Your hormones are better regulated.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.360]   Your physical recovery is better.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.120]   You can wake up.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.320]   You can see your sleep score.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.040]   You can see how you've been doing every night.
[00:59:55.040 --> 01:00:02.160]   It's just, I just, I, the only bad thing is you're not going to want to go travel anymore.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.400]   Because I'll tell you what, you get to a hotel bed and it's just a cold bed.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.880]   It's no fun.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.440]   No fun at all.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.800]   I love my eight sleep.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.000]   We're going to, I'm going to push them to do a travel eight sleep.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.640]   I don't know how they would do that.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.680]   But I really, I would really like that.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.880]   In fact, I'd probably pick a hotel that had eight sleep if they had hotels.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.080]   Take notice.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.640]   The eight sleep, it seems like magic.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.560]   It's not.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.680]   It's better sleeps on your wish list.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.800]   Look no farther than the pod three.

[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.600]   Lisa sleeps differently than me.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.120]   She likes her.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120]   It's really warm.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.200]   Like sometimes I'll reach over and it's like, wow, it's really hot over there.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.320]   She said, yeah, isn't it great?
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.080]   It's so cozy.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.840]   I just love it.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.960]   Eight sleep.com/twig.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.520]   Please use that address so they know you heard it on twig.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.880]   So among many other.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.880]   Crashes in this world today.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.440]   We now have.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.560]   I think it's a crypto crash.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.600]   I like I think it was a what is last month, Jeff, or a couple of months ago.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.680]   I was talking about Sam Bankman, free and saying, this is this.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.320]   Kids amazing, you know, came out of Stanford.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.080]   He's a he's at the time, I think it was worth $6 billion.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.160]   Not anymore.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.160]   You may have seen FTX ads during sporting events.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.920]   They're all over F formula one.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:28.440]   They bailed out a number of collapsing crypto exchanges.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.640]   Sam said, here's some money.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.800]   Stay solvent.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.560]   Who now it's not so good.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.400]   They shut down withdrawals.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.280]   Which implies that they probably couldn't cover it.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.360]   Sam said they had several billion dollars of withdrawals in just a week as crypto
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.240]   starts to go down.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.960]   Binance, as you said, was considering bailing FTX out.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.000]   But the latest Glenn.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.120]   They're not going to do it.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.280]   Yeah, I'm pretty fast, but is it a surprise?
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.480]   I mean, when you're.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.560]   It's very nice when you're on the Titanic and it's sinking, or I should say, it's
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.480]   very nice when you're on a bunch of small boats and it's sinking and the Titanic
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.880]   comes by and offers to let you come aboard.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:19.840]   But you know where that's going and that's kind of what was happening with BTX.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.720]   Like let's take the lifeboards on board the ship that's going down.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.400]   Yeah, it does seem problematic.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.880]   I mean, you did see, you know, this is I've been reading some stuff today about Sam
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.720]   and it's I think he was the friendly face, the happy, friendly face.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.240]   The person seemed to be doing the right thing, the responsible person in the room,
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.640]   the person pushing regulation, all these things.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.400]   And so if his exchange or at least the non-US part of it, I guess, which is the
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.000]   majority crashes and burns and that's, I don't know what happens next and
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   Binance is I don't want, you know, it's there's so many specifics you can't get
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.200]   into because you're like, there's so everything is so fuzzy about them and they
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.520]   deny things that seem to be true and they make statements that are hard to verify.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:08.400]   You know, the founder there, CZ likes to say that they don't really exist in any
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.160]   country, so they're not subject to regulation and yet they have offices in
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.000]   certain countries.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.800]   So it's so the two leading exchanges in the world that are essentially
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.520]   establishing liquidity for cryptocurrency.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:25.120]   One could be about to completely implode and the other has chosen now after saying
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.360]   it would support it not to.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.840]   And I've already, you know, we've seen Lehman Brothers discussion has come up
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.000]   quite a lot.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.520]   But you remember Lehman Brothers didn't go down.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.720]   It was bailed out and then financial global financial system didn't melt down.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.400]   Well, there's nobody who really wants to pick up the pieces, wants to be left
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.240]   as the last hot potato holder as it cools and freezes as we Sam.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   Sam was the rescuer back in the spring of Robinhood.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.040]   Robinhood was illiquid.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.520]   Sam came in, said here's some money.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.600]   It bought a 7.6% stake.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:01.040]   Now Robinhood, based on Sam's problems, is crashing.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.520]   It shares plummeted 15%.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.760]   This is funny because this story from the street says as FTX was acquired to
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.920]   save it from collapsing.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:11.600]   Oh my God.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.840]   Now that we know it's not going to be acquired.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.080]   I wonder what's happening to a lot of.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.280]   Can I ask my dumb question of the moment now?
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:20.760]   Yes.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:28.160]   So when you give a bank money, they're free to use that while it's there and
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.520]   load it out to other people.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.560]   And just as long as they have enough of that money in reserve that when you come
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.840]   to get it, you can get it.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.880]   And it's preserved by the federal government.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.520]   We don't know that your money, Mr.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.120]   Potter, we've invested it in in Joe there.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.040]   He's farmen.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.160]   Yeah, we all learned this in.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.240]   It's a wonderful life.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.280]   So, but now in what it comes to centralize.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.000]   You have a bank.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.720]   Well, banks have to maintain a percentage.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.520]   They take a percentage.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.080]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.640]   I'm just setting that as something as a setup.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.680]   We all know this.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.360]   However, in cryptocurrency, you own what you own and nobody else can get
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.280]   access to it except you.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.880]   So how is it that they can't cover withdrawals because they don't have
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.600]   access to the to the currency?
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.280]   I don't get that.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.520]   So this is a great distinction I saw made.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.840]   I think it was Matt Levine in the excellent Bloomberg newsletter.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.440]   So I'm quoting I'm quoting somebody from memory here, but it's basically
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:28.640]   that like coin, coin base, they have money they hold in trust for you and your
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.960]   wallets or even the wallets.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.200]   They have a wall.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.480]   They call it custodial.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.920]   And so they have like a hundred something billion dollars in assets and
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.040]   a hundred and something billion dollars in debt or whatever, right?
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.360]   Not to have like outstanding money.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.280]   They owe to their people who've invested in or put the money in that, right?
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.640]   So I'm saying that very badly.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.120]   But it's like it's pretty much balanced and they make money on fees.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:56.840]   Yeah, they make money on fees commission fees and going in and out where the whole
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.960]   issue with FDX is that and a lot of these exchanges, all the exchanges were.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.920]   They take your Bitcoin into them and then they borrow money or buy Bitcoin
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.800]   based on the value of those holdings they have.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.560]   So when they don't actually possess them or they don't have that direct access
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.440]   to them, so they can't just give them back to you and they can't give you the
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.200]   money for them.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.840]   Because, you know, it is that it's in Joe's house and Bill's house and.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.400]   I thought this was the whole.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.000]   Let's let Jimmy Stewart explain it.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.360]   I think of you not to do this thing.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.240]   If Potter gets a hold of this building and alone, there'll never be another
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.560]   decent house bill in this town.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.120]   He's already got charged with a bank.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.200]   He's got the bus line.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.560]   He got the department stores and now he's after the Twitter.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.000]   He's got the Facebook.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.840]   The Tesla.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.760]   Because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of red he
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.320]   decides.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.760]   Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you?
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.640]   Well, have you forgotten?
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.040]   Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken down shack?
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:53.640]   Here, you know, you remember last year when things were going so well, you
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.600]   couldn't make your payments?
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.080]   Well, you didn't lose your house, did you?
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.560]   You think Potter would let you keep it?
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.320]   Can't you understand what's happening here?
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.160]   Don't you see what's happening?
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.320]   Potter isn't selling Potter's buying and why?
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.920]   Because we're panicky and he's not.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.760]   That's why he's picking up some bargain.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.440]   Now we can get through this thing.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:10.960]   All right.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.320]   We've got to stick together, though.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.360]   We've got to have faith in the.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.280]   I'm going to get all the big landmarks.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.080]   Hey, did money.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   How am I going to live until the bank opens?
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.400]   I got to go to the place.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:21.800]   I need.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.560]   I can't.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:22.800]   I can't.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.360]   I can't think.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:23.880]   I can't think.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.520]   I got to have.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.520]   How much do you need?
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.600]   Why does she has honey?
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.320]   Is this Sam Bank Freeman?
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:36.480]   Anyway, there's a there's the classic run on the bank scene from It's a wonderful life.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.600]   I think it's no longer in public domain, so please don't take us down.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.800]   That's a long story.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.680]   Turner have it now.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.200]   Somebody has it.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.920]   Yeah, it turned out the rights did not expire.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.640]   That's the problem.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.000]   Whoops.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:48.600]   We're actually up.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:57.000]   But yeah, but it's it's FTX FTX is it's leveraging the assets that it holds for other people just as it would if it were a bank.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.920]   So what I want to take my.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.120]   It's more complicated.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:07.440]   And I think this intentionally more complicated is there's all this also this alameda, which is the exchange that Sam Bank Freeman set up, right?
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:13.440]   Which is I think holding, but then alameda collapsed.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.280]   So alameda was there, I think, right?
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.240]   Was it there?
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.360]   There was it primarily holds the coin, right?
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.760]   There's an FTX coin.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.520]   And if the coin collapsed in value, then what do they?
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.760]   They can't redeem it against.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.800]   They can't exchange it for other like values.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.720]   So they lost.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:37.840]   They had a handout cash to people and the cash was backed by the value of thing that declined in its.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.600]   In the F T X token, which is FTT.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.400]   FTT.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.760]   So it's I mean, it's kind of like a, you know, it's like a run.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.840]   It's like the English pound breaking or something like that.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.760]   It's like a different currency broke and you're like, well, I got to pay out dollars.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.160]   All I got are pounds, but the pound just broke.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.040]   So what do I do?
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.080]   You know, Sam was worth $97 billion in January.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.480]   He is well under a billion right now.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:10.400]   It's a it's a lot of money to lose, but the but the problem partly is and he always said, let's get regulated.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.600]   It's not regulated.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.120]   Although the SEC is now investigating.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:22.880]   According to Bloomberg, Sam Bankman frees FTX Empire faces US probe into client funds and lending.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.720]   The SEC and the CFTC will scrutinize a relationship between FTX.com and FT.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:35.560]   This is I've been saying this for years and my late father-in-law spent, I think, about six years from like 2002 to 2008.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.240]   Saying the housing market is a bubble.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.360]   It's going to collapse at any minute.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.480]   And he was eventually he was right.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.560]   Absolutely right.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.520]   But for years, people were like, yeah, yes, Steve, right?
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.040]   You know, you're any bet against it.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:45.640]   And he won.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.480]   I'm not I have no investment in crypto for against or anything.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.960]   All all my money is in a mattress mattress holdings.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.320]   Those are declined.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.040]   They're declining.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.760]   They're declining pretty fast right now.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.080]   Mine is.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.120]   I'm not as quick as Bitcoin.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.400]   I think Bitcoin lost 20% this week.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.040]   So your mattress holdings are.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.480]   But now they're looking pretty good.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.520]   But so I've been saying liquidity is the issue all along because there is no actual liquidity.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.120]   Your liquidity is based on being the bigger or the lesser fool, right?
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.840]   Is that you're hoping the exchanges because they're not central banks, they cannot have enough money to float the.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.680]   I mean, when they said that Bitcoin and other currencies were worth what?
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.640]   Three trillion dollars together at the peak.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:30.360]   I thought is an illusory value, not just because it seems too high and there's no intrinsic worth in it.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.920]   But it's also because you could not liquid it even a tiny percentage of that.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:40.520]   And then exactly what happened is when there was a run on one small part of the market because of all the cross unregulated
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:46.520]   leverage that was going on, you had you did have runs on exchanges and billions of dollars in cash
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:51.160]   float out, things collapse and you saw the market shrink the value, you know, shrink by what?
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:54.800]   Like 60, 80% over a matter of weeks.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.480]   Now we're seeing a drop 20%.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.800]   The exchanges cannot provide the liquidity.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.920]   There's fewer exchanges.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.680]   Those exchanges are threatened and they have less and less money.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:11.920]   There is no route out where suddenly there's more fiat currency that can be in those exchanges without this massive increase in confidence that isn't going to come with these kinds.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.880]   It was all leveraged.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.080]   It was like a it was like the mortgage crisis, right?
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.080]   It was giant money.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:17.760]   It was leveraged.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.120]   And that was supposed to be the promise of cryptocurrency, right?
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.040]   Was that it was a secure thing.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:30.960]   We know better, but I'm just saying the arguments made were that you control it and only you have the key.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.600]   And if you can't remember your passport, you're screwed.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.200]   But you know, it's still yours.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.920]   I can pass.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.920]   I made I think a hundred dollars in crypto in early 2021.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.920]   I was running a book about it.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.040]   I bought a little bit and then I sold it all and I was like, Oh, damn it.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.080]   I made money off this.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:46.960]   So I had to report it.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.360]   I paid.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:53.720]   So I've made a hundred dollars on cryptocurrency and minus 40% for exactly.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.280]   That's great investment strategy.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:02.040]   By the way, I was just thinking to I bet I bet the reason that you have to
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:09.400]   resubscribe to Twitter, Blue Jeff, I was just thinking is that they want to take it out of the hands of Apple and Google.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.280]   They don't want to pay the 30% big.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:18.200]   So I bet you they're canceling everybody and that the new system will require you go direct through the website.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:18.880]   I'm going to get.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:26.120]   Well, if you want to go to Mac, Mike, back to next Twitter, if you're right, well, right now, he's putting in some beautiful examples about how the new blue check is screen up.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.440]   There's a bad fake Rudy Giuliani.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.960]   There's a bad fake Donald Trump.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.520]   Say books.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:30.920]   It's just.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:39.000]   Yeah, people are people are coming in the wits and of Twitter coming in right off the bat and showing the complete weakness of it.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.720]   It's hilarious.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.240]   It's the same thing that happened with impersonating Elon Musk.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:49.320]   It's just, you know, this is the problem is that people in the internet are very good at gaming.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.520]   Whatever you come up with, this killed dig.com.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.880]   Poor Kevin Rose was game data business.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.040]   Poor, I shouldn't say poor.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:03.480]   Yeah, but he was game data business because they couldn't figure out how to keep people from gaming it, gaming the system.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.880]   And in the intervening 10 years, we've got become masters.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.560]   You know, and you're playing 3D chess with somebody's playing 18 D chess.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.160]   Sorry.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:13.520]   Right.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:14.960]   So let's see.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:21.520]   Mike, so Donald J. Trump, you check the count name is real donuts Trump.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.080]   That's I decided to do my good friend, Elon, a favor and return.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.280]   How badly did you miss me?
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.200]   Oh, my God.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:29.720]   Right.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.000]   And there's another one goes on about where is it?
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.680]   Real donuts.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.600]   Look up the drew the onnie one.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.040]   Let's see.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.480]   A little or I think.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.400]   Do you think right there?
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.280]   Rodey Giuliani Esquire fake blue check though.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.200]   All talk takes it.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.400]   Fox, Nancy Pelosi and I do not agree on many things, but them things.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.560]   Thank you.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   I'll tell you what.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.760]   I stand with Kyrie Irving and Kanye West because George Soros once pushed me down the street
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:08.040]   and I was stuck on my back like a turtle for several minutes.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.480]   Says Rudy W.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.640]   This is really, really, really, really, really, really, really blue check.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:18.080]   I am hereby issuing a challenge to Alan Dershowitz street beefs.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.680]   Come get some dirt.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.560]   There can be only one dusty old pedophile attorney around these parts.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.200]   And on and on.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.880]   Helen Keller is a on.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:31.120]   I'm not going to read that one.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.840]   Nor will I read the one that says I will need to confirm it.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.120]   And I the reports that I made a big stinky doo do on Air Force one.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:42.360]   All I know is after Roger Stone used a bathroom would spell brassy in there.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:46.120]   Talk to me like a man with a mortgage.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.720]   I don't know what that is.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.240]   The language of the streets, but clearly Rudy is of the streets.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.320]   A fake.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.800]   So the moon actually verified claim the lake is.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.560]   Star was requesting a trade.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.080]   That can actually have damage financial damage to LeBron James.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.560]   Yeah. Yeah, you're good.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:11.520]   So this is why I want this value faster than cryptocurrency.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.160]   Yeah, it fell within hours to zero.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.120]   This is really why I want to get us off Twitter.
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.480]   I feel like it's turning into a hellscape.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.440]   Can he turn it around?
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   No.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.400]   But here's the irony.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.480]   If he listens to Jack, Jack, who paid him a billion dollars, who saved him a billion dollars by keeping his stock.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.640]   If he listens to Jack and federates Twitter through blue sky, through what activity pub, whatever.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.720]   And then there are new businesses that rise on top and then fine.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.680]   Whatever's left of Twitter, you can charge money for it.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.800]   What really matter you can have it.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:46.440]   You could not have it.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:51.480]   Well, I can tell you right now, if he uses activity pub to try to add it to the mastodon Federation, everybody's just going to block it.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.640]   I'm going to block it.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.720]   I mean, already you'll get blocked.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.800]   If you do too much cross posting, I can't imagine that being a.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.800]   Yeah, that's the problem is that it's not centralized.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:01.400]   You don't.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:07.520]   You can't come with a bag of money to you, you know, to go to Gargro and say, hey, let me in.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.040]   You can't.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.000]   It doesn't work that way.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.600]   I think a German would you agree?
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.520]   Follow German person.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.920]   Glenn, the EU, GEN is pronounced.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.360]   Eigen.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.920]   If you question or German, he's German.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.480]   He's German.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.360]   Like, Eigen, Eigen, Eigen, the rock.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.400]   I don't actually know.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.320]   So this is the must.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:26.880]   This is funny.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.200]   The I just the Mastodon fella.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.400]   Eigen, Gog, Eigen, Goglin.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.120]   What would it probably say?
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.640]   Well, Gargon is his is his online.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.680]   No, Gargron is his online name.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.600]   His real name.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.040]   Eigen, the whole is you.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.080]   I would say Eugene Rachko.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.240]   But that's a better name.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.840]   I would have said Eugene as well.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.200]   Eugene Rachko.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.000]   It's not spelled.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.160]   Yeah, unless he's added.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.360]   But notice the Cyrillic.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.040]   I think that he might he says he's German born,
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.120]   but I think his family might have been Russian.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.760]   So it says, I Guinea, Rachko.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:17:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.880]   And the in Cyrillic, it says,
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.400]   I Guinea, I Guinea, Rachko.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.480]   It's hard to say that.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.240]   Rachko Rachko Rachko Rachko.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.600]   Well, well, anyway, good interview with him.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.960]   In a time magazine.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.840]   Very interesting.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560]   I'll have to read that.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.560]   So, yeah, we'll have to get Mike on soon.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.280]   Do you agree with James Fallows?
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.360]   Jeff, Twitter is our future.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.320]   And he doesn't mean it in a good way.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.800]   It is in speed it up time lapse form
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.640]   what's happening to media in general.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.200]   Yeah, that was really interesting because what he did was he
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.080]   extrapolated back to media.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.400]   And I think he's right.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.320]   I think Jim Fallows is one of my heroes.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:39.640]   Love him.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.360]   He's a journalist.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.160]   He's great.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:41.720]   And it's sweet.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.520]   He's on jerna.host, by the way.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.440]   He did.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:44.760]   He did.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.520]   And what he's doing is he's saying through Twitter,
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.880]   we can see what media has happened.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.240]   And I agree with that because, you know, I've argued,
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.240]   and I got on this argument with somebody online on on Mastodon 2
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.240]   that it was James Click.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:01.840]   I got into it.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.840]   So that's the funny my best on is I'm already having wonderful
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.120]   cameras.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:04.560]   I know.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.240]   Look at it.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.080]   And look who's there.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:06.720]   James Click.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:07.400]   Come on.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.240]   So James Click and I, where he called and talked about surveillance
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.520]   capitalism and we're leaving that for.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.080]   And I said, I'm fine with everything you said.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.640]   He liked my post that I did.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.040]   So I said, I'm not really going to say, but I just hate that phrase.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.520]   It's really kept me, even though I'm now forcing myself to read the
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.760]   show.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.000]   Shana Subov said, oh, I'm more crazy with it.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.880]   Um, but, but I think it was Jim's, Jim's point about how we look back
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.560]   at the, uh, the economy of media and I talk about this all the time.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.960]   It's the attention economy that corrupted the internet that created
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:45.040]   the centralized internet of data and everything that, that, that Leo, you
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.880]   rail against, um, was, was, was media just, just imported.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.920]   And when we leave that on Twitter, we also leave that model on media.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.120]   And, and I think that, that we then have to figure out new models.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:00.000]   How do you support Adam Davidson and you on the Twitter server and that kind
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.960]   of stuff, it costs you money.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.200]   What are we going to do about that?
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.120]   How are we going to figure this out?
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.920]   It's a lot costs a lot less money.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.600]   Um, uh, but the creativity can be greater and can be on pixel
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.080]   fed sharing photos with us, figuring out other ways to do things.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.120]   There's wonderful new opportunities that did this before.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.680]   We can create all kinds of new services to, to, I was, what I went on
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:23.280]   about my post to recommend a Glenn Fleischman to you and to authenticate
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.040]   him and to find wonderful things that he says.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:30.640]   And, um, there's all kinds of new opportunities here, but it's not the old
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.400]   model, which there are you and I agree, Leo.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.040]   But it's not just Twitter that goes, it's media.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.640]   It's media.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.680]   Well, actually, as, as it swirls down the tubes, following it, uh, is, uh,
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.680]   social media, to be honest, as a category.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.880]   Can't say as a category.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.120]   I mean, look at Mastodon.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:53.960]   I mean, uh, uh, face meta and, uh, Twitter, uh, it's it, and
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.680]   Snapchat and what is arising is TikTok and YouTube is the content, uh,
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.880]   creators, which is media.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:01.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.440]   It's come around full circle.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.520]   Care for what you say.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.000]   How is it?
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.320]   So how is how so that's media, right?
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.520]   I mean, look, if you were looking at TikTok or watch, you're watching TV.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.240]   It's not a conversation.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:13.880]   You're watching TV.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.680]   It's a one-way street.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.480]   What's TikTok.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.720]   But Mastodon is a conversation.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:22.280]   No, no, I'm talking about a TikTok and YouTube, which can the rise of TikTok is
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.160]   the rise of media.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:29.240]   It's, but this rise of everybody media is the rise of the culture speaks for itself.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.840]   I would submit though that the problem here is going to be again, that all these
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.840]   creators are pouring all this effort into something that's owned by a monolith.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:41.680]   And you're going to have the same problem ultimately.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.200]   In fact, already, you know, with people like Paul Carr saying, well, China owns it.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.480]   So we shouldn't allow it.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:52.800]   Hank Green tried to start the creators, uh, union, basically.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.560]   Why don't creators do that?
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.920]   Stan, why don't they, he had to give up on it.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.720]   Uh, you know, Hank announced it in VidCon, uh, like five, six years ago.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.120]   Um, I joined it.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.120]   Uh, people joined it, but the problem was you couldn't get the big guys to negotiate
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.000]   with them because they didn't have the power.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.800]   And, um, uh, you know, I think you're still going to see, you're still going to see
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.120]   Hulu.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.720]   You're still going to see the big old guys, but I think that the TV, uh,
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.480]   linear TV is going away.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:25.840]   Uh, streaming is bigger now, uh, than both cable and TV, but YouTube is bigger than
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.320]   streaming when you really get down to it.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:32.320]   And, and I think that, uh, that what we're seeing is everyone able to create
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.080]   and collaborate together.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.840]   And we're still going to have, you know, Star Wars movies, we're still going to have
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.440]   that stuff.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:42.720]   We're still going to have blockbusters, but the risk factor to do it is going to go up immensely.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.360]   You've said this, that these, you know, even though it often has said, well,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.480]   you know, video killed, the radio star and radio killed newspapers and it, but
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.560]   nothing ever gets killed.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.160]   It just gets, it's, it's a marshmallow.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.520]   Pullman says that the new, the content of the new medium is the old medium.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:58.920]   Right.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.000]   And so wrappers.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:01.880]   Exactly.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.200]   I look at e-sports.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.720]   We're talking about the league of legends had its big worlds event in San
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.040]   Francisco last week at the Chase center where the Warriors play.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.040]   That keynote was unbelievable.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:12.400]   Fantastic.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.600]   Thousands of people.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.720]   They had little Nas X singing the theme song coming floating up in the hand of a
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.680]   mid giant Mac.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.640]   I mean, it was incredible.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:27.120]   Uh, and, and, and e-sports has, you know, in a way, it looks very much like the NFL or
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.960]   any sporting event.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.200]   You've got announcers who are very, very excited.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.480]   Seems like soccer to me.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.440]   It looks, yeah, worldwide reach.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.920]   It's very interesting.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.760]   Doesn't have that soccer does.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.680]   But it's still sports for pickleball, fella.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.360]   I know.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.600]   Take over the whole thing.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.000]   It's happening.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.640]   Uh, all right.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.120]   What else, what else is going on here?
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.360]   Starling.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.160]   As long as we're piling on, I was going to ask you something.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.640]   Um, dang it.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.680]   Well, you think about it while I mentioned this is a brief story.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.600]   Uh, Starlink.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.160]   I'm not really having second thoughts about Starlink now.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:08.400]   At first, I was not because of Elon.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.680]   I was first, I was very excited.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:15.680]   I was very excited about the idea of a global internet every corner of the earth
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.960]   with access.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.520]   And then it turns out, and, and, and for that, I was, I, I personally said, you know,
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:21.680]   what?
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:22.440]   Okay.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.440]   It's not great to have 50,000 satellites blocking astronomers, but
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.760]   hey, it's a fair trade because everybody's getting access to the internet.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.680]   Well, it turns out it's not going to be everybody gets access to the internet.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.640]   It's anybody could pay enough for it.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:42.400]   And even then now, SpaceX is adding a fair use restrictions, just like
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.280]   a Hughes had where you, if you use more than a terabyte a month, which isn't very
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.840]   much, I use more like four terabytes a month, because of all the streaming I do.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.080]   If you use a more than a terabyte, they're going to slow you down during the
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:56.600]   last hour.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.000]   So it's 120 bucks.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:58.720]   Seven to 11.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.200]   It's, it's now raised.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.200]   They've raised the price from 99 to, I think, 128, maybe it's a hundred
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.000]   ten bucks a month.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.400]   It's a hundred ten bucks a month.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:08.280]   It costs you 500 bucks a month for the equipment.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.800]   This is a rich person's internet.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.480]   This is an internet for all.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.280]   No.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.400]   And the price we're paying is the sky is now filled with Elon satellites.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.000]   Totally screw it up my Astro.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.520]   I, I've actually completely changed my tune on this thing.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.280]   It's very disappointing.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.680]   Of course, unfortunately, it's too late.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.200]   Is it sustainable or all these are just going to decay back into orbit?
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.000]   And I guess eventually they will.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:37.000]   He's probably going to charge $8 per megabyte or something.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.440]   Well, in fact, I saw, I didn't know as I saw the head of the FCC at an event.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.120]   It was off the record.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.000]   I'm supposed to say this, but it was a big event.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.040]   And she was talking, she says nothing.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.760]   That's not going to be public.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.440]   She was talking about the requirements.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.880]   Now I think after a satellite goes out of service, it can stay up there like 50
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.760]   years and they're going to reduce that to like five.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.080]   Oh, they're going to force garbage cars.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:55.320]   You.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.360]   They have to.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.160]   It's just there's too much crap up there.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.200]   So do you actually, when you're taking the threshold, say, what was the threshold
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.040]   for you because $120 is, yeah, that's a lot of money.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.960]   What, what should that line be?
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:17.320]   Well, I don't mind if he charges for all us wealthy Americans a lot in order to
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.800]   provide access in Africa for a buck a month, right?
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.920]   But he's not going to have us to subsidize it basically.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:25.920]   Yeah, but he's not doing that.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:26.520]   He's not doing that.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.320]   Even even this, even this lights, even the terminals he put in Ukraine.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.280]   Now he's threatening to turn off if the Pentagon doesn't pay.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:41.040]   And in fact, a whole bunch of them were turned off for the Ukrainian military.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.200]   So Elon said power that is into his hands and he's Putin's buddy.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.960]   He had said on Twitter, Oh, never mind.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:49.640]   I'll pay first.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.240]   He says, Oh, I want the Pentagon to pay for it.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.560]   Then he said, Oh, never mind.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:59.280]   But then shortly after that, a whole swath of it was turned off, you know, just
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.560]   randomly, apparently.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:08.360]   So I think unfortunately we've given a mad man, the right to put 50,000, whatever
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.240]   it is, 78,000.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.840]   So when you when you you saying it's affecting your astrophotography, do you see
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.000]   him?
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:19.000]   Yeah, you can see him in certain areas, especially the longer you hold that
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.720]   shutter open, you'll see things sort of moving across the sky.
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.440]   And like, Oh, that's not a star.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:28.840]   So I mean, I mentioned this before the show, Leo, but but but at the press
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.520]   conference with Biden, reporter asked him, I'm just doing it again.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.960]   Now on the air, do you think Elon Musk is a threat to national security?
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.320]   And Biden said, and I quote, I think that Elon Musk cooperation and or
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.720]   technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.680]   And they kind of try to ask him to say more, he said, that's what I'm going to
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:45.880]   say.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.800]   Right.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.000]   Those were kids.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.640]   He was like, how, how are you going to look at it?
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.560]   He said, there are many ways.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.320]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.560]   It's here's the problem.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.920]   He's got business in China.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.520]   China, not only manufacturers, Tesla's, including Tesla's purchased in the US,
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.400]   but Apple has business in China too, right?
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.080]   And China's a big market for both Apple and Tesla.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.680]   I think it's fair to question Apple related to China.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:14.400]   I think we do.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.400]   Questioning of, yeah, I think it's more there has been more questioning too, is
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.680]   I think when, you know, Apple, I think put too many eggs in its Chinese basket.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.800]   And I know it wanted the revenue there, but and I wanted to reduce costs.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.880]   But, you know, they're already seeing what the, the COVID shutdowns and everything.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:36.520]   And the eventually the G is going to try to make everything internal and for
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.280]   internal markets.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.480]   And I think Apple's going to be absolutely pressed to do things I doesn't want to.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.960]   And it may make more compromises than it has.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.520]   But the difference is Apple doesn't have owned the world's town square.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.680]   No, there were concerns.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.560]   Remember that it was a bunch of issues like Elon's taking this over just before
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.840]   the midterms and it's a result in misinformation and disinformation.
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.000]   So fortunately you feel like he's the Occam's razor would suggest that
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.680]   Elon wanted to disrupt Republicans ability the right, the right wing to message
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.640]   because he made the service so unusable before midterms.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:10.400]   I don't think it's a minor or a minor or a minor Republicans.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.040]   Yeah, I don't I didn't see any huge stories erupt in the last few days over
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.200]   Twitter, which is what's happened in previous cycles.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.920]   You know, Leo, I was at the same conference.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.200]   I had a conversation with with executives from different sectors.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:29.760]   And it was a fascinating conversation about de-globalization that the pressure
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:36.840]   now on companies to unconnect with China, disconnect with China is huge.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.080]   And elsewhere around the world and it starts to be really interesting.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.400]   And what happens here is how do we then shift around these companies,
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.480]   you know, from from building supplies companies to electronics companies to
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:52.120]   magazine companies have huge relationships with China.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:57.880]   And if now that becomes not de-rigure anymore and not their growth anymore,
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.520]   it affects a lot of businesses.
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.520]   It's going to be interesting to watch.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.800]   Let's not forget it.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.880]   Stephen, Elon also controls a big part of the US space effort.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:15.800]   Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's we've given we've allowed him to be I mean,
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.800]   this is the thing that's come up a lot.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:22.640]   I think after he finished the Close Action of Twitter is a lot of people
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.440]   independently keep pointing out that Elon's success comes from being in the
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.520]   right place at the right time, which is true, and massive government subsidies.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.400]   And I've kept joking on Twitter, of course.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.720]   That if the Elon just needs to figure out how to get the government to pay the
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.280]   eight dollars a month for verification for users, and then it'll be fine.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.960]   Because that's the model he's done with everything else.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:45.480]   So he's got to I mean, SpaceX could be taken over.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:48.640]   He, you know, the ultimate outcome, I was saying for a long time,
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.960]   I didn't think Elon would close in this because I thought he would wind up
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.160]   preferring to take a billion dollar, two billion dollar penalty and walk away.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.520]   And why is he sensible could have seen this coming?
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:02.520]   And focus on it because he's clearly reduced the value of Tesla by hundreds of
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.880]   billions or all of his companies combined by hundreds of billions of dollars,
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.080]   put himself personally on the hook.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.880]   And so I didn't think he would really do it in the end.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:13.960]   And so watching him do this, I'm thinking, God, is he going to lose control of Tesla?
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.400]   Is he going to lose control of?
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.560]   I don't think he has the same, I looked this up at some point.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.000]   I don't think he has the same.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.800]   It's not a Tesla's stock structure.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:26.480]   It does not have the same kind of voting rate situation as a lot of tech companies
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.120]   do and Facebook and so forth.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:31.280]   So there is the potential that even though he owns a lot of the company,
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.520]   he owns 14% of it.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:38.040]   He sold 4 billion bucks, so he's got 14% same as the institutional and public owns all the rest.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:38.960]   Right.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:42.800]   So doesn't he, so he has disproportionate voting rights, but if he gets pushed on,
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.680]   I mean, I think Zuckerberg's got meta structure that it's essentially effectively
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.240]   impossible for him to ever lose voting.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.480]   It's all supersures.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:56.680]   But Musk could conceivably have to be forced by margin calls and
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.240]   loan conditions to sell off enough of Tesla.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.360]   If Tesla's stock keeps dropping in price.
[01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:05.840]   And Twitter's valuation is, you know, substantially below even what he offered,
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.200]   but it's far below probably what it was two weeks ago.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.560]   There's going to be a point in which he could lose control of Tesla,
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.040]   lose control of SpaceX, he'd be forced to spin stuff off.
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.160]   He could be forced out of multiple companies.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.880]   And then you say, you know, maybe SpaceX will continue with different ownership
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:22.400]   for different, you know, different, someone will buy him out.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.480]   Jeff Bezos will come and buy his rival.
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.640]   So let's go through these scenarios for a second, if we would.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.600]   There's a Twitter scenario.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.720]   There's Twitter and Tesla scenario.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.640]   Twitter scenario is the company can just go bankrupt.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:37.640]   It can end up being owned primarily by Saudi princes and such.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:42.840]   One scenario says that Tesla would buy it because it reduces their
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.800]   exposure to Twitter stock.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.160]   Another is that Twitter, the Tesla gets rid of Musk.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.560]   So that's your problem, bud.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.920]   Right.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.280]   What where is Twitter is going to implode?
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:56.800]   There's no question.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.720]   There's no business here.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:02.520]   He can't afford the billion dollars in carrying costs.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.760]   He's destroyed the business.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:06.640]   It's going to explode.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.480]   You already talked about the technology view of that, but from the financial
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.000]   it's going to.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:11.800]   So what are the scenario?
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.880]   What's the what's the what's the end of this?
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:14.920]   Where does the story go?
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:15.520]   Where does it end?
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.480]   I mean, you know, it'd be great to see if the world's richest man face
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:23.160]   and come up in this, but I don't know if we'll actually we'll actually see that.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.240]   Sometimes he might be too big to fail, you know.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:31.920]   As as thinking around here, Musk's a must have just sold must just sold four
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.240]   billion dollars for the Tesla stock.
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.280]   The other day, he said he would not sell anymore.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:35.680]   He did.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.240]   So that was complicated, but he's got he does a disproportionate ownership
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.160]   and also insiders.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:46.000]   So the argument was that not that he has majority voting share voting rights,
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.800]   but it's that it would require a super majority of everybody else at this point
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.600]   to have enough voting shares to override him.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:58.240]   However, his ownership could become diluted and banks can make calls.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.520]   There's just all these things that can happen that can reduce his ownership.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:04.000]   Steak and thus his voting rights and thus put him in that position.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.120]   But you know, I don't know.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.160]   I mean, the guy's going to have Billy.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:09.080]   This is like, remember when we work collapse and you're like, well, I feel
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.160]   bad for poor Adam.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.080]   Yeah, no, he did fine.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.920]   What do you want to put the billion dollars or bank?
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.760]   Sam, Sam Freeman is the same thing.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.520]   You know, he's got to go walk away for.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.440]   He's only got 800 million.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.040]   Oh, I shot.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.040]   94 billion dollars.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:21.520]   That's fine.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:21.880]   Right.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.160]   No, no, I'm on the tip.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.760]   That Adam guy is getting more funding for other people.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.200]   All of his failures.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.120]   That's kind of what I mean by too big to fail.
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:32.400]   It's all like it's a good old boys network and you fail upwards.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.720]   Fail on space eventually.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.680]   Fly to Mars and your failures.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.400]   Actually, a couple of things apparently may be influenced by Jack Dorsey
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:47.080]   Elon's considering he has apparently applied to his entered filed paperwork
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.520]   to enter the payments business according to the New York Times.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.240]   Does that compete with Jack Leo?
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.240]   I would bet Jack's a partner in this in some way, but I don't know.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:00.200]   OK, I'm not thinking is if you're going to make the X app, the everything app,
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.320]   you got to have payments, right?
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.640]   That's and that's one of his plans.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.360]   They were just fighting.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.640]   You were just fighting on Twitter.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.520]   Jack and Jack and
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.520]   Elon were having a fight.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.320]   Oh, good.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.960]   Because Elon was on spaces this morning.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:20.360]   He spent an hour talking about his plans for the social media service,
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.280]   positioning it as a competitor to more than just classic social networks.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.840]   Like Facebook, he says, Twitter will make money from content creators
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:33.880]   and delve deeper into video business segments that TikTok is mastered.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:35.280]   He just I'm reading from the New York Times.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:38.200]   He discussed a vision for Twitter because I did not listen.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.800]   Well, couldn't he discussed a vision for Twitter to process payments,
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.960]   complete with connected debit cards and bank accounts.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:49.920]   Remember, he that's how he started with an online bank called
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:51.760]   X.com, which he sold to PayPal.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:57.480]   He said he hopes to transfer into the everything app model after we chat.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:05.040]   Yeah, I think honestly, though, this feels like a lot like, you know,
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:10.400]   he's going, he's running around trying to put out the fire and throwing spaghetti.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.160]   The rate of evolution of Twitter, this is a quote, will be an immense step
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:18.000]   change compared to what it has been in the past.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.640]   You know, if nothing else, I am a technologist and I can make technology go fast.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.640]   And that's what you'll see happen at Twitter.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.560]   He sounds a lot like Donald Trump in his in his late years.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.120]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.640]   Absolutely.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:33.680]   So I think that and go fast.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.680]   Yeah. And yeah.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:40.440]   So that Lopez, which is Lopez Lynette on Twitter said she she covered.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.440]   She's a columnist on Business Insider.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.920]   And she said she covered him for three years investigating him.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:52.760]   And it's a it's a it's a quite a litany of his failures.
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.480]   He put batteries with potential defect of cooling systems in people's cars and they
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.480]   knew about it.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:02.440]   He told reporters, he told engineers to stop doing break tests because they were
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.240]   fighting too many defects and on and on and on and on.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.480]   He he didn't start Tesla, right?
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.120]   He came in and invested in it because he had the money from the previous company.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.240]   I worked with his old yellow pages company way back when
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.280]   I was in a newspaper.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.560]   You know, he took that money and he turned it around and he turned it around.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:24.120]   But he keeps saying he's going to find the right people.
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.520]   He's going to he's going to trust the right people.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.760]   And I think he did that a SpaceX.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.440]   That's what it said at Tesla.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.120]   But I think that that's limited given this kind of stuff that this reporter has.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:39.880]   That team is landing Daggum rocket boosters and we still can't parallel park.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.880]   You did something.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.560]   You're right.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.280]   You're right.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:42.960]   You're right.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:46.880]   Let me let me let me propose a counter example.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.520]   So let's say he gets payments working.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:53.240]   He's giving people who pay eight bucks the right to post longer videos.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.240]   He says, first 10 minutes and 42 minutes eventually hours long.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:02.360]   What if he goes to people like Marquez Brownlee and says, look, I've got a system
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.240]   for you to monetize on Twitter.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.640]   You've already got a vast audience and turns Twitter into a place where creators
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.200]   can post videos, make money, so they put more videos there.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:18.640]   I feel like this has been tried many, many times.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.480]   They've been burned by so many people.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.640]   They've been burned by Facebook, Periscope.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.160]   I'm pretty sure MKVHD will say, show me the data.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:33.680]   Well, they're creators out there who maybe young and up and coming creators who will
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:34.880]   say, well, how much?
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:38.240]   And Elon says, look, I'm going to guarantee you 50% of everything.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.320]   Maybe let's make 70% of everything we make.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:45.080]   And in return, we'll host it and you've got your following already on Twitter.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.160]   This is where he's really got to stop the bleeding.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.520]   You've got your following already on Twitter.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.080]   So, you know, he could let's say he comes to me and says, look, you got a half
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.320]   million followers on Twitter.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.160]   Why don't you post your videos there?
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.360]   We'll sell ads into it.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.240]   We'll share the revenue with you 50 50.
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:03.160]   What do you say?
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:06.640]   Well, I'm the wrong person asked.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.520]   What let's say it says, said, is Lisa.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:14.160]   She's like, yes, go back in.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.000]   I actually would like to hear her answer.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.640]   Lisa, what would you say around?
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.200]   I don't know.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.720]   She she may be on a call by now, but if she's listening, she'll come running.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.680]   She's got work to do.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.640]   I like the rest of the rest of the rest of the day.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.080]   Basically, her job is to try to make the gland you went
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.400]   supposed to say that out loud.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.200]   Yes.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:33.120]   For hours and hours.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:33.840]   Poor woman.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.800]   I swear to God.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.320]   I'm just paraphrasing Leo.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.040]   Mark has wanted more creator tools on Twitter.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.200]   The ability to get paid from their subscribers and so forth.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:46.000]   So he talks about this on a video, apparently.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.040]   Did you read doing our chat room is saying I haven't seen that yet.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:53.920]   I feel like it's it's conceivable.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.080]   He's going to have to scramble.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.640]   He's going to have to make it happen fast.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.000]   But before everybody leaves, if he can just say, wait, wait, wait,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.520]   this is going to be, you know, watch this.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.320]   And there's some great stuff happening.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:09.000]   Feel like though, Vine, of course, not Vine, Phil, because the creators
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.480]   came to Twitter and said, you've got to give us a share.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.320]   The Twitter says, no, no, we're too big.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.520]   Share what we don't have a share.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:19.600]   No, but the thing is you just said before everybody leaves, not
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:20.560]   everybody's going to leave.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.440]   Mark has Brown leaves, probably not leaving Twitter.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:30.840]   He could still have his huge YouTube presence and just have a Twitter supplement.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:34.480]   He'd have to he'd have to get a better deal, though, than YouTube's giving him, right?
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.360]   Right. I mean, I'm not saying he's going to upload his videos to Twitter,
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:43.720]   but he could still use that feed as a way to say, well, no, but Elon
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:46.920]   wants the video there because he wants people to go to Twitter to watch it
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.640]   so they can monetize them.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.080]   And then the proposition is we're going to somehow.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.000]   That's what TikTok says.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:53.920]   That's what YouTube says.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.920]   Well, go back to Buzzfeed.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.240]   We're going to start with that whole studio.
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.160]   Yeah. Go to case.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.760]   But in case he nice that where did he go?
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.680]   He went for a while and didn't really work out.
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:01.920]   He's going to send YouTube.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.920]   Yeah, but he's back to YouTube.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.280]   Right. There have been these stories before.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.040]   It's conceivable.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.640]   There's there's I feel like there.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.680]   I don't want to write off.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:13.880]   It's not impossible that he could find a path to success.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:20.800]   It's it's unlikely, probably, but it's going to require discipline on his part
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.240]   and and some and some real execution, neither of which he's shown.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.200]   I'd say it's like the chances of Sarah Palin becoming president.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.600]   Don't know.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:30.360]   It could happen.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.240]   But Sarah Huckabee is another governor of Arkansas.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:38.120]   So, you know, never say never.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.200]   Yeah, I know.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.600]   I know we've been there.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.840]   I don't know.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.160]   I know.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.120]   It's really interesting.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.760]   I don't want to write him off.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.160]   I want to I want to envision some sort of scenario where he could pull it off.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.360]   But it's a it's a long shot.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.400]   It really is a long shot.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.960]   Well, it's mainly because he's such a loose cannon.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:54.760]   It would mark us trust him.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.080]   Whatever the deal is, whatever the contract is,
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.760]   yeah, I wouldn't trust him.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.480]   Well, the one thing is that you want a legal system that apparently must,
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.000]   even if he doesn't like it, he has been forced to go through both through the
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.720]   Chance Record of Delaware and that suit about the Pito comment where he prevailed
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.240]   for technical reasons, but he still he had to sit there and tell you know, he was
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:19.160]   forced to go to trial.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.320]   He couldn't just walk away from it.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.080]   And so if you send a contract with him, he may try to not honor it.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.960]   But in the end, it sounds like you could get more than he agreed to pay you
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.720]   because you'll win in court.
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.760]   If you're lucky, if you're lucky, if you're willing to put that money out there.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.920]   But the question is, does anybody trust him?
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:38.960]   Plus, when I had a bad contractor and we screwed up on our house and all that,
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.560]   but I didn't realize he said, I'm judgment proof.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:42.360]   I don't have anything.
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:42.680]   Right.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:43.120]   Fine.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.440]   So me, I got nothing.
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:44.760]   Right.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.160]   License bonded insured.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.040]   That's the important part.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.200]   Well, I learned that the other way.
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.320]   We, we, we can't have a move checkmark of schmuck right on my.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.640]   We have that we have that on a sign in our house.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.640]   Just we have a virtual sign after that.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.440]   I want, I want Elon Musk.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.000]   I want to be licensed bonded insured.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:03.640]   Ever trust him.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.160]   I don't know.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.920]   Who would, who would ensure Elon Musk?
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.360]   Huh?
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.760]   All right.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.320]   Let's take a break.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:08.720]   Come back.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.880]   We got more to talk about with our great panel, Glenn Fleischman.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:13.560]   Glenn dot fun.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.160]   When do you want to plug plug something?
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.280]   Oh, what do I got going on?
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.400]   Hey, I'm going to talk about flong.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.720]   But the show will come right after it.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.640]   Uh, we're going to do a special tomorrow.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.040]   You're going to talk about flong, right?
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.480]   I'm talking about flong tomorrow, but I have a other day.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.120]   I'll plug something slightly obscure.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.440]   You're in the Columbus, Ohio area for the next seven months.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:37.560]   Go to Ohio, the Ohio State University, remember the V, the Billy
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:40.000]   Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.760]   They have an exhibition that opens this Saturday of the bill, the
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.160]   Bill Blackbird collection, Bill collected East passed away a number of years ago,
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.080]   but Bill spent decades collecting what they call an ex-librisp, but
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.080]   deaccessioned newspapers and other material from libraries, clipped
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:03.280]   the comics out or comics pages and saved comics history for daily cartoons.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.040]   He has some of the, he collected some of the only copies of these comics because
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.560]   material was lost at syndicates or was never properly catalogued.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.480]   And six tractor trailer loads of it were bought by the Billy Ireland
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.920]   library and passed out there.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:20.240]   Eight, what six tractor trailers and tracked out there 25 years ago.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:23.800]   They've been cataloging ever since they get grants at different times in the
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.160]   middle of a grant to do a lot of work.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:30.640]   I was just out there in Ohio and a beautiful fall week, a few weeks ago to
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.200]   chat with the creators and I have a video about the history of comics
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.920]   indication, how it actually worked in the days of metal type and printing will be
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:44.120]   running continuously in this exhibition that opens up.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.480]   So if you're in Columbus, stop by.
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.160]   Well, that video will be online, Mr.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:49.680]   Fleischman.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680]   It will.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.640]   I'm holding it back.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.280]   It's an exclusive until the exhibition opens and I'll post it online.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.720]   But you'll, you'll see the Rube Goldberg like steps that people used to go
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:03.200]   through when a cartoonist would draw something on a board, the eight layers of
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.920]   processing that went from there to an appearing in a newspaper.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:09.560]   It's kind of outrageous that it was economically feasible.
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.320]   Will you post it at Glendot fun?
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.240]   I certainly will post links there.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:16.720]   You see, I've already updated it for Mastodile.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.920]   Look at that.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:18.400]   Look at that.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.080]   We were here.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:19.920]   You rock.
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.640]   You get it.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640]   You get it.
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.360]   There we go.
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:25.920]   Little, you put it on my YouTube.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.960]   There he is.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:27.800]   That's my personal blog.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.640]   There he is.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.440]   Comics, gasoline, Ali.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.440]   Little 1940s gasoline alley action there in the header.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.080]   I used to read that when I was a kid.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:36.200]   It's still running.
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.480]   It's, it's been running.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.720]   I don't know what they're doing now.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.240]   Skisics is 105.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:40.480]   I don't know.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.600]   Skisics, that's right.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:47.280]   I did observe though, even as a child that the Sunday funnings were rarely funny.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:49.680]   Yeah, that is a problem.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.400]   I was reading it.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:55.680]   I was looking at when I was at the museum, they pulled a bunch of material
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.400]   pull from the archives looking at primary sources and found some interesting things.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.920]   One of them was old crazy cat comics and crazy cat.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:02.400]   Wow.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.520]   You know, George Harriman, that was a pretty surreal thing for the 1920s.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.120]   And he would throw a great comic.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.880]   Yeah, throw a Ignat's mouse, which one to use is Ignat's mouse.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:15.640]   And I also had to pull a bunch of Barney Google because they had a big collection of Barney
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.880]   Google and Snuffy Smith.
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:20.240]   And I was trying to, I was looking at stuff visually.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:23.720]   I was looking at the reproduction issues, but I wound up reading huge amounts of it.
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:25.080]   And boy, is it weird?
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.040]   It was weird.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:33.960]   Sexist, ethnic, slurry, just like you're like the stuff that they were doing from the 1920s
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:37.480]   to like the 1950s was, it was hard stuff.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:40.840]   Occasionally funny, Popeye, the old Popeye stuff was really weird.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.240]   He doesn't even show up.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.960]   Popeye doesn't show up in the strip for a while.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:44.400]   Really?
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.880]   That's called a thimble time theater, I think, or something like that until he he shows up
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:50.880]   and takes over.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:57.720]   Anyway, it's the old comics are a very weird thing produced by a cadre of oddballs
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:00.440]   who, but people read them like crazy.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:03.800]   People bought, you know, they would, they had, if you search online, you're looking
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.600]   for things like, you know, weirdly like me for Snuffy Smith or something or Barney
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.440]   Google and you'll find there were stage plays all across the country based on
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.600]   comic strips across the 1910s to 1940s.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.640]   Very, very common.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.800]   So, you know, Annie and things like that were not new.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.680]   Those were extremely popular stage shows.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.280]   This is so surreal.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:24.640]   I'm reading this, I guess, a Sunday.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:28.320]   It's, it looks like a full page color crazy cat.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.520]   Oh my God.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.240]   Uh, in which he and Ignat's mouse are traveling around with a door.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:38.760]   He says, a door is so useless without a house is hitched to it.
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.320]   It has no, I don't know how to read that word.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.640]   Intrinsic value.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.880]   It looks like the, it's, I don't know what he's saying.
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.840]   It lacks, he has a strange dialect, right?
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:55.000]   It lacks like the Wabra, Robra, Essentials of Hada Bliv.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.880]   And this historically it is all wrong and misleading.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:59.960]   You got to be on drugs, but they weren't.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.600]   It's 1940s.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.400]   It's a thing of beauty.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.080]   It fails in every respect.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:10.160]   The best thing you could say about it is when is a door, not a door.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.200]   And the answer is when it's a jug, which is all a joke.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:15.960]   God, like what?
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.480]   And people love people.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.000]   Eight this up and same funny.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]   Hey, crazy cat.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.080]   You love a crazy cat, famously gender fluid.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.160]   If you read the strips, he's got his varying gender identities.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.960]   And the character herself, themselves, and the George Herman was probably
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.280]   secretly African American.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.800]   Now, I know that sounds funny, but in the days he had to, well,
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:40.040]   it doesn't sound funny.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:40.560]   Secretly.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.720]   It doesn't sound perfect since.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.560]   He wanted to work and there were not, there were some African American
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.400]   characters working.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.200]   He had to be a black paper.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.240]   Black newspaper, not in a white newspaper.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.960]   Well, I mean, there were a handful of people, but it sounds like he
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:56.920]   tried to hide his identity.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.200]   Wow.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:57.800]   There's some.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.640]   So we don't know family stuff, but yeah, I don't think it's still,
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:01.720]   there's still a total clarity.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:02.840]   People have traced his family trees.
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.240]   A lot of books about him because, you know, crazy cat ran for a few decades.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.480]   This is my dad's favorite.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.080]   Everything.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:11.240]   I have to have his influential and all the surreal comics that followed.
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.440]   So you read that one.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:13.760]   You're like, how did this run?
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:14.880]   Children are reading this?
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.720]   What were, what were comics like?
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:19.480]   And this was an example of it that people really loved.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.440]   It sold newspapers.
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:26.800]   It's no sign because you're a dorm mice that you got a hall, a door around with you.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.320]   You never see Mr.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.280]   Steve door or Mr.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.240]   Torador or Mr.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.920]   Husper door doing it, do you?
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.040]   No, sir.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.680]   They got better sense.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:40.800]   Can you imagine my little friend Ignat's mice?
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.240]   Bottling himself with a door.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.720]   Ha, not he.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:45.400]   He's smart.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:46.000]   He is.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.600]   Boom, gets hit with a brick.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:49.280]   Goodbye.
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.880]   Goodbye.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:54.760]   And if you assist on carrying a door, take my advice and get a screen door.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.520]   It's more sanitary and more light with weight.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.040]   So it's so much.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.080]   It's a rush, brothers.
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:02.160]   I mean, the Marx brothers were pretty.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:02.760]   That's true.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.960]   And yeah, these are not too far apart.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.440]   So I guess she didn't need drugs.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.200]   Uh, they just, they would just were stony.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.120]   Oh, opium was just available.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:12.840]   The drugstore.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.200]   You didn't need to search for it.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.520]   They're all hot up on Coca-Cola.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:21.280]   Sir, actually, that's how I do this show.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:28.440]   Um, also, Jeff Jarvis, tell us what you've got working on these days.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:34.160]   Hopped up on Gutenberg, bite dot l y slash by Gutenberg.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:39.120]   I buy my little publishers marketplace notice whether today way late, but it's fine.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.000]   I want to always wonder one of these.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:41.680]   What does that mean?
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:42.720]   To book deal.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:48.200]   Uh, my Gutenberg book and my magazine book and a two book deal to, uh, it's in my, um,
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.200]   to Twitter, if you go to my, my, my, uh,
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.680]   Mastodon.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.280]   Yes.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.240]   I can.
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.880]   And, uh, you are a master.
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.760]   Very, uh, through my agent.
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:00.880]   So officially my deal was announced today.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:03.520]   That is one disadvantage of not having a central place.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.800]   I can't go to mastodon.com/jefjervis.
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:07.360]   You can.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:10.400]   And find us on on social.com/jefjervis.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:13.480]   Uh, if I knew that that's where you were, right.
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.120]   Exactly.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.920]   But I've been your feed, aren't I?
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:16.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.120]   To search for me.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:20.040]   So, and then I can also on the right.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:23.640]   See, I found your profile and then I can scroll through your, your,
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:27.200]   let's say, uh, very reasonably priced book you wrote, Jeff.
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:30.040]   Sometimes hard covers these days are like $80.
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:30.720]   So how much is it?
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.000]   Gutenberg parenthesis.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000]   27, but you can get it.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.200]   $20 for a book.
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.080]   But you can get it if you preorder now, you can get a
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:41.000]   product as you need the hard cover edition of this.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.080]   Clearly do.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:45.600]   This will be something suitable for framing.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.040]   Put it up on the wall.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.400]   Do you like the cover?
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.200]   I do.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:51.040]   This was your final choice was this.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:51.480]   I like it.
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:51.920]   I don't trust this.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:52.960]   I think you chose a good one.
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:53.800]   And you had you had.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:54.040]   You had.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.080]   Did you like this one?
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:56.320]   Yes, I do.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.320]   Good.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.040]   It's nice.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:01.720]   Cause on the left, you have the old, you know, black letter from, you know,
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:05.160]   Gutenberg Bible and on the right, you have a, you know, CSS
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.640]   and HTML from a man.
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:09.040]   I had Jake look at it to make sure it wasn't something so
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.200]   stupid in code.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:11.960]   They're there.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:13.200]   Oh, no Easter egg.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:17.160]   Jeff, I got to tell you, I would have booked an Adobe go live with
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:19.480]   my friend Jeff Carlson back 20 years ago.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.880]   And I think the second edition of the book, we get the cover from the cover
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.480]   proof before he goes to press from the publisher.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:29.200]   And we look at it and the cover is HTML and it's all from front page.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.640]   If you remember Microsoft front page, yeah.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:31.800]   I would front page.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.680]   The word front page is all over it.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.240]   Oh, God.
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:36.520]   You can't think about it.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.280]   You can't do this.
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:38.640]   Unfortunately, we caught it in time.
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:41.320]   I think this is pretty safe.
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:45.600]   There's a lot of floor and ripple and document and live document and
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:46.200]   remove.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:48.640]   And I, I wonder where they got it, actually.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.840]   I might look like, I don't know what they've got from.
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:53.680]   Yeah, probably their own web page or something.
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:56.680]   And so, and Mr. Glenn Fleischman has been giving me advice about the
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:59.040]   books, the body type fonts.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:03.680]   Cause we both love the story of the dubs Bible font and Glenn is
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:04.520]   on far more.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.480]   He's written about it.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.080]   Is this in the dubs Bible font?
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.080]   I think that'd be great.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:10.040]   There's no italic in it.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:12.320]   You can't really do that, but I would love.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:13.920]   She's doing black and black leggings.
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.200]   This is the whole thing in black leggings.
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.560]   We will read.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.720]   And Pruitt hands on photography.
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:27.000]   Twit.tv/hop and aproot.com/prints if you'd like to buy his
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.320]   beautiful photographic prints.
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.720]   Who's on hop this week?
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:33.640]   Well, on the hop this week, I'm actually looking at him.
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:36.560]   A particular product because people have been asking about a
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:41.240]   product for some of their workflow and the company was able to lend
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:43.840]   me said product and let me spend some time with it.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.000]   I'm going to share my thoughts.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.640]   But yeah, and pro.com/prints.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.960]   That's one of those prints.
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.400]   See, that's the astro you were talking about.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.680]   How did you do that?
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.640]   Any of those Elon's birds up there?
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:01.640]   I, I, I, I brushed those out because I did get the little streaks.
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:02.400]   Did you really?
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:03.720]   You did.
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:04.120]   Holy cow.
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:05.200]   How annoying is that?
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:07.800]   I take back everything I said.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:08.800]   Unfortunately, it's too late.
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:09.760]   The FCC approved it.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:10.720]   What's the total?
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:15.360]   I think they want 70,000 Starlink satellites and then Amazon wants to do the same thing.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.640]   Wow.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.840]   But again, it initially is for the greater good, right?
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:20.800]   Well, that's what I thought.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.680]   But I don't, I think now it's for the greater enrichment of Mr.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:24.640]   Elon T.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:25.080]   Musk.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:28.280]   What, what the Google or Facebook plans have been better?
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:29.000]   The balloons or the balloons.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.240]   Or the balloons.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.800]   And I don't know.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:37.400]   I mean, look, we getting internet access to everybody is, is a high priority now.
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:41.280]   But, you haven't come up with a good one of those things.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:42.840]   I don't think should be a luxury.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.440]   Right.
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.600]   You know, I agree.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:45.240]   I agree.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:48.760]   Our show today brought to you by CashFly.
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:51.440]   Yes, literally brought to you by CashFly.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:53.920]   It's our content delivery network.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.640]   And it has been for more than a decade.

[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:17.640]   And it could do the same for your content, bring it to your customers.
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:19.480]   And let me tell you something.
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:25.680]   If you want to do video, CashFly's new ultra low latency video streaming is amazing.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.320]   I'm not talking about that unreliable web RTC solution you might have been using.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:37.720]   It's WebSocket live video scalable to millions of users with sub one second latency.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:39.440]   That's amazing.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.760]   That's better than broadcast.
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.760]   You can go live in hours.
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:46.480]   You're reaching your audience anywhere in the world.
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:50.000]   Oh, and check out CashFly's storage optimization system.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:50.640]   We use this.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:53.400]   It eliminates cash misses.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:55.280]   You get a hundred percent cash hit ratio.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:00.760]   And reduces the bandwidth because you don't have to go out and get stuff from your origin server.
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.680]   It's sitting on CashFly.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:05.680]   So you'll take a load off your origin servers, reduce your S3 bills.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:07.160]   It is incredible.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:13.440]   And I do want to recommend something we also have, which is CashFly's elite managed packages, VIP treatment.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:19.440]   I mean, honestly, nobody's got time to manage your, you know, your servers.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.120]   Let CashFly do it with 24/7 support.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:27.840]   Response times in less than an hour, in most cases, they already know if there's a problem
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:30.720]   and they'll be working to fix it, maybe even before you even notice.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:34.440]   And I have to say, maybe that's happened because we've never had a problem with CashFly.
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.520]   Look at the big brands that use CashFly.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:37.280]   It's not just us.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:38.960]   So what do you get?
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.920]   Ultra low latency video streaming check to more than a million current users check lightning fast gaming,
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:51.560]   which delivers downloads faster, no lag, no glitches, no outages, check mobile content optimization.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.520]   That offers automatic and simple image optimization.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:57:00.320]   So your site loads faster on every device check, multi CDN for redundancy and failover.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:04.080]   Your traffic is intelligently balanced across multiple providers.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:08.400]   So you always get the shortest routes and you mitigate against performance glitches.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.680]   In fact, I got to tell you, CashFly has been 100% available in the past 12 months.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:19.040]   That's not, I'm not talking four, nine, five, nine, six, 100% availability over the past year,
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:26.720]   30% faster than other major CDNs with a 98% cash hit ratio, 100% if you get their storage optimization system.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:27.600]   This is CashFly.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.640]   This is what we love.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.160]   Thank you, CashFly, for making everything we do possible.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:40.000]   I want you to check it out at cashfly.com and you can count on CashFly with that 24/7, 365 day,
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.040]   a year priority support.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.840]   They're always there when we need them.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:44.200]   Thank you, CashFly.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:49.200]   I say it every time bandwidth for this week in Google brought to you by CashFly.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:53.480]   At CACHE, F-L-Y.com.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.000]   Thank you, CashFly.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:02.960]   We didn't talk about this when it was reported earlier this month.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:07.680]   And I mostly because I thought it was a little suspicious.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:14.400]   It came from the Intercept, which is, I think, slowly moved into the realm of conspiracy theory.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:24.440]   They said the Intercepted Big Story saying that leaked documents prove that Department of Homeland Security
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:30.200]   has been working with Meta and Google and other tech companies to suppress information.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:33.920]   In fact, I saw it again just the other day from this story.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:35.840]   Oh, Meta has a portal.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.720]   The feds can use any time, any time they want to spread disinformation.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:43.640]   I'm sure you all saw the story.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:47.120]   And I wonder if I made a mistake by not bringing it up.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.520]   I feel like it was the right thing to do.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.720]   And Mike Masnick a couple of days ago
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:56.760]   maybe confirmed my initial judgment by calling it BS reporting.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:01.880]   The Intercepted Story about government policing disinfo is absolute garbage.
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:04.600]   He says the entire article is a complete.
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.080]   By the way, a lot of emails saying, "Leo, why aren't you covering this?"
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:09.120]   Well, I agree with Mike.
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.600]   The entire article is a complete nothing burger
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:17.200]   and is fueling a new round of lies and nonsense from people who find it useful to misrepresent reality.
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:22.920]   This this goes back to SISA, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency,
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:25.200]   which was started by President Trump in 2018.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:30.280]   One of the things SISA did was start information sharing between government private entities.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:35.400]   To in fact, it's been used several times to warn, for instance,
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:43.160]   meta and Twitter about big disinformation campaigns, attempts to hack them.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:49.560]   A lot of useful stuff that I think we would agree that that SISA should be doing.
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.760]   Actual threats.
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:54.120]   But
[01:59:54.120 --> 02:00:01.720]   and Mike says this, given these companies historical distrust of government intrusion
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:04.720]   and their understanding of the limits of government authority here,
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:08.040]   the companies have been pretty attuned to any attempt to coercion.
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:11.560]   And I've heard nothing regarding SISA at all.
[02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:20.360]   The bombshells, he says, reveal stuff that's already completely public
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.000]   that anybody could have read.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.200]   There was never any attempt to hide this.
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:30.800]   The public output of the meeting is available directly on the SISA site for anyone to download.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:33.360]   So this isn't exactly a scoop.
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.600]   He said, Mike points out the intercept published a blurry draft version,
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.160]   making it seem more secret and nefarious, but it's all public.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:47.760]   And it isn't this what we want the government to do to help sites like Twitter,
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.040]   meta, Google, stop election misinformation,
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.600]   bought farms from Russia and so forth.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:56.000]   So it's like reading the age of Mr.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.160]   Shana Zuboff.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:59.280]   I took the cover off, so I have I actually have the book.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.760]   It's kind of a thin book.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.800]   The way you get the full.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:08.800]   You got the yeah, yeah, but she goes on and on and on about things that we all know
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:14.840]   and just treating it through a conspiratorial lens of, oh, my God, the CIA use Google.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.640]   So do we all?
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:20.320]   Yeah, you know, what's what's your point?
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:23.960]   But what is all presented that way when that's your that's your worldview,
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:27.080]   you're built on Shaowong, the German word, my Glenn,
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:30.320]   then then everything looks like conspiracy.
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:32.760]   And that's part of the property intercept is that's the way they see the world.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.080]   They have they have from beginning.
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.120]   Yeah, you know, we're going to be saying it.
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.320]   He is now.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:41.000]   Yeah, anything with Lee Fang's name on it, I'm not going to I'm not going to read
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:47.720]   as a straightforward piece of reporting because he runs to Tucker Carlson to Trump
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:48.920]   at what he writes about.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.680]   And he's, you know, Lee Fang is actively involved in the spread of misinformation
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.360]   by participating in far right and, you know, other right wing media.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.680]   And it's very hard.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:00.680]   There's certainly people who are there.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.960]   Certainly conservative news outlets or outlets that try to straddle some line
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:10.320]   that I'm not going to raise any capital about because that there's they're credible
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:13.880]   and they're reporting and they use they, you know, correct stories that are wrong.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.480]   And so forth, Tucker Carlson, when he gets forced to admit it,
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.760]   it says he's an entertainer, you know, more or less.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.560]   You're not supposed to take him seriously, just like all the other people.
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:26.800]   And those there's not no not news programs on Fox.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.920]   So if Lee Fang is going to go there, then how do I take these statements?
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:34.960]   Credibly, you know, if he can go on Rachel Maddow and he could go on Tucker Carlson,
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.640]   then I'd have more interest in it, right?
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:39.880]   If he could stand up at the scrutiny of both of those, but he can't just like
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.520]   like we won't, you know, you know, who started the intercept along with
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:48.320]   a video.
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:48.840]   I forgot her.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.680]   Yeah.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:51.040]   Pierre, a media.
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:52.320]   Pierre, a video.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:53.360]   Thank you.
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:59.200]   He played well now was just somewhere else.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:02:59.960]   Beyond.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:03.680]   I mean, the fact that he was was being sounding favorable
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:09.800]   about Bolsonaro who had terrorized his family and children and him.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.440]   And, you know, essentially put his life in danger, I would say, if not,
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.680]   just his freedom.
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:17.240]   And then he's like, well, Bolsonaro, Bolsonaro, Bolsonaro.
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:19.920]   And I think if people have pointed out that like, you know, there's a finger
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:24.040]   in the air for Greenwald, whether if Bolsonaro had actually had one, you know,
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.760]   where Greenwald would be putting his loyalties after that.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:30.360]   And you're just like, my God, this man can't even act in his own self
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:31.960]   preservation in telling the truth.
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:32.680]   Right.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.160]   Okay.
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.040]   All right.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:39.040]   So I don't feel too bad about it.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:40.960]   It didn't smell past the smell test.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.080]   Is it kind of story, Leo?
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.440]   You had to let settle first.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:45.880]   You had to see where the crumbs landed.
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:49.720]   Oh, the other Snowden is criticizing very nicely, though.
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:53.400]   I'm going to say Edward Snowden, who is applied for Russian citizenship.
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:57.280]   And I think, you know, let me zoom that back where I think Snowden did a
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.680]   significant service to global democracy and what he revealed initially,
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:05.160]   because I think he revealed a lot of programs that weren't well understood
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:09.920]   or known about any promoted to a provoked massive change in the encryption
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.920]   and security ecosystem around the world.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:16.800]   So Bravo there, but he has applied for Russian citizenship at a spectacular
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.280]   time because there's nowhere else from to go.
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:22.880]   And so I don't know under what circumstances he is being monitored
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:23.720]   or can speak freely.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:26.280]   It seems like it would be very dangerous for him to do that.
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:29.760]   And he was like, I like Mike Masnick, but I don't think he's on.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.480]   I think he's off target on this story.
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:34.720]   So I'm like, you know, again, I'm kind of Snowden criticizing.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.840]   It doesn't make me feel any better about, I'm sorry,
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:40.280]   Croden, Snowden criticizing Mike Masnick's take.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.360]   Doesn't make me feel any better about the intercept story.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:42.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:45.120]   It's kind of, I guess it's through.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:47.240]   It depends what lens you view it through.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:50.640]   And if you expect to find conspiracy and you don't want government
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.880]   and Facebook or government and Twitter to be in any way communicating,
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:57.440]   then you could assume some sort of nefarious action.
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:01.280]   But on the other hand, I think you can say, but the government also has an
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:04.040]   interest in not spreading, for instance, COVID misinformation.
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:09.480]   Facebook has a portal for anyone, including the government to report misinformation.
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:11.520]   That's the portal the government uses.
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:16.560]   I don't I don't think that that's an inappropriate thing for the government to do.
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.640]   But again, it depends on the lens you view it through.
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:26.120]   Yeah, I don't want to by default trust this CSA, the CSA.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:26.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:32.880]   And it's a or any, I mean, it's kind of like trusting big pharma or insurance or whatever.
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.840]   It's like a cable companies.
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:36.040]   I don't want to trust any of those folks.
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:39.400]   But when you see presented straightforwardly,
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:45.840]   when you see information that's publicly available and available in a straightforward way,
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:50.920]   being presented as secrets because that benefits the way the story is being told,
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:54.160]   it's very hard to take it seriously.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:55.160]   Yeah.
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:55.760]   All right.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:01.280]   Well, I invite you to if you are listening and say, well, wait a minute,
[02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:06.520]   go to tech dirt com read the November 2nd article about the intercept story.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:07.920]   It has a link to the story as well.
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:10.560]   You can read that story and make up your own man.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:16.680]   But I have to say, I generally fall on the side of Mike Masnek as a trustworthy reporter.
[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:17.360]   Yeah.
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:17.840]   Yeah.
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:19.360]   For decades now.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:22.960]   And somebody we got to get back on the show again soon.
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:27.360]   Actually next week, it's going to be very interesting on Twig.
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.520]   Did I mention this yet?
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:32.360]   Stacey has really had it with me.
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:33.880]   Apparently.
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:37.880]   No, she had previously scheduled.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.960]   Everybody bought and she's had it with.
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:40.360]   Yeah.
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.200]   Yeah, pretty much.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:44.560]   She she only had to has a two appearances this month.
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:45.600]   She's going to miss this week.
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:49.320]   Next week, Matthew Ingram will fill in for Stacey.
[02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:56.960]   She'll be back on the 23rd and then the show after Thanksgiving, Alex Stamos.
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:00.520]   I can't wait for this for Stacey Higgenbotham.
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:03.200]   Who is Alex Stamos, you might ask.
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:03.520]   Isn't it?
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:06.320]   Was he the guy on different different strokes?
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:06.760]   No.
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:07.840]   Full house?
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.440]   No, not that Alex Stamos.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.320]   Come on, dude.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:16.640]   He is the former chief security officer at Facebook.
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.240]   He is also now at the Center for International Security and Cooperation.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:24.800]   He'd be a good guy to ask about this story, actually.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:29.560]   Adjunct professor at Stanford University Center for International Security and Cooperation.
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:33.880]   Also, but also to ask him about the vulnerabilities of the Fediverse.
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:34.640]   Yes.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.480]   Yeah.
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:41.200]   He'll be he'll be very good to talk to security guru Alex Stamos.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:42.640]   That's November 30th.
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:49.520]   So yes, I know Stacey hates me, but we're just going to muddle along as best we can.
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:52.880]   And then she says she's going to be here all through December, except you're going to
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:54.160]   leave on December 14th.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:56.720]   One one one day I got to be gone for school.
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:58.440]   I'm always here.
[02:07:58.440 --> 02:07:59.760]   You're glad to get rid of me.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:01.320]   I know the truth.
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:04.320]   Actually, our best jobs are coming up.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:07.760]   We're, you know, we're almost to Christmas here.
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:11.480]   We usually take the week between Christmas and New Year's off.
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:12.120]   We'll be doing that.
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:13.320]   We'll have best jobs then.
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.200]   So, but we will have a show December 21st.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.360]   Take the 28th off and then we'll be back in the New Year.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:25.800]   So just a little programming notes for the next few weeks.
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.160]   Let you know what's coming up.
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:34.200]   You know, I miss Stacey, but it's been we've been able to fill that role.
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:36.200]   The third seat with some great people.
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.560]   So it's worked out pretty well.
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:41.240]   It's we've been having having Matt Mullenweg having rabble.
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:45.800]   Alan, these are Kevin Mark's, Kathy Yellis, Doug Rushkoff.
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:47.400]   Some of these things.
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:48.720]   One timer is interesting, too.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:48.720]   Yeah.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:49.080]   Yeah.
[02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:53.480]   So I, you know, it says much as much as it hurts me.
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:57.320]   I wonder who you're going to find to replace me on December 14th.
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:58.840]   Actually, maybe my basic.
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:08:59.960]   That'd be good.
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:02.200]   Oh, or should we get something really cranky?
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:06.320]   No, I'm teasing.
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.120]   You're great, Jeff.
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:07.840]   You can.
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:11.720]   This show is really your show.
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:14.640]   I'm just here to keep the commercials.
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:15.680]   What would Google do?
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:16.560]   What would Google do?
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:17.120]   That's right.
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:19.280]   That's that's right.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.160]   I have a reporter calling me tomorrow from Portugal.
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:23.640]   Say, okay, okay.
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:26.000]   So now are you going to do what would musk do?
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:29.960]   That'd be a fun book.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.320]   The exact opposite.
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:32.280]   It'd be like crazy.
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.520]   Got an ignorance.
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:34.680]   Yeah.
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:36.720]   So this is a story.
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:38.440]   We'll wait till Stacey's back in a couple of weeks.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:39.360]   Matter is here.
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:40.840]   Matters launch event.
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:44.520]   I'm sure Stacey, that's probably where Stacey is actually.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:45.040]   Yeah.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.360]   So we'll be talking about matter with her, the new Google
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:53.960]   slash Apple slash everybody else.
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:57.560]   Interruptibility solution for home automation.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:01.560]   And Stacey will be here for that in a couple of weeks.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:04.680]   Let's do, why don't we the Google change law?
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:06.080]   What do you say?
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:07.520]   The goal change.
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.120]   I know.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.520]   Crazy, huh?
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:16.280]   Well, don't get your hopes up because it's just as dopey as ever.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:20.840]   Google has been so bad the last two months.
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:22.480]   There's not doing anything.
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:23.080]   You're right, Aunt.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.240]   They're not doing a thing.
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.720]   They haven't done massive layoffs at Google out.
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:28.720]   Well, they're not.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.080]   But they are in a hold.
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:30.760]   They are in a hold.
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:32.000]   Just like Facebook is.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.280]   Apple is on a hold.
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:34.440]   Everybody's in a hold now.
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:34.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:35.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:35.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:36.920]   It's reported they're frozen through.
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.360]   I'd like to announce we're going to add 4,000 new staffers tomorrow.
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:41.760]   And I'm very excited about that.
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:43.600]   What would they do if we did?
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:44.080]   I don't know.
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.240]   Carry coffee to you.
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:48.520]   A continuous round of coffee.
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:52.280]   I'm going to put more coffee.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:53.200]   Would you like to more coffee?
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:54.200]   Please.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:54.720]   Thank you.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:55.240]   Good.
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:56.360]   You want some.
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:57.800]   Well, have them bring it to Ant.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:58.360]   There you go.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:10:59.920]   A bucket brigade to Ants House.
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:05.840]   Google messages, tests, gallery focused redesign of its photo picker.
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.120]   Yeah.
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.680]   All right.
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:12.800]   We talked about this a couple of weeks ago, but.
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:18.600]   But the photo picker is now coming to a gallery near you.
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:22.720]   The current picker launched in the left of the text field shows a live
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.040]   camera with a shortcut to open your device's gallery next to it.
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.840]   And the last image in your camera roll below that.
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:31.440]   The new UI still shows a viewfinder first.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:32.600]   Let's see if I can hear we go.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:33.960]   But look at this.
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:35.440]   Look at that.
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:37.880]   Yeah, I don't know what you're going to see.
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:41.360]   You're going to see something completely different.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:47.880]   You can now immediately browse folders with that shortcut also shrunken down.
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:50.040]   Your most recent shot gets the largest preview.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.640]   That's actually pretty big.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.200]   Is that the camera or no, there's a preview and there's the camera.
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:01.360]   As you scroll down, the pain gets larger and comfortably shows 15 pictures
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.840]   at a time in the bottom right corner, you get the fabs for the camera and the folders.
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:07.400]   So there you go.
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:09.480]   I don't I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:13.240]   Stadia refunds start today.
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:14.600]   I got my email.
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:16.400]   They didn't say.
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:19.480]   Oh, yeah, they didn't say they didn't say how they were going to refund it.
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:21.280]   They just said, standby.
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:25.360]   They're going to pay the developers back for all their wasted effort.
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:29.200]   Oh, they probably pay the developers to develop stuff in the first place.
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:31.000]   You remember killed by Google?
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.560]   There is a I think it's still running, right?
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:32.920]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:33.440]   I call it.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:33.880]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:34.240]   Cool.
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:37.160]   Yeah, I just looked it up because I remember Stadia.
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:38.920]   I was like, Oh, man, they killed Stadia.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:44.560]   And then I thought, you know, it's been a long time since they killed a lot of stuff.
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:45.880]   There was just felt like it was a point.
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:49.000]   Google was killing something every month and sometimes beloved products.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.880]   I'm like, I feel like they have they've slowed down on the death rate.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.920]   Their murder toll is the Google homicide.
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:54.920]   They're all much less to kill.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:56.400]   That's the problem.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.760]   Well, that's okay to get down your core products.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:00.720]   Here's the discover blogger.
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:01.360]   One of these days.
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:03.360]   He don't tell them.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:04.440]   They don't even know they're running it.
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:08.400]   Here is the from Stadia, the email I received as part of Stadia's
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.720]   wind down process today.
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:14.160]   We're beginning to process the refunds we outlined in our September 29th announcement.
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:15.720]   We're getting in touch.
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:21.200]   How exciting to let you know what to expect over the next couple of weeks.
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:29.320]   We will we will attempt to automatically refund each transaction of the form of payment used to make the purchase.
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:35.400]   If that doesn't work, you're going to get an email with a link for Stadia players that have deleted their Google account.
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:38.240]   We're still going to attempt to automatically refund the transaction.
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:40.160]   When will you receive your refund?
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:41.400]   You might ask.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.120]   We ask for your patience.
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:50.440]   Expect the majority of refunds to be processed by January 18th, 2023.
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:54.080]   When will I get my say soon?
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:54.920]   That's not soon.
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:57.000]   When will I get my Google hardware purchase refund?
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:04.440]   We're working through this process and still anticipate the majority of refunds will be processed by January 18th, 2023.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:09.640]   No, how much money you think this is being refunded?
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.360]   Well, it's impossible.
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:14.640]   I mean, they killed it because it was a flop, right?
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:15.440]   So it's impossible.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:17.840]   But I know a lot of people who bought games.
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:19.160]   You're not going to get your weird.
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.760]   You're not going to get your monthly fees as I understand it from the previous message.
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.760]   You're not going to get your monthly fees refunded.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:28.160]   But games you purchased and more importantly, hardware you purchased.
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:32.160]   Like if you've got that Google Pro joystick, which I ordered, then canceled.
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:35.160]   So I don't think I actually was surprised to get this.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:37.160]   Is there any is like the Qcat?
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:40.160]   Is there any hack of this hardware you could do with this stuff?
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.160]   Well, yeah, I guess you could use it as a Bluetooth controller, I guess.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:45.160]   I don't know.
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:46.160]   That's a good question.
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:51.160]   I will I will I will say he could use it for I really could open and open and close the blinds.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:53.160]   Here's one you're going to want to know about.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:54.160]   Actually, this is good news.
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:57.160]   If you buy Google one, you get a VPN.
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:59.160]   Oh, yeah, this is good.
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.160]   This is really good.
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:03.160]   Now you're going to be able to use it with your desktop, windows or Mac.
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:04.160]   Yeah.
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.160]   So is that where you got a Chromebook?
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:08.160]   Shh.
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.160]   Actually, they don't mention Chromebook.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:17.160]   Google one VPN is those of you who are on the available those of you on the premium.
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:18.160]   Google one plan.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.160]   That's two terabytes or higher.
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.160]   I do pay for that one or I'm paying for that.
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:26.160]   Yeah, not the hundred gigabyte basic or the 200 gigabyte standard.
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:27.160]   No, I think I might be.
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:30.160]   Yeah, if you're paying 10 bucks a month.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:31.160]   Oh, maybe not that.
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:32.160]   Wait a minute.
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:33.160]   It'd be worth it though.
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:35.160]   If you got what's what's two terabyte?
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.160]   That's a 10 dollar.
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:38.160]   Yeah, 10 dollars a month.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:40.160]   And that'd be worth it with a VPN.
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:42.160]   Yeah, and you can share it with five users.
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:43.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:45.160]   So your family, you get the family.
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:48.160]   You get 10% off on the Google store.
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.160]   So I mean, I thought it paid for itself.
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:52.160]   I thought it was worth worthwhile.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:54.160]   Yeah, $10 a month is a good value.
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:56.160]   You get Google workspace premium.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:59.160]   They say girl, you get Google worth.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:04.160]   You get, you know, you get starting with longer group meet calls, YouTube live streaming recording
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:06.160]   and noise cancellation.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:12.160]   You'll have to install the VPN from the Google one website by going to benefits VPN protection
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:16.160]   for multiple devices and download app.
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:17.160]   I will try it.
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:22.160]   I'll let you know if Mr. Gibson had anything nice to say about their particular VPN service.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:23.160]   He didn't.
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:26.160]   Oh, because I know he's just wired a few over to pass.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:27.160]   Yeah.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:29.160]   If it uses, let me see if it says what it uses.
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:31.160]   If he uses WireGuard, then it's good.
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:33.160]   I feel like it does.
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:40.160]   The coming weeks, Google release and updated independent audit for the VPN on Windows and
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:41.160]   Mac.
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:43.160]   So you'll be able to see how it does.
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.160]   So that's good.
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:47.160]   Jeff, they didn't mention in Chromebook because they forgot they make Chromebook as well.
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:48.160]   Yes.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.160]   Chromebook, what's that?
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:50.160]   They deserve me.
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:51.160]   Some days they remember us.
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:56.160]   If you're, if you're a workplace, you can't use it anyway because they'll stop you from
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:57.160]   doing that.
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.160]   Yeah.
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:59.160]   Whatever the call it this week.
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:00.160]   Yeah.
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:04.160]   But yeah, I'm on the, I'm on the two terabyte plan, I believe.
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:05.160]   Me too.
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:06.160]   The $99 a year.
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.160]   Yeah.
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:09.160]   I think they just got built for it.
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:13.160]   I didn't know they have a 10 terabyte plan.
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:15.160]   20 terabyte plan.
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:17.160]   What is that available with one of the ability?
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.160]   How much?
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.160]   It doesn't say.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.160]   Does he have to ask?
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:23.160]   If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:29.960]   Well, am I, I wish to, I'm going to pay 50 bucks a month for the 10 terabytes and 100
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:30.960]   bucks a month for 20 terabytes.
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:31.960]   That's a lot of storage.
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:33.960]   I pay Apple for a couple terabytes.
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:35.960]   You know, I pay Dropbox.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.960]   Microsoft included an Office 360.
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:39.960]   I pay Google.
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:41.960]   Like how many terabytes do I need off that?
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:43.960]   Have I told you about true bill lately?
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:44.960]   Our sponsor.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:45.960]   Our sponsor.
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:47.960]   We're not getting money.
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:48.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:49.960]   The first.
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:50.960]   Go ahead.
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:52.960]   I'm in 10 terabytes.
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.960]   That's starting to look pretty good.
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:55.960]   Not that I think about it.
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:56.960]   You can use it.
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:57.960]   You, you have a lot of pictures.
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:58.960]   You made it.
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:05.720]   Oh, many files all over the place and that's, that's not a bad idea.
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:13.440]   The November security patch came out for your Pixel 7 and 7 Pro and three fixes included
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.000]   fix for an issue in battery and charging causing increased power consumption with certain
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.400]   apps, a fix for green display flickering in certain conditions.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:29.640]   More consumption has been optimized to improve thermal performance under certain conditions
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:34.400]   and there's a fix for an issue of caselink causing photos app to crash.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:38.400]   And of course, there's the security fixes, but I had downloaded it the other day.
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:42.920]   I think it's a small download, 26 megabyte download and it applied pretty quickly.
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:50.280]   So if you've got a Pixel 7 or 7 Pro, get that and finally optimize YouTube shorts player
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.320]   for your TV.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:53.320]   Look at that.
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:19:00.600]   You've got a beautiful widescreen TV and a little vertical video on there.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:01.600]   That's great.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:02.600]   Yeah.
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:03.600]   Thank God.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.440]   They're bringing shorts to TV screens.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.400]   That's all I can say.
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:12.160]   That's all I got.
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:17.000]   And that's the, that's a Google change lock.
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000]   That's it.
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000]   Ah, you know what?
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.720]   I'm sure that people will watch the shorts.
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:24.080]   It's not exactly TikTok.
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:25.760]   Is it as good as Quebe though?
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.520]   Oh, yeah, Quebe.
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:28.520]   Right?
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:29.520]   Well, you get a little bit of it.
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:31.520]   Quebe you can quit be on my quibi.
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:32.960]   You can put it on your big screen TV.
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:36.000]   No, it wasn't around long enough to learn how to pronounce his name.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000]   No, exactly.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000]   No.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000]   That was your brain shells.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.080]   You have given up.
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:42.080]   You don't care anymore.
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:47.160]   Did you know, let's see, this is all from our co-host contributed section.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:48.680]   Well, it's not much there.
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:52.520]   Google and Renault are developing a software-divined vehicle together.
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:53.520]   What?
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:58.320]   We're going to have an expert from Renault on tomorrow, I think on Tech News Weekly.
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:19:59.320]   Oh.
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:00.320]   Hmm.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:01.840]   Yeah, automotive Android.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:06.440]   You can buy it in Renault in America.
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:08.920]   Now you're asking a question I just don't know.
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:11.840]   Renault Nissan Mitsubishi.
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:13.520]   So I guess you can buy a Nissan.
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.520]   I know you can.
[02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:15.520]   Oh, I see.
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:16.520]   All right.
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:20.800]   So, the Renault's the big, is the number two auto company in the world, I think, to integrate
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:24.120]   its software platform and services like Google Maps and Assistant into vehicles.
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:29.680]   Now, Renault Group, Renault, Dacia, Alpene and Mobileese is expanding that partnership
[02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:32.280]   to develop a software-defined vehicle.
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.200]   So that's an interesting term.
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:40.400]   In ham radio, you have software-defined radios used to have to have tubes and dials and resistors
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:43.480]   and things to tune in frequency.
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:48.040]   Now, most ham radios, they're just computers and the radio is software-defined.
[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:52.120]   You can even put a ham radio on your phone with software.
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:54.560]   So what is a software-defined vehicle?
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:55.840]   That's what I wanted you to explain to me.
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:56.840]   I have no idea.
[02:20:56.840 --> 02:21:04.720]   You just turn some dials and it turns from a Porsche into a Tesla truck, I think.
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:11.600]   The aim, according to Engadget, is to deliver new on-demand services and continuous upgrades
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:16.440]   to the car with Google acting as the preferred cloud provider.
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:20.400]   To accelerate development, the companies will work together on a digital twin or virtual
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.040]   version of the car.
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:26.160]   It'll use advanced AI capabilities to allow the companies to more easily integrate new
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:31.840]   features and services into the vehicle while allowing for new on-board in-car services
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:34.760]   and off-board applications.
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.760]   Continuous upgrades.
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:41.440]   Yeah, there's nothing that says safety like continuous upgrades.
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:47.800]   According to the companies, a software-defined vehicle will allow predictive maintenance
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:50.360]   and better detection and rectification.
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:51.800]   That sounds painful.
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:55.400]   Failure in near real time, if necessary.
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:56.880]   It'll also allow for a...
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:01.320]   I had a rectification last week at the doctors.
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:02.320]   It'll also allow for a person...
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:03.320]   I hope they gave you a sedation.
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:04.320]   Yeah, they did.
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:05.320]   You know.
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:07.320]   I'm here for my rectification.
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:09.760]   It'll also allow for a personalized experience.
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:13.640]   I'll call you a thaw called that.
[02:22:13.640 --> 02:22:17.040]   It'll also allow for personal...
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:18.600]   That's what happens with Stacy's gone.
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:19.600]   I would never...
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:21.920]   I would never have said that.
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:22.920]   Stacy been here.
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:23.920]   Yes.
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:24.920]   In the form we're going to leave the hospital.
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:25.920]   I think so.
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:29.280]   Dr. Tolle, I had rectification.
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:34.000]   It'll allow for personalized experience that adapts to driving behavior.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.720]   It'll adapt to your driving behavior like frequent destinations, EV charging stations,
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:40.720]   etc.
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:41.720]   It'll...
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:42.720]   Oh, here's the...
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:45.440]   Okay, you want the real bottom line?
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:52.840]   It'll also help the companies build "insurance models" based on actual usage and driving behaviors.
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:54.680]   So apparently, that's what a Tesla is.
[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:57.240]   It's a software-defined vehicle.
[02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:00.480]   If you'd like to turn left ahead, you'll need to watch this five-minute advertising.
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:05.680]   Or a radio pack, the premium package for an immediate left.
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:10.960]   Did you see that Berkeley has followed a New York City's footsteps and has banned the
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:13.520]   right turn on red?
[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:14.520]   No.
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:15.520]   That passed?
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:17.680]   What's Berkeley thinking they are?
[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:18.680]   That passed?
[02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:19.680]   That passed.
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:20.680]   So...
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:21.680]   Oh, man.
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:22.680]   The right turn on red.
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:23.680]   Oh, they're just so wacky.
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:26.360]   It's...
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:28.160]   It's probably left on red because it's liberal.
[02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:29.160]   I don't know.
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:30.160]   Oh!
[02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:31.160]   Oh!
[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:35.200]   Everywhere except the New York City has allowed that.
[02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:37.200]   But New York...
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:38.680]   Now Berkeley...
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:41.120]   Well, I don't know if it's done.
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:43.520]   It was approved by the City Council.
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:45.520]   They're going to put up signs all over the city.
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:46.520]   It says...
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:47.520]   That'll work.
[02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:48.520]   That'll work.
[02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:49.520]   That'll be great.
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:50.520]   Yeah.
[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:55.000]   The right turn on red is an almost uniquely American maneuver says the San Francisco-
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.400]   No, it's a California...
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:57.400]   It's California.
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:23:58.400]   California invented this.
[02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:00.400]   It's a Woody Allen joke about the illegal...
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:01.400]   That's right.
[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:02.400]   That's what the California did.
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.200]   Largely prohibited in other countries.
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:10.760]   Most states enabled a move during the fuel crisis of the '70s as a gas saving measure.
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:11.760]   Immediately...
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:12.760]   Immediately...
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:14.800]   Immediately it started killing pedestrians.
[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:19.360]   A 60% increase in pedestrian accidents after right on red was implemented.
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:22.960]   84 people die every year.
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:26.040]   Run down by cars turning right on red.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:28.840]   The majority of which are pedestrians and cyclists.
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:29.840]   I still remember it.
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:30.840]   I still remember it.
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:31.840]   I came here to California.
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:35.560]   I had to learn to really, really look through the bike lane.
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:38.160]   We just down the street, somebody got run over.
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:39.160]   Me.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:40.560]   Same thing, right turn on red.
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:42.600]   Slow, wasn't moving fast.
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:44.160]   Hit the guy, knocked him over.
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:45.640]   He hit his head and died.
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:47.200]   So it is dangerous.
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:48.200]   Yeah.
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.200]   That was just over...
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.760]   In 1993, I'm driving a friend.
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:52.360]   We're driving back from a wedding in Indiana.
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:53.360]   We get to Manhattan.
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:54.360]   It's 2 a.m.
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:57.240]   I'm facing the church of St. John the Divine.
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:24:58.440]   It's a red light.
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:02.560]   I turn to my friend and say, "Hey, I can make a right turn on Rand in New York City.
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:03.560]   Can I?"
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:05.680]   I start to go and he says, "No!"
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:07.520]   As he says it, a police car goes by.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:10.000]   It's the only car on the road across us.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:11.760]   I was like, "He's just..."
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:15.000]   And then, and then, we found parking on the next block.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:16.000]   So that was...
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.000]   Carm Holy Night.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.480]   Carm Holy Night.
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:22.640]   So right turn on red.
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:23.840]   I don't know how I got on that.
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.440]   How the hell did you get on that?
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:26.440]   Are we still in the change lock?
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:27.440]   We're in the...
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:28.440]   So we're in the software-defined vehicle.
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.240]   Oh, yeah, we're software-defined vehicles.
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:31.240]   That's right.
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:33.080]   All they have to do is make the right turn on red a premium feature.
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:34.080]   I keep saying.
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:35.080]   That's right.
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:36.840]   You know, Berkeley, you want it right turn?
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:37.840]   You got to pay.
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:38.840]   You just pay for it.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:42.640]   This story just in from supplychaindive.com.
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:44.480]   See what I do for you.
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:46.680]   See how I comb the world.
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.080]   Bet you find that.
[02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:49.080]   That is a great publication.
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:50.960]   Now, I know I'm a friend who writes for them.
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:51.960]   That's a great publication.
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:52.960]   Oh.
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:53.960]   Okay.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:56.080]   It was a good trade journals out there.
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.480]   Look for this holiday season.
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:04.520]   An Amazon electric van coming to a neighborhood near you over a hundred cities.
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:05.520]   They look like for it.
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:10.960]   Don't listen for it because it's going to sneak up on you.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:12.800]   I'm not so proud.
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:13.800]   They're from revving.
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:16.960]   I think they should make their vehicles make more noise, actually.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:22.080]   Actually, in a way, we have a plague of cars that sound like hornets because all the electric
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:23.920]   vehicles make sounds.
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:29.760]   Mine included that are, in most part, not Felicidus, but they need to because of blind
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:35.360]   pedestrians and others who aren't, you know, can't or listening for a motor and they.
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:37.120]   Fisker makes a noise.
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:38.120]   What's it sound like?
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:39.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:40.120]   They all did.
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:44.200]   It sounds like a natural combustion engine.
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:46.200]   I get it though.
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:49.440]   I mean, it sounds fake, but you actually hear it.
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:52.440]   You know, it's so cool.
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:55.520]   Did you just play something Leo where a car you could change the sounds?
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:01.600]   Yeah, there's an aftermarket on the Mustang Mach-E, which I have to take it.
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:07.440]   I just did a Jack Benet's Maxwell, a little callback to your favorite TV show.
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:08.440]   I remember that.
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:11.360]   Yeah, I did watch Jack Benet's show and we run.
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:16.640]   TikTok slashes global revenue targets by at least two billion dollars.
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:24.320]   Meanwhile, TikTok taking over the world or is it just another company that has problems?
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:28.120]   Targets cut by 20%.
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:32.960]   They had initially projected revenues between 12 and 14 billion dollars this year, which
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:35.280]   is not huge compared to other big tech companies.
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:36.280]   No.
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:38.200]   That's for a whole year.
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:42.840]   I think Apple and Google make more than a quarter, but actual revenue now be leaves closer
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:46.080]   to be 10 billion dollars for the year.
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:49.520]   Oh, yeah, that's interesting.
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:54.080]   Here from another fine publication, the Noema magazine.
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.600]   Is that what you pronounce it?
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.640]   Oh, I guess you do because it has the Noema.
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:27:58.640]   What do you call that?
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:27:59.640]   What do you call that?
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:00.640]   Axante Guille.
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:02.440]   Oh, it's an axon.
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:03.440]   It's a...
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:05.520]   Is that a long E?
[02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:07.240]   So that makes it Noema?
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:10.960]   I think it's not tilted.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:12.280]   It's just a line.
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:13.800]   So that's the question.
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:16.120]   It's a macron.
[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:17.120]   A macron.
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:18.120]   Yes.
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:19.120]   Like the rest of it.
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:24.240]   Certainly it's named derives from the ancient Greek macron, which means long.
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:25.240]   Which means...
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:26.240]   So that's the long vowel.
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:27.240]   It's not a cutest.
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.320]   You've got typography questions.
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:30.880]   We got the answers right here.
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:31.880]   Yeah.
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:32.880]   Not long, but long.
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.440]   So it would be pronounced not Noema, but Noema.
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:37.440]   Noema.
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:38.440]   Noema.
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:39.440]   This long.
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.440]   Noema.
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:41.440]   Doesn't that mean...
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:42.440]   No.
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:43.440]   Noema means something about information.
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.440]   Oh, the Noosphere.
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:46.440]   Oh boy, you are really good.
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:47.440]   Wow.
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:48.440]   You are really good.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:49.440]   But see, when we get Glenn here, go into...
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:51.760]   No, except when you talk about rectitude.
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:52.760]   Mental.
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:53.760]   Everything moves up.
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:55.760]   But then you ruin it.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.760]   Noema.
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:57.760]   Noema.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:58.760]   Yeah.
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:28:59.760]   I see you look at that mental object.
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:00.760]   Mental object.
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:01.760]   Wow.
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:02.760]   Noema.
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:03.760]   It derives from the Greek word Noema.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:04.760]   Right?
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.760]   I'm just going to do...
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:08.760]   I'm just going to write it for myself.
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:11.760]   It takes literally to the word.
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:13.000]   >>You look at the fours.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000]   >>It takes really short a word.
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.520]   >>It's just our love Greek and it's from the Greek word from...
[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:19.300]   >>It's from rectify.
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:25.520]   In any event, according to Noema, online mobs act like flocks of birds.
[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:30.980]   >>That's by René D'Arresta, who's a major disinformation researcher at Stanford.
[02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:34.000]   >>Well I thought you were meant to say a source of researcher.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:34.700]   Oh, thank God.
[02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:36.000]   >>Oh, yeah.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.840]   >>Oh, it's just in a ticket wrong turn.
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:39.120]   >> Online.
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:40.120]   That's that word again.
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:41.140]   >>umbrings, memorations.
[02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:42.720]   >>Yes, the memorations of...
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:43.220]   >>Mmbrings.
[02:29:43.220 --> 02:29:44.880]   >>...of starlings are very famous.
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:45.880]   We've all...
[02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:50.740]   I hope you've all seen this where starlings are flying around and they have this amazing
[02:29:50.740 --> 02:29:53.920]   pattern that they follow.
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:56.760]   If you've never seen it, it's quite breathtaking.
[02:29:56.760 --> 02:29:58.960]   It's usually at sunset in the evening.
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:02.440]   >>I always think about this where, you know, there used to be so many passenger pigeons
[02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:04.280]   before they were hunted to extinction.
[02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:08.040]   The contemporary accounts are that they blackened the sky.
[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:09.640]   They were so many flying above America.
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:11.120]   Just think about...
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:13.220]   We get that with crows in my neighborhood sometime.
[02:30:13.220 --> 02:30:14.220]   >>Yeah.
[02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:15.220]   >>But they blackened the sky.
[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:16.220]   They just don't...
[02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:17.220]   >>The difference is part of it.
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:18.220]   Crows aren't good eating.
[02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:19.220]   >>Ah!
[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:20.220]   >>How are you?
[02:30:20.220 --> 02:30:21.220]   >>You tried.
[02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:22.220]   >>Yes.
[02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:24.700]   >>And say, "How do you know?"
[02:30:24.700 --> 02:30:27.140]   >>Our social box first formed...
[02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:28.140]   >>Oh boy.
[02:30:28.140 --> 02:30:29.140]   >>That's okay.
[02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:33.140]   >>Three times fast please.
[02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:35.940]   Social media flocks first formed in the mid-O-O's.
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:36.940]   Is that the OTS?
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:37.940]   How would we say that?
[02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:38.940]   >>The OTS.
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:43.960]   >>As the internet provided a new topology of human connection, at first we ported our
[02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:46.640]   real geographically constrained social graphs.
[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:48.080]   Who is this guy?
[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:51.080]   To nascent online social networks.
[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:53.580]   Dunbar's number held.
[02:30:53.580 --> 02:30:57.900]   We had maybe 150 friends, probably fewer, we saw and commented on their posts.
[02:30:57.900 --> 02:31:01.680]   However, it quickly became a point of pride to have thousands of friends and thousands
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:03.640]   of followers.
[02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:05.000]   Or in my case, millions.
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.000]   The friend or follower count was prominently displayed on a user's profile and a high number
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.240]   became a heuristic for assessing popularity or importance.
[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:17.080]   Friend became a verb.
[02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:19.360]   I'm going to friend you.
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:22.880]   We friended not only our friends, but our acquaintances, their friends and their friends
[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:23.880]   acquaintances.
[02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:27.480]   I don't know what this has to do with mobs.
[02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:28.480]   >>It's okay.
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:29.480]   Go on.
[02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:30.480]   >>It goes on and on and on.
[02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:31.480]   >>It does.
[02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:32.480]   It does.
[02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:33.480]   >>It does.
[02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:34.480]   >>It does.
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:39.160]   And it's and now we know the Greek word for noema oh we back to Twitter pretty pictures of birds
[02:31:39.160 --> 02:31:43.740]   Yes, I put stuff in here then I sometimes take it out but what I was working the word
[02:31:43.740 --> 02:31:51.700]   Go ahead, how do you say tweet in greek that's my question? Huh like we both a determinal
[02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:56.320]   We're gonna be funny if it was rectify
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:07.360]   Okay, uh, topia the reason I put that in there. Why did you put some topia in there 15 minutes in they have a comic on
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:14.380]   Stage at some topia if you go in and I could not figure out no little farther. It's woman making it
[02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:15.620]   Oh, she there
[02:32:15.620 --> 02:32:20.520]   You know it was back. It was back 15 minutes in here. Where'd we be on? Oh, I don't have a whole routine
[02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:25.420]   And I don't understand at all never mind. I don't even do it. No, what's is it funny?
[02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:29.580]   No, what's this is this here? Yes? Oh, I feel bad for
[02:32:29.580 --> 02:32:31.580]   any comic that has to do
[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:38.480]   Oh really, I'm so mortified
[02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:40.840]   Is she fainless?
[02:32:40.840 --> 02:32:47.460]   Yeah, yeah, she was on mad TV. I was told that's born Alex. I was told it was a zoom event and I didn't wear pants
[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:57.900]   She's probably too funny for this event
[02:32:57.900 --> 02:32:59.900]   I
[02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:01.940]   Still look at boys, though. I
[02:33:01.940 --> 02:33:08.620]   Am mortified and then the guy backstage is like don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. There's a podium and it's invisible
[02:33:08.620 --> 02:33:19.820]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I gotta point something out. What is this during this zoom event?
[02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:22.620]   There are people people behind her on
[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:26.500]   Yeah, of course it's zoomed opia. Yeah
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:32.340]   Andy karlucci who is doing our zoom ISO for us made this wall
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:42.740]   I've got my one degree of separation is I went to college with full Lamar
[02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:46.260]   Wow
[02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:49.960]   Yeah, it's all a little touch within a very nice phone. I will give her a lot of great
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:55.140]   She's probably making $30,000 for that appearance corporate events. I hope so
[02:33:55.140 --> 02:34:01.220]   They're horrible. They don't laugh. Yeah, and you have to get the executives name into your bit
[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:05.020]   Yes, it's always without without insulting me second, right?
[02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:13.520]   I know this I just I didn't event for her HBO one year. Oh, yeah had to follow Lewis black. That was my first mistake
[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:20.180]   Never do it. Where's the table?
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:29.620]   Oh, I hope it was a great geek it was in Palm Beach. It was at the beautiful pink hotel there not Mar-a-Lago the next door and
[02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:34.820]   You follow Lewis blackwood dev know it's a painful memory
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:38.420]   I'm just two words at
[02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:41.380]   Flop sweat. It was awful
[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:46.500]   Lops Leo. I can't I can't talk that but I was friends wedding
[02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:48.580]   I went to friends wedding and she asked me for dear friend
[02:34:48.580 --> 02:34:51.300]   She asked me to give it that's one of the handful of speeches
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:59.060]   After the wedding right and I was delighted to do so love this person and what I didn't know is I knew her brother is actually
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:04.660]   I don't want to drop names. He's a comedy writer for a major at the time for major television show
[02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:10.660]   And what I didn't know is he was gonna deliver his speech before mine. Oh god. I think I said, okay
[02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:15.060]   I think it was pretty funny, but it was very close. Yeah, it was very personal
[02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:20.660]   But it was a professional human writer and then there was me but I had I had a good pathos
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:29.060]   Yeah, you can always you know you can turn those events into something if the people know you if on the other hand you were a stranger brought in
[02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:32.820]   Oh my god, Lewis black you're following Lewis black. That's not good
[02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:36.980]   No, everyone's death after that too. They're like I can't even hear this guy Leo is
[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:40.660]   And I'm going I'd like to show you a lineup of the new smartphones for
[02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:42.660]   19

[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:54.020]   I thought well they had apple just announced that you could advance your keynotes using the phone
[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:56.180]   So I tried doing that and it didn't work
[02:35:56.180 --> 02:36:01.220]   So I have to go over to my laptop which is sitting on the stage at the front
[02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:08.660]   Yeah, I'll be windy in a moment. I just have to get this and I'm sweating it starting to pop up on my

[02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:20.100]   That's why I like to thank Carly Piaerena for inviting me here. Yeah, really
[02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:22.900]   I could have been Tori soprano. I look what happened
[02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:27.460]   I came off the stage and the woman gave me the check but boy she was not happy
[02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:35.540]   I'm just gonna go to my room now. Should I give you my nightmare one? You're you're not even here
[02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:38.260]   It's not not that scale at all not that scale at all
[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:43.860]   I was I was speaking to all the top editors of the New York Times at an off-site
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:46.900]   They all hated me. I was this blogger guy
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:51.220]   Journalism professor blogger guy couldn't stand but he invited me in right?
[02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:55.700]   I actually was my I was an atrial fibrillation at the time. I felt like crap
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:57.060]   Oh, boy
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:36:59.060]   Point to go through in this dining room
[02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:04.180]   And I did you know how you you make a powerpoint and you put all the extra slides at the end
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:07.780]   Yeah, right and you end up with lots and lots and lots of slides
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:09.940]   But you're never gonna get to them because they're always you know, which is me
[02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:12.820]   I accidentally hit the button that went all the way to the end of the slide
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:17.460]   Back they all just the room with the room grown
[02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:23.940]   I'm at 276 women. I gotta go back to the beginning
[02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:28.740]   Oh, yeah, they not not happy at all. No, that was actually I would do that a purpose
[02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:33.220]   Yes, just to get out. I'm sorry. Let's start with slide one
[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:38.740]   That would be funny actually it would be all right
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:44.420]   It is time for us to wrap up the show and we're gonna start doing that with your picks and numbers and all of that
[02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:47.540]   First, I'll start with the flongmaster himself
[02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:50.500]   Mr. Glenn Fleischman
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:52.660]   Your pick of the week my friend
[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:58.420]   My pick of the week is a web comic name a long-winning comic strip several years by
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:01.060]   Alex Norris
[02:38:01.140 --> 02:38:04.660]   English person and the reason I'm picking it's a very funny strip
[02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:08.340]   If I describe it to you'll recognize it immediately because it is everywhere on the internet
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:12.260]   It's a blobby character who says oh no with no punctuation. So
[02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:16.420]   It's always the unintended consequence things very funny. It's very delightful and
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:23.140]   The person who creates it is really is it Doris Mc Comics. Is that it? That's the previous one. Okay, and
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:29.860]   So this is called web comic name and that's the popular one boy. That'll that'll google well
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:37.300]   Yeah, I know what you're funny, but so so Alex is facing so Alex currently has i'm bringing this up because Alex currently has a go fund me
[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:42.740]   Uh going on to raise money for a lawsuit because somebody a few years ago
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:46.900]   Uh who he sorry they use a them Alex gave them
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:51.620]   uh rights to produce some board games based on
[02:38:51.620 --> 02:38:55.620]   a web comic name and this person has proceeded to
[02:38:56.180 --> 02:39:02.020]   produce other products not any board games and tries to even take the rights for the name and uh
[02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:05.380]   And so forth. It's a really lousy situation
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:09.620]   Uh, Alex posted the go fund me and said you know, I can't talk about it much
[02:39:09.620 --> 02:39:14.020]   But you can find the lawsuit online which I did and I read through it very quickly and holy cow
[02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:19.300]   I'm not a lawyer, but I feels like this is a situation. Uh, if you google the situation you'll find
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:24.020]   Other campaigns that the same person who Alex is suing
[02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:31.860]   Was involved with uh, this person's company's banned from kickstarter their ban from board game, uh fundraising sites
[02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:36.500]   Do they ever they never produce a game? They just they're scammers. They just no they they
[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:42.580]   The third part is they do they just take on too much and they're erratic and they don't charge the right shipping
[02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:46.420]   They're basically a bunch of completely flipped out. I mean, I don't you know, look
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:52.820]   I don't know them but you're reading the accounts the reporting is that they cannot meet their obligations and in particularly in Alex's case
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:58.420]   It sounds like they're taking advantage of them. So, uh, I uh, really like Alex's work elected for years
[02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:02.500]   It makes me it's making me happy and so I'm just mentioning that they've got you know, right
[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:06.340]   You can go and support them directly you can go and contribute to their legal defense
[02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:09.860]   The problem is they're in the UK and they have to sue in the United States
[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:14.180]   And as we all know even when you're on the right, it's very expensive and even if you win a lawsuit
[02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:19.700]   If the people you're suing don't happen as in Jeff's case with a contractor, perhaps don't have any money
[02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:22.980]   Yeah, then it can be hard to actually wind up coming out ahead
[02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:27.700]   So I would love to uh, I love Alex to succeed and there's a lot of great web cartoonists
[02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:32.260]   Out there who uh, there's different people who over pandemic especially, you know
[02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:36.100]   When your mental health is suffering from all the stuff that we went through the last few years
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:38.420]   And you go online and you see these things that make you feel happy
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:42.420]   And I'm like I want this person to succeed and someone else is trying to tear them down
[02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:47.140]   So that is my pick of the week is webcomic name go read it enjoy it and
[02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:50.820]   Support Alex in some way if you feel you like there work
