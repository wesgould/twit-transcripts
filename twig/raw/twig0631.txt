[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.160]   She was riding a ferry moments ago. Your hair looks perfect given that you just got off a boat
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.480]   Is that the is that the only way you can get to the island?
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.680]   There's a land crossing, but it takes an hour and a half to drive all the way around and you've got to go up through Tacoma. Yeah
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.040]   So yeah, and knowing Jeff Jarvis you he wouldn't want to go over a bridge anyway
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.480]   Well in the bridge is what was replaced replaced galloping girdy. So Jeff
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.680]   You see I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.160]   Tell it ya why do they call it galloping girdy?
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:09.400]   Yeah, I have a video I just want to give Stacy the chance to explain
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.280]   Galloping girdy. This was a bridge that was oh
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   My god look at that lord almighty over the Tacoma narrows. That's Jeff's worst nightmare
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   Yep, wow
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.160]   Taroff is sound so this doesn't get taken down
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.360]   Holy cow so and that was just from wind that wasn't an earthquake or anything
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.480]   No, that was just the way galloping girdy behave, but now it's different
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.280]   They also that would hurt
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.640]   That is such a brisk vibration. I think it would hurt you off loan car left on span
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   Is that a Disneyland?
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.960]   Through the air oh
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.200]   My oh my goodness. Yeah
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.000]   roadway breaks up
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.080]   So obviously they had to replace replace Galloping. Yes. This is not the same bridge
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.240]   Wow, we've already learned something in the first minute of the show
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.840]   Ladies gentlemen and now here he is the bridge of phobe himself the man who knows galloping girdy intimately
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.280]   Every bridge is a galloping girdy to him the Leonard Ta professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.400]   city of russian york we couldn't do it without you aunt
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.360]   When you weren't here we tried on Twitter. We can't nobody know what the hell we were doing
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.880]   I noticed that and I enjoyed Sunday
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.840]   Aunt Pruitt is a hands-on photography and of course the community manager at our fabulous
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.400]   Club twit and and the father of dragons. It's great to have him hard hits and hard heads hard heads
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.240]   Great to have him on the show today
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.020]   I'm if I'm a little bit shaky you'll have to forgive me because I just got my
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.800]   Pre no vous pre novo scans back of my body. Oh
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.720]   Boy do not ever do this
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.680]   I'm just oh no Leo. Do you feel all of the bacteria and stuff?
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.960]   I talked about the MRI that I got the special MRI where they do hundreds of extra images or something and
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.760]   The good news is I don't think I have cancer
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.200]   But you've got a little bit of everything else I got I got an atrophy kidney. I've got a
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.360]   For some reason I don't know why they even mark this my spine ends at T2
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   I don't know if that means I got no, but I don't know what the hell any of this means
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.080]   I guess to dust thoracic - wait, it just stops musculate here. I'll read it
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.640]   Well, he's been called spy to the spy on I I will read it to you now. We know for sure is a clinical observation
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.360]   and by the way, you can see it in this picture. I'm gonna scroll it down because you don't want you to see my junk, but
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   We don't
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.680]   You actually you don't really see anything it's a little disappointing
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:28.600]   It'll be a little more prominent in the in the photographs. I'm just I'm just saying
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.640]   There's a lot of there's a lot of little things, but this is exactly what they were saying why doctors hate these things
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.800]   These are body scans that you do without any indication that there's a problem
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.000]   Just kind of to see if there's anything going on is it inevitably you find things and then you pester them
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.520]   What's wrong? What's wrong doctor? Why didn't you see this? What did you see this?
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.160]   Atrophied kidney that sounds like no fun. It doesn't sound good, but I think it's you've got to it got to they said
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.480]   You may not have ever seen any symptoms because you got to and one may even be working
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   It's just a little smaller than the other. I think it's one of those things like everybody's a little weird
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.920]   I got one kidney smaller than the other big deal anyway
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.360]   I'll I'll scan sounds like the real life version of web MD. It's kind of that
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.320]   Now there's cancer there's one that I never even thought about
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:30.080]   But they say discuss this finding with your doctor on a semi urgent basis. I have mastoiditis in my right
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   sinus
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.040]   But like a sinus infection, no
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.160]   My right mastoid
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.560]   There's a factorial infection that affects the mass
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.320]   Really moles like behind the ear if you look at the picture my mastoid on the right is just loaded with something
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.360]   And the one on the left is empty. Huh, so oh my god, so now that can explain
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.160]   Nothing I have no symptoms
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.680]   You don't have any sinus pain or anything
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.580]   No, my nose is a little quiet is it the side you put the hearing thing in or not? No, it's a side
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.680]   I have B no I put it in both sides you put the I have B in no
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.000]   But I do have actually I just feel a little bit congested on the right side now
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.400]   I think right because I use of course. Oh, you know doctor. I have been wondering why I'm tilted to the right all the time
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.720]   Maybe they'll fix it and your voice will change. Oh
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.600]   My god, that's exactly what they said on Reddit
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.800]   Well, not exactly, but that's what they say on Reddit
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.000]   They said look you're gonna find things wrong because a lot of false positives
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.160]   You're gonna spend a lot of money time correcting them and it may actually make things bad make things worse
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.480]   Because maybe so like maybe they say oh well, we're gonna fix your mastoid
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.140]   I must talk like this for the rest of my life and it's my whole career
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.240]   I'm gonna make for a fun podcast, but not be good. Hi
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.600]   Anyway, so
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.400]   We were talking in fact we talked a lot by the way you were right at great show on Sunday on Twitter
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.520]   We had Jeff joined two other very
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.060]   As the big kids table. I'm always so happy
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:06.440]   It was a class of wine in front of you. It was too big the big kids. I was completely intimidated
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:14.280]   It was really good two professors of journalism Jeff Jarvis and Dan Gilmore from Arizona State University's Cronkite School
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.640]   And a guy that I've idolized since I started in tech journalism
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:25.260]   Stephen Levy who wrote hackers and many other great books and just wrote a Facebook book and of course
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.240]   Was the white male journalism panel? Yes, it was the one you were talking about last time when you tell them
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.680]   Should I had Kara Switcher on that would have really added to the
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.400]   Somehow I think she's hard to book. You know, she used to be on Twitter a lot. She used to be here a lot
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.280]   I remember watching it. Yeah, that was when that was before. Yeah, it was when she was back with the all things D
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.460]   Mm-hmm. We actually she you may think that she canceled us
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.440]   We canceled her because her dog pooped in the living room carpet. So yeah, I heard about that
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.560]   Wow
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.520]   So no her living room or you're living ours. No, I hear the studio. She was in the studio. Oh
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:12.480]   Kind of dog this Kara Swisher have I forgot what kind of do you remember John was a little dog and
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.960]   You know, not a big deal. I'm just kidding. I mean these things happen. I've pooped on the living room carpet
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.960]   It's just
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:30.840]   The reason I spoke yeah, that's why I brought it up because we talked a lot about the Wall Street Journal Facebook files
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:37.440]   Long I think it's still going on. I feel like the Wall Street Journal is still publishing articles or our conversations to go in on
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.960]   Yeah, it was kind of endless and then
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.080]   Facebook is gonna be called on the carpet actually
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:53.000]   Congress the Senate has they I believe the whistleblower they want whistleblower status who revealed the information from the internal Facebook studies
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.200]   To the Wall Street Journal Facebook of course said well, that's not you know, you're not seeing the whole picture
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.640]   They said we were talking last week on this show about the fact that Instagram
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.360]   Has in their studies showed that some made some girls who felt bad about themselves feel worse
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.560]   But then Facebook comes back with in 11 out of 12 metrics girls felt better
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.760]   So it's that it's one of those and of course they're still not releasing of the 12 day counted
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   Yeah, it was probably about 30 metrics. I think though the pressure is gonna is starting to
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:34.720]   To kind of tell the the head of safety from Facebook is testifying in front of the Senate this week and they say that we will publish
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.360]   some
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.320]   Some Nick Clegg was speaking in a public event hosted by the Atlantic
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.560]   They were released to data the data to Congress before making available to the public
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:53.280]   particularly two internal slide decks talking about how Instagram affects teens mental health but I
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   Think there is one positive side of this Adam Massari the found the head of face Facebook's Instagram Instagram Instagram said
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.440]   We are gonna pause
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.040]   The development of an Instagram for kids
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.080]   Yeah, and and and why they ever started that it's just indicative of not reading the room
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.720]   Yeah, the idea because of course a
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.680]   COPPA
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   The child online protection and privacy act prevents kids companies from gathering data on kids under 13
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.360]   Which really hit hamper's Facebook. So
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.400]   In theory face kids under 13 can't join Instagram or Facebook
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.080]   So they were gonna make an Instagram kids for kids under 13 which would say one can't argue
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.420]   I'm not gonna argue this one could argue that knowing that that's happening anyway
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.760]   It's wise or to create a place that is going to be safer
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.920]   However, what it looks like instead is exploitation of young people and it's just not smart
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.440]   I think you know, I think what Facebook would do is design it so that it doesn't collect data
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.240]   But that's not the only hazard go ahead. I'm sorry Stacy
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.320]   Well, no, it's not just well if they design it so they don't collect data
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.920]   How can they market to the children and they really want to make money? I mean there's from a
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.760]   If you are a company like Facebook or even Google
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.480]   There's no value in marketing to kids because you can't sell their information which is your core business model
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.640]   Which is probably why you don't have Saturday morning cartoons anymore, right?
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:25.320]   Do they not exist? I mean, well, you don't see him anymore. You don't see him anymore, and it's not because of
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.520]   Koppa, but it's because of earlier efforts to reduce advertising and children's TV
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.200]   And it's not that you're selling these data just just to be just to be precise here
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.880]   It's not because they're selling their data. It's their targeting the advertising to them
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.120]   It's marketing to them right and secondarily and hold on a second
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.600]   But secondarily I want to make sure this point gets in and the concern of some parents groups
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:54.560]   It hooks kids on Facebook at an early age, right? And that's strategic. It's a funnel into adult Facebook and Instagram
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.320]   That's probably the reason we are. What's the story? It's Stacy. Okay crazy story
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.960]   Type in why he man rides a big green cat
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.760]   The answer was back in the 80s when they built cartoons just to market stuff, but the
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.200]   FTC was like hey guys you have to have actual content. You can't just make marketing copy for kids
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.160]   The reason is the toy company that wanted to sell he man stuff Mattel
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Mattel had a
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:35.760]   Big green cat and they didn't want to pay for a better animal for he man. So they just they were like buddy
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.680]   Just use this big green cat. It's the best story. There it is
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.200]   Here is here's the story from Wikipedia while the decision was made for he man to have some sort of vehicle
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.000]   They no longer had the budget to be able to produce one the decision was then made to repurpose a tiger
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.560]   from the big gym toy line
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.840]   However, it wasn't the same scale as he man and compared to he man was about the size of a horse
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.760]   Cleveland
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.120]   however, the Paul Cleveland and vice president of Mattel marketing
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.400]   insisted it be used even after artist Tony Guerrero made a green version in an attempt to discourage Cleveland
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.180]   Who instead simply suggested putting a saddle on it was resulted in battle cats?
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.440]   final design
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.840]   Holy cow, so we have always compromised our
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:29.680]   Artistic and whatever principles we have in exchange for marketing and selling things at a profit. Yeah
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.720]   Although you one could argue he man was not exactly the
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.080]   pinnacle of art
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.040]   You know what it looks like you just stepped out of a German sauna
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   I
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.640]   Loved it and every time I see a he man
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.280]   Add or whatever it just it warms my heart
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.720]   But it also reminds me of my dad yelling at me waiting yell, but he always say I bet he did his push-ups today
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   Did you? Oh
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.520]   Because you grew up watching this
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.160]   When I watched he man and every time my dad knew I was watching it he would usually reference
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.800]   Did you do your push-ups? I'm glad he man did you didn't adopt the blonde page boy hairstyle?
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   Yeah, that would be no
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.480]   Let's get him away get a great big long
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:27.080]   Yeah, really I love that and I love Shira. Oh there she is
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.960]   He managed she ran
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.040]   No, no, that's not she that's not she runs. That's some like eagle-a-saucera
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.160]   sorcerer
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   Oh my god, I you know
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.960]   I'm glad if you watch them now you're like, oh my god. Yeah, it's hard to watch now
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.320]   I guess the point really is that you survived it a whole generation survived it
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.680]   But I did eat a lot of sugary cereals and asked my mom and I had castle grackel
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.200]   I had an entire she-ra set. I mean, but it didn't but it didn't in the long runs
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:09.120]   Pollute you did she still eats waffles. I don't believe in waffles. Maybe why I have a hotel and she and me and I don't know for all that
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.620]   I know I could blame that on he man
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.680]   a mini kidney
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.720]   I probably probably got it from the big Jim kidney set and they just didn't want to resize it
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.520]   To fit
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.220]   Anyway, good news Instagram has it as abandoned its plan to although
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.240]   Wall Street Journal not to be slowed in their role
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.040]   Continues with a Facebook's file Facebook's effort to attract preteens goes beyond
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.200]   Instagram kids documents show
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:50.320]   Exploring play dates as a growth lever. Holy cow
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.520]   Yeah, this is I mean you don't want to think about people
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.840]   I mean, I know people market to children. I will say the best thing about Anna's
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:09.160]   Have yeah, like because we had Netflix and things she didn't actually watch ads until like she was like six or seven
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.400]   but like
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.440]   It's very insidious
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.040]   like the idea that your children are going to be marketed to
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:23.840]   On a platform that also as they crow is going to make them question their self-worth. I mean, it's like
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.520]   You're not doing anything good for the kids actually McDonald's
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.480]   I just learned this to my great dismay has abandoned several years ago abandoned Ronald McDonald the clown
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.760]   Yeah, they did but they didn't do that because they were worried about
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.400]   Kid being influenced influencing kids they did it because they learned that kids were scared of clouds
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:47.880]   But no what I was saying that they marketed to kids with those arches
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:55.720]   Oh, and the anywhere happy meals, right and the playground and the playground and french fries
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.760]   Ladies and gentlemen and french fries. Well, no, I like french fries. Yeah, here's the slide
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.600]   from the
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   tweens competitive audit
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.120]   Source February 2020 Facebook presentation
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.260]   Why do we care about tweens? They are a valuable but untapped audience?
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.080]   Our ultimate now this again this slide is in the Wall Street Journal
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:23.720]   And is claimed to be from a leaker, but you know, we haven't seen the actual Facebook release
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.200]   Our ultimate goal the slide says is messaging
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.320]   primacy messaging primacy with us teens
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.160]   Which may also lead to winning with teens?
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.520]   So there you go. That's the funnel right there if we can get prime if we can get primacy and messaging with them when they're young
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.760]   They will continue using Facebook messenger and WhatsApp
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:51.080]   MK begins to lose PMF as kids age you're somebody's gonna have to interpret that for me
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.080]   MK North Korea starts to lose
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:03.000]   Our primacy Facebook said a kidnap kids from North Korea. That's it. Yeah, I got it MK
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.120]   Well, you know Google gets kids for Google classrooms because a lot of classrooms use it
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.440]   Right and then an apple they usually get apple devices at a certain income level
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:19.240]   So what you get is kids moving between those two platforms and Facebook on the messaging side loses out
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:26.600]   Our primacy declines at 10 and 82 percent of our users are 10 or younger
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.560]   In some products. I don't know what that is
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.520]   MK
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.840]   What's MK something kids? Oh kevin kevin says it's mini kidney
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.360]   Thank you kevin
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.600]   Kevin troll
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:53.480]   MK something kids it must be something they're doing to kids messenger kids. Oh, they do have a messenger for kids. Don't they?
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.960]   That's what they're talking about. Oh
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.680]   Speaks Facebook away a minute. I know mr. Regan said it in the chat as well messenger kids
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.640]   It's not just me loses PMF
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.400]   Which is some sort of you know primary marketing focus or something as kids age our primacy declines at 10
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.280]   How depressing and users are 10
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   80 percent of users are 10 or younger, but that all they're really saying is we don't get tweens
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.000]   So how do we get tweens? Here's a 10 year old boy from detroit quoted on the slide?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.120]   I don't think I would use it. That's just me
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.960]   I would have to get my mom's permission to connect my friends and everyone would make fun of me
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.480]   That's as if I was writing a big green cat
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:41.000]   I think I had and had plus in my ear
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.600]   Stop it. I put that mastoid back in many kidney
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:50.120]   Virtually
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.880]   Wall Street journal is is of course points out that virtually every major social media platform
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.840]   Including bike dance limited's tick-tock and youtube is confronted legal or regulatory problems related to how children use its products
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.880]   And you know everybody wants kids
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.360]   You know all broadcasting wants kids too because again the habit formed is
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   valuable
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.240]   Go ahead pet
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.160]   Is this a situation where facebook and instagram are damn if they do or in damn that they don't because
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.640]   They've already created this monster in their quotes and they're saying hey
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.920]   We want to try to fix this monster, but at the same time
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.240]   They're gonna be targeted because there are a monster and say hey well
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.520]   We don't want you to bring those same habits over to this new product that you're building for our kids
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.160]   Is it damn if you do damn if you don't for them
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.880]   I think you're right aunt, but it would have maybe worked six years ago
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.760]   given present situation
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.200]   um
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   starting to anything for kids
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.440]   Is just gonna get you attacked and rightfully so yeah, I think so we you know the other hand
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.520]   You know you're talking about the marketers perspective, right? If you're a kid
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.360]   You want to watch cartoons. You want to go. I love saturday morning. I was what you do you say?
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.320]   Right. Yeah, so you know can somebody
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.560]   Can somebody some my daughter went when when when american girl
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.640]   Had a social network that was there was very closely policed
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.160]   And it was wonderful and my daughter was there and then they killed it and she was she was just crestfallen
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.840]   I'm sure it was too expensive for them and the marketing value wasn't there
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:36.040]   Uh, but but kids do want this and the question is can somebody create something
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.000]   That has parental
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.280]   Control that that uh doesn't deal marketing
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:49.240]   Have created this kids like look at minecraft look at roblox look at board nine look at some
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.120]   Star-stable kids are gamers
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:23:05.500]   I don't know but look at played neo-d
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.640]   Well because you're paranoid. No, yeah
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.760]   Well, yeah
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   Yeah
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.960]   Uh
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.880]   Let's talk about russia
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.000]   Actually, it all starts with youtube banning and they announced this uh this week
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.200]   Any anti-vaccine?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.760]   websites including
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.480]   Robert f Kennedy jr. And yeah the very popular joseph murkola
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.080]   dr murkola is uh, you know sells his own
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:41.400]   Of varieties of vitamins and things but doesn't want you to get uh vaccinated
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.360]   Uh both have been knocked off of youtube
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.960]   Facebook banned misinformation on vaccine seven months ago, but they still have both kennedy and murkola
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.120]   Uh twitter both accounts are still active
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.800]   Uh, dr. murkola said I shouldn't call him a doctor. He's yeah, please. Yeah, he's not a
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.520]   Put air quotes right it's like it's like arizona
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.280]   Audit I think he's not as you nasa path. I think he's an austipath
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:16.600]   Mercola said he's being censored. Yeah, that's exactly what it's happening and said without presenting evidence that have vaccines had killed many people
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.040]   Kennedy also said he was being censored
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:26.440]   There's no instance in history when censorship and secrecy advanced has advanced either democracy or public health
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.520]   Well, that might be accurate. I don't know. I'd have to think about that
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.040]   More than a third of the world's part, but this is insensorship in the sense of government censorship
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:42.680]   This is just uh, uh, private website declining to allow you to promote your fallacious theories exactly
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.000]   Which seems okay to me
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.920]   Yeah
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.280]   Uh, I think we should say vaccines have proven to be overwhelmingly safe and effective in preventing disease
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.120]   Of all kinds by the way, this isn't covid vaccines
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.280]   It's all vaccines all vaccines
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.480]   So they're basically trying to do to stop the anti-vax movement
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.320]   So so that decision led them to also take down
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.000]   RT videos, which is russia today, which is
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.880]   Russian government's news service and in jeremy shall we air quotes again, please news
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.480]   It's really a propaganda service right uh, pose. Yes service. Although I suppose in russia
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.600]   They'd say the same about voice of america, but uh, I think it's pretty much a blatant propaganda service
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:36.680]   So youtube has shut down to german language channels. This is in germany managed by
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.440]   RT
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.240]   They were deleted after they published what youtube called misinformation about covid-19 and gronovirus
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:50.920]   Vaccines to which were the russians, uh russia's communications ministry rus common zor
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.200]   Said it sent a letter to google demanding that all restrictions on youtube channels rtde
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.000]   That's rt germany and der fen der philenda part, which means
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.800]   what the other story
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.400]   operated by russia media let russia today be lifted as soon as possible
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.720]   And the threat was to fully or partially restrict
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.680]   youtube and russia or find google if the channels are not restored
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.680]   So, uh, that's still pending this just happened
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:29.560]   russia has also by the way said google needs to ban content
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.000]   That we know at the same time we don't like
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.520]   A moscow court
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:42.440]   Find alphabet 6.5 million rubles, which is a mere $89 000 for not deleting content the russia deems
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.200]   illegal
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   remember though both apple and google have
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   deleted during the russian elections
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.840]   apps by from the opposition from navelny
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.120]   in response to russian requests so
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.880]   You know and part of the problem is that russia has a law that a lot of uh, it turns out a lot of uh,
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.080]   totalitarian
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.520]   regimes do this
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.520]   requiring these companies have
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.960]   In-country representatives employees that they can complain to and threaten to jail
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.400]   Uh in both google twitter facebook do that they've responded that way apple
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   Uh, so that
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.920]   Some people say think that this is part of the reason why apple and google are more amenable is they don't want these people to be
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.400]   thrown in the gulag
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.120]   russia it's interesting i don't i don't think russia
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.680]   We're not talking china here google walked away from a billion people in china
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.360]   russia
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   Is not a huge economic power not a huge market
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.640]   You could without much harm i think
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.240]   Could you not walk away from russia i wonder why they don't
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.840]   There are 144.4 million people in russia should you care?
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.520]   Yeah, it's it's uh, it's not a huge economy
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.960]   Uh
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   No, it's I know for a fact, especially
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   you know due to the politics and and uh
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.080]   You know that there guys prom their big russian
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.480]   oil company
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   Has been I think is somewhat
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.720]   Sanction under sanction right
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:25.560]   Or sanction because they're just like a kleptocracy for puttin is well because of the invasion of ukraine
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.760]   Um, yeah that too
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.000]   I don't know if i google the value of the russian economy to google
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:41.160]   So the russian entire russian stock market is worth 325 billion dollars google is worth 340 billion
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.360]   Dollars so in other words google is worth more than the entire value of the russian stock market
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.080]   in other words
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.800]   I think you could yeah, but I think you could walk away if google starts leaving
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.400]   starts
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.760]   Doesn't fight
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.400]   Starts leaving the countries where it's causing where they're closed trouble. Let's be clear
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.360]   They're not fighting the choices leave are not there leave or give up
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.880]   Right the only way you could fight is walk away
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.080]   Well
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.840]   Yeah, how do they get find 86 000 dollars and just keep going and keep doing the same thing
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   I guess they could do that they could afford to do that. Yeah
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:26.440]   In in russia though continuing to piss off the russian government does not have a good strategy for your people there. Yeah, it's
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.320]   Not a long term
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.240]   good strategy
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.520]   Anyway, I've just I've wondered myself for a while now why apple and google just kind of seemed to
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:41.320]   Bow down to pressure from the russian government. I guess I kind of understand from a
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:47.960]   Financial point of view why they might do what china asks them to do but russia's getting more and more
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.640]   um
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:55.080]   Aggressive about this stuff but it but they but the consistency is we follow the local laws right
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:02.520]   So that's where they're stuck is is except where we don't like them. Yeah, I think so, but okay
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:08.360]   That's hard but so they so taking down the rt in germany is not against the law
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.200]   That was probably that was an activity in germany in germany
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.960]   So the russians are also accusing germany of having to have the german government having
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   But what if russia then says okay, well, we're gonna find you and sanction you
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   For what you do in germany. Yeah, which they're threatening to do
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   Then what then what do you do google?
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.960]   You just pay the fine you keep paying the fine
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.680]   Or you don't pay the fine at all well they wait wait didn't you youtube
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.040]   uh
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   turkey
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:44.680]   Did youtube leave turkey shut down because it refused to go along for a while didn't it? Yeah, I think so
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.840]   So there is precedent here. Yeah
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.240]   I don't know I this all this is above my pay grant. I just thought I
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.160]   Mentioned those three stories because they're all kind of related
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:02.760]   All right, why don't I take a break and then the really the biggest story today and I know stacey was paying attention is
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.240]   Amazon's event in particular
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.000]   Astro the spy robot we will talk about that
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:19.240]   Actually it was designed to be a security robot. That's not I mean no spy, but
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.960]   Police officer in your heart it follows strangers around your house
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:31.080]   We'll talk about it. We'll talk about it. I mean a dog would do that, right
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.880]   Better not yeah
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.960]   Yeah, my dog would follow you around barking and trying to lick you. It's very confusing
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:45.160]   We know there and that's more than that they announced more than that actually amazon as usual with these product announcements and unfortunately
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.600]   They don't do us live streams. So I would be thrilled
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.320]   To sit down and you know snark over a live stream, but they don't do that
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.840]   Kevin and i said
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.160]   Yeah with each other we had a lovely
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.720]   Lovely time going back and forth so we can share some of that with you coming up
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:09.160]   We i knew that would be a highlight this week. I said, oh, I can't wait. I know as soon as I saw
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:16.920]   I said, I know what we're talking about our show today brought to you by a really excellent podcast from redhead
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   I love it the red hat
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:24.280]   Likes us enough to say hey, would you tell your audience about our podcasts and I think you would like this
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.880]   It's called command line heroes that gets you that gives you an idea
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:38.280]   It's the epic true tales of developers programmers hackers geeks open source rebels who are revolutionizing the technology
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.840]   Landscape the host of course is the wonderful serrania barrick
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.040]   I was just reading a new book program not a new book a 20th anniversary edition of a
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.800]   classic programming book called the prac pragmatic programmer
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.040]   And serran wrote the forward to it, which I thought was great
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.280]   she
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.440]   in command line heroes
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.600]   tackles a particular question
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.040]   This season it's the eighth season, which is amazing
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:12.440]   Uh, and they and it's all about this this season. It's all about robots love them
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:19.640]   Perfect timing. What is a robot? Is it a servant? Yes a factory worker? Yes a prosthetic
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.960]   He could be a vehicle. Absolutely
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.240]   A spy in your house. Well, I guess so
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.200]   Why do we build robots that look like us?
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.240]   Ever wonder about that and we often ask whether we can trust robots, but uh,
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.360]   Serran asks an interesting question can robots trust
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.120]   us
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.240]   Of course robots are the meat of many a science fiction story
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.480]   And we presume in the future they'll serve our every need
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:51.640]   Will they develop a mind of their own will they turn against us or will they be the savior of humanity?
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.280]   This is what it's all about season eight of command line heroes
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.240]   And it actually talks about the robots that are already in our midst
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.760]   And the determined dreamers were bringing them to life eight episodes in season eight
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.800]   comparing the science fiction
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:14.280]   Robots with the reality of robots today. You actually I have a little clip. Uh, this is from robots
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.560]   As a servant. Here's a little clip for you
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:25.160]   While making this season we discovered a robot reality that's pretty removed from the robots we imagined
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.760]   And yet all those misguided ideas about what a robot should be
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:36.280]   Actually shaped with robots are and no robot fiction shaped things
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.240]   More than the story we told ourselves about robotic servants
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:47.960]   Command line heroes season eight is out now. It's all about robots
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:53.640]   An award-winning podcast hosted by serran yabarach produced by red hat
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:59.000]   So you know it's gonna be good season eight is out now search for command line heroes on apple podcasts or anywhere
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.080]   You listen to podcasts and I will also put a link in the show notes for today's episode of twit.tv/twig
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   My thanks to command line heroes
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.960]   So much for their support. We love promoting other people's great podcasts
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.120]   Thank you serran and thank you command line heroes and thank you red hat
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   Just look for command line heroes in your favorite podcast player
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.400]   All right, so
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.040]   Uh, they do these events it feels like
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:32.760]   Uh, stacey every every few months amazon for the last four years. It's been every september
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   They've invited so this is the big one
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.760]   This is their big device launch although this year was
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.720]   Way fewer devices than normal
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.120]   and actually
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:51.000]   Fewer infrastructure launches. So I look at this as like a maturation of their strategy with just a few devices
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.720]   Way more services
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:36:01.000]   They're pushing they envelope forward on what they call ambient intelligence what we might think of as the smart home or
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:08.520]   It all kind of follows on screens it follows along with what they've been doing all along. There's more echoes. There's more ring
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   cameras
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.520]   Uh, there's a ring alarm pro system which takes another amazon product hero and
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.720]   incorporates that into the uh system
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:23.560]   I think the was there anything before we get to astro was there anything
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.920]   Particularly interesting to you and the things they announced
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:33.240]   There were really a couple things one the amazon glow, which was a video conferencing
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   Device for kids less so on the video conferencing front
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:42.280]   But more on what they have is a vertically oriented screen
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.840]   That kids can talk to people with
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.960]   Um, and then it has a projector coming out the front that projects things like games
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:57.240]   Oh, whatever. So the kids can play with someone on the other like on a place back in front of them. Yeah. Oh, it's not a place back
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   That's the actual projection
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:04.280]   Yeah, no, I know but it's it's on to some sort of place max sized thing in front of the kitty
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.880]   There's no way is a projection or it's or is it a camera taking an image of to share it?
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.600]   It is a projection of
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.800]   An image and that's actually not on a place met
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.000]   What's it on? Well, they're there. Okay. They may have a place met there, but they showed it also without a place
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.840]   Oh, you don't have to okay
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:29.800]   I think the device inside is actually from Bosch, but i'm not sure I saw this in 2018. It's c. Yes projection, right
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.480]   It it was a pico projector
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:39.480]   But the cool thing about it is you could actually interact with it which is different than most projections
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.720]   So you could actually create a touch screen with it
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:48.360]   Um, it also was really good because when you changed the distance the resolution didn't it didn't
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.440]   change
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.280]   So yeah, and it was it was actually a really cool device
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:00.520]   Um, anyway, so I was excited about this because we haven't seen projection in the smart home
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.200]   And it does there's a couple things that are interesting here
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.640]   We already saw voices being like, oh, we're all so high on voice and then we're like, oh, but we need a display
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.840]   And now we're looking at a different way to view a display
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.560]   And so I was really keen on this because I thought it was gonna be yeah
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.760]   I like this because a kid is gonna it's a little more like a book
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.080]   So grandma can be reading and the kids gonna see the projection of the page
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.720]   Uh in front of her
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.280]   This is gonna confuse
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.440]   This is gonna confuse the hell out of grandma
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:41.080]   Well grandma's gotta be somewhat literate, right? Yeah, I don't think grandma does it on a tablet. It looked like there's a tablet
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.560]   That you could use like an echo fire tablet that you would use to
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:52.040]   Yeah, I don't know what they're using on grandma's end. I really don't they might have it the same device on the other end
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.480]   It's unclear to me. Oh, okay. Yeah, it looks like she's talking to something like that. Yeah
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.520]   Yeah, because she's sitting up straight
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.840]   It's interesting 250 bucks
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.640]   Here's a video we can we can watch of of the kids running around
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:11.880]   I remember seeing you won't give me instagram. Yes. So give me this amazon thing. Oh, yeah, see the
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.280]   Holding of fire tablet. Yeah, I think this is kind of cool
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:23.320]   I think it's cool because I want to make projection mainstream of the harp in the smart home because I think there's so many
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:29.640]   Opportunities where you don't need a full display like you could just project something and interact with it
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:36.680]   Um, so that's one the other thing that I thought was cool other than the robot which we'll get to
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.920]   um
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.440]   Oh was okay amazon killed their care hub app
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.680]   Which was their service for aging in place and they introduced something called amazon
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:54.920]   Was it a lot together? I think it was a lot together and this is a 1999 a month subscription for aging in place
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.000]   But two neat things here and jeff you might appreciate this
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.800]   One is it gives you the ability to collaborate with someone else like if you have other family members monitoring
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:12.120]   Your parents maybe um beforehand. It was oh it was like me to my parent
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:17.800]   But I couldn't invite my brothers and sisters in so you could add more people and then two it gives you the ability to
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.880]   Sign your parents or whoever the care givvy is
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:28.360]   Up for things and to help them troubleshoot and add contacts and do things so they don't have to do it
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.320]   I don't know what the ability to set it up
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:36.440]   So like if you're if you gave your father an echo for example, you could share
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.080]   Everything that happens on that echo with you have a sister. Yes. Yes
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.520]   So you and your sister could be a reference account
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:50.760]   Okay, so that is new and then two like you could add like
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:57.000]   Your kids contact information to your dad's echo instead of having him do it
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.320]   You could add like oh I see so i could take it over. I kind of preset it
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:07.080]   Yeah, you could take it over and do something good because so just they made that's what kids are doing. Yeah, that's it
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.880]   That I mean we're all kind of trying to do something like that, but but with that support from amazon
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:17.160]   So it's good that they build this in. I think that's great question questions. Stacy. Yeah, does it does it?
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.280]   transcribe into text for deaf parents
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:28.600]   Does it transcribe into text? I think the echo did my son was looking at it. Jake was looking into this for just this reason
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.160]   um we find
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.000]   I'll tell you later about the hell on a spectrum
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   Um, I know about spectrum
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.120]   Oh
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.320]   God the worst most evil the work. I don't want to get
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.720]   I want I want I want I want I want to get a lot of devices to cover
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.800]   We had a we have a text phone now
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.000]   Where it'll transcribe us on the phone, but it'd be great to be able to see each other and have transcription
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.400]   Um google I think just that I don't know really your echoes did this
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:04.040]   Okay, okay. I will ask and find out for you later. Please do. Thank you. I'd be very great
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:10.280]   But I think everybody who has older parents or older family members is I set up an echo show for my mom
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   Uh so that for you know, but it was on my account and she reset it because she didn't want to see
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.160]   And it was like no, but mom now you have to set it up
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:24.520]   So it neat and apple did this with their watch too
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.800]   They had it finally you can set up an apple watch for somebody else
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:33.480]   A kid or an elder perhaps who doesn't have an iPhone, but you can set it up and so they get the benefits of that
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.320]   I think this is smart. So Stacy is this a different device or is this just a
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.040]   Service it's a monthly service
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:46.360]   The service also has the older care help stuff, which is like anytime your parent interacts with the echo
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.040]   You'll get a notice that says so and so played music
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:54.200]   They're alive. They're moving around. Yeah, what's the name of the service?
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:01.160]   It's either a lot together or amazon together. Hold on. Okay. Okay, that's that's close enough
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.040]   I think it's a like together and uh because I'm just like so together. Yes
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.680]   Uh, I think that sounds interesting. It's an elder care subscription service basically
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.240]   So there's there's another one. So
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:18.280]   Grandpad it's uh you sign up early enjoy six months of service for free limited time offer
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.400]   $20 show the screen place $20 build monthly
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.360]   $199 annually
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.240]   So it is expensive, but I guess which is much less expensive than the competitor, which is grand pad
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.760]   Which is a really neat device. Oh, yeah, so they asked me about that on the radio show. That is uh how much is here?
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   Oh, it's really a month. Yeah
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.400]   690
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.640]   Have you tried the grand pad because I somebody asked me about that on the radio show?
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.200]   No, my somebody recommended to my sister. I was thinking about I'm I'm shopping. I think it's overpriced
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.800]   I think it's overpriced
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:55.240]   So this is yeah, you're right 20 bucks a month is a lot more reasonable. You obviously have to buy an echo
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:03.640]   Yeah, and they can actually call out in dial either a emergency services through this or they can just like call you jeff
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.000]   Yeah
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.720]   Yeah, I'm gonna have my mom called jeff if there's a
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.600]   This one is this already available for order
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.320]   um the service
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.160]   The service is not yet out. It says email me when released
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.800]   And the name again is hello
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.920]   Together
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   What's the together? Thank you
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:30.840]   Um, this is a really good idea. Uh, it's simpler than the granddad pad or grand pad
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.400]   Grandpad
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.840]   But but but but but but
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.520]   But yeah, so simpler if simpler means fewer ways to screw it up
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.600]   Uh
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.000]   No, in fact, I would say it's more complicated to set up
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.720]   But it doesn't do as many things as the grand pad
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.760]   Does because the grand pad has a button, you know, if you want to call the grandkids
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.600]   There's a button on it says tat it's a tablet. There's a button on the screen and you just press it
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.240]   And you could do the multi person zoom calls by just pressing buttons and things like that
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.960]   This isn't really so this you just shout at it. Yeah. Hey jeff
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.640]   Hey
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:13.240]   Although then you get the the a little issue from the sl also a professionally staffed
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.200]   24/7 urgent response team
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:23.000]   So yes, that's what I was saying. So if you had an emergency, you could call someone doesn't have to just be they don't just call jeff
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.560]   They can call right
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.720]   And what do you expect me to do like huh?
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:35.400]   Most old people like I shouldn't say most old people but many like I know my mom would never call emergency services
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.720]   She would want to call actually I could picture her just laying there not wanting to trouble someone
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.520]   But like she would be more likely to trouble me than this is phenomenal
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.320]   If you're a loved one allows it you can set a reminder on their phone
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.960]   For take your pills mom or managing shopping lists
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.640]   That's this is really a good idea or if they're too old to
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.120]   To do a phone we we bought
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.840]   Um, you know one of the simple phones
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:07.080]   And right done with big buttons and just and we didn't even open the box. We just talked about work
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:12.520]   Well, I bet you could have the echo also say take you you could drop in on them on the echo or the echo could be like a
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.920]   Reminder. Oh, yeah, but if you can get them to carry a phone. There's fall detection response
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:23.000]   Oh, yeah, I'd love it if we could yeah, yeah, they're working with viar. That's really awesome
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.560]   What's the viar? That is
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:31.640]   Viar is a 60 giga hertz radar company out of israel and that's a I didn't even see that
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.760]   So these are fall detection devices sky angel cares another
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:40.680]   So if a fall is detected the echo will ask your loved one if they need help
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.520]   Then connect to the urgent response line and alert emergency context
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:50.360]   This is uh, you know, you're gonna see more and more of this stuff with the as as we the boomers age
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:56.280]   And you the I thought you were gonna say as we incorporate more rf sensing into devices and that
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.880]   And as you act poor gen xers
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.640]   Have older and older parents that you need to take care of and the thing is
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.960]   Are you're not necessarily near and I noticed that's a big component of this
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.480]   This is this is for me and my mom who's in rD island
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.640]   So it's interesting to ask you at the end. I'm signing up for the the notification now
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.000]   So there's there's five reasons why are you interested? So this is what they're marketing
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.240]   One customized alert notifications for daily activity take your pills, mom
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   Two 24 seven hands free access for your loved one to trained agents just discussed
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:34.360]   Three circle of support allows multiple family members to stay in the loop and help provide support
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.240]   But you you touted another thing as important for remote assist allows you to manage device settings
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.720]   Yeah, pa hit that button doesn't work
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.800]   And then five fall detection with compatible devices called urgent response
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.320]   This is nice
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.360]   Okay, a lot of this won't be available till early next year
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:58.440]   But yeah, that's that's common in these I think that's really good. So other things they announced. Yeah is a fit
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.760]   Lookin device. It's the hate. That's the next generation halo with a screen
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.600]   they also announced a $60 thermostat that
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.200]   is interesting only because it's cheaper than any other smart thermostat out there and
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.920]   Amazon's a lot of fun was a big investor in eco B and I'm like, oh
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:22.760]   They also announced the 15 inch echo show. This is a big
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:31.880]   They did it as a and then as part of that they announced Alexa widgets, which is little like sticky notes calendar weather
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:38.200]   I was really excited about this as a potential to like control all of your smart home devices and see like all of your camera feeds
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.680]   But I don't think it's powerful enough to drive all of that
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:49.160]   So i'm kind of sad about that, but you can see like a few things and control a few things the echo show 15 is only 250 bucks
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.600]   That's really interesting. So it's not much more expensive than the the countertop
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:59.000]   It's a normal echo show, but it's a big old screen. You could hang on your wall
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.920]   It also comes with a stand if you don't want to hang it on your wall. I'm tempted. We love our echo show
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   Oh, you can even do it in portrait mode. It's really fat. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it looks fat
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:13.160]   Are you saying something? I think it's attractive is the heart heart. It is not
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:19.720]   Are you bottles body shaving the Amazon echo show? It's a little hardware shaming the echo shows. Yes, well
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:23.320]   Given that price, I'm not surprised. I mean you're not getting a top of the line
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.160]   You know, yeah, Kevin said it looked like the world 2019
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.120]   So leo make your call
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.840]   Yeah, it doesn't work
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.040]   I mean the price is very is surprisingly low
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:41.160]   Available later this year. This is all part of their new. Is this another day one? This is
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.840]   250 bucks. This is not day one. This is no
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.120]   Okay, the drone camera is one of their day one
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.040]   We should so we talked about this always home cam
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:57.880]   I thought by now they would have given up on this. This is the camera that flies out of the base
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.760]   To look around your house 250 bucks carrying cats to death. I just
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.080]   So some of the day one stuff is really highly experimental, right?
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:13.560]   Yeah, when you sign up for this it asks you things like how tall are your ceilings? Do you have giant walls of mirrors or glass?
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.920]   Are there multiple floors in your house? Are yours, you know, in are your ceiling?
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:25.720]   What the heck is that?
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.720]   It's coming for me
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:36.760]   Oh my gosh, just imagine a Facebook made this oh you can carry it around. Why would you carry it? Why would you do that?
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.760]   Oh, are you teaching at your house?
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.480]   Yeah, oh my god
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:48.440]   This is so terminated Amazon Amazon put a lot of effort into this is really important actually
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:51.400]   AI some of it locals
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:57.000]   So now they actually have their voice processing chip will do your utterances for a
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.680]   On the edge so locally on the device. So that's a big deal
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.280]   to
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:09.960]   They announced that you can now teach things like from a computer vision perspective from a sound perspective
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.080]   And also your personal like personal habits perspective and this is important
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.160]   Why is actually said they're going to do this as well?
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:23.240]   Google has this capability but hasn't really focused on doing much with it because I think they were worried about privacy
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.280]   Um, so like you can teach a
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.040]   What your washing machine sounds like when the chime goes off
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:35.640]   And then it will notify you that like your wash is done, which is something people ask me for all the time
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   Um, you can teach it your best to listen all the time
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.920]   It also apparently has a seth rogan mode
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.200]   Where if seth rogan tries to break into your house
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.240]   It'll come and chase them away, which I think is
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.160]   It's pretty cool. I like talking about seriously cool
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:52:07.480]   Something that chases seth rogan away from your stuff. I just that's not that throw good. Oh, okay. I mistake. I'm mistaken then
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.960]   Then it's less interesting
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.320]   Um, so would you buy this easy would you buy this?
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:20.200]   Drone so I signed up for it because I'm very curious about it. It's your job
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.440]   Something I would actually buy if it wasn't my job. Yeah
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:27.400]   Yeah, you just could add up. I'm I'm now a little tempted because
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:33.720]   So let's talk about astro the robot. All right. Let's get to the everyone one more question. I am. Would you ever buy it?
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   No because of pets
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.840]   And I know they tried to put all of this fail safe. They could watch your pet though. You could check up on your pet
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   You know, but you didn't miss your pet
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:54.280]   No, but have you on that biscuit that dude tries to attack anything that moves. I don't care what you definitely don't want to get astro the robot
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:53:00.840]   So I know they try to put the old thing. The drug is above the dog. It's not going to be near the dog
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:08.760]   But that dog will chase it. He will jump at it. I'm I'm positive it it'll eventually be a mess in my scenario
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.400]   We have a video coming up. I just put the rundown later on of a dog
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.280]   You want us to show the Raven video again?
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.000]   No
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   I debated
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.560]   I knew you would say that
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.720]   Yeah
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:30.680]   I have something I have two videos that are better better than the rain
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:35.640]   You just wait nervous all right
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.560]   All right, let's talk about astro
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.560]   The thousand dollar now this one's a little more expensive
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:51.000]   Uh the robot which like a lot of look, you know, we had an advertiser. It was actually Bosch
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.600]   That uh was advertising a robot. They never made they gave everybody their money back
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.200]   Um, there's been a lot of companies making home robots none of which seem to do much
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.160]   This is no different
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:08.920]   I don't know if you've done anything either. So this is the astro
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.680]   Here's a motherboard article in which they talked to some developers
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:18.280]   One of whom says astro is terrible. Wait, I gotta read you the quote
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:26.040]   It will throw itself down any flight of stairs exactly
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.560]   Exactly
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.640]   um
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.520]   Astra is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.400]   The person detection is unreliable at best
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.680]   Making the in-home security proposition laughable
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.600]   The device feels fragile for something with an absurd cost
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:52.520]   The mast has broken on several devices locking itself in the extended or retracted position
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.400]   And there's no way to ship it to amazon when that happens
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:00.520]   Um now now admittedly this is a guy who did work on it
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:06.600]   It's not currently working on it. Maybe the early prototypes weren't as good as the the version they're going to sell, etc, etc
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:12.680]   Okay, so stacey tell us uh what astro. How did amazon pitch astro?
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.480]   So amazon's big
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:20.360]   I should tell you the big overarching theme of the presentation was ambient intelligence
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:27.800]   They said this phrase like 15 to 20 times throughout the entire hour. It was just everybody. That was their their thing
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.400]   and
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.600]   The idea here is that your home is becoming smarter
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.320]   And and we're all for that usually the way amazon's doing it's a little freaky but
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.840]   so
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:45.400]   Astros ambient intelligence is that it can roam around because you have all these devices and they can gather some intelligence
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.000]   But they're they're physically stuck. So this and the drone are designed to
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.040]   Amazon pitch it is something that can wander around your house and check things out for you
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.000]   It's kind of like a fire fire tablet on a on a stick extensible stick
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.640]   With wheels so it's like a tablet on the floor to use it. Well, no, I don't go out
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.920]   Okay, no, no, no, no
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.760]   So it will roll around your house at one meter per second, which is really fast
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:12.200]   Um, and it also has a periscope camera on it
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:17.640]   And then you can see it
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.640]   The keyhole or your bedroom
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.760]   Yeah, so it's basically like hey
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:27.400]   You know, did I leave the the stove on? I guess you could walk around
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:31.320]   Check out the window. It has a cup holder in the back
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.720]   It has a cup holder
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:41.080]   Yeah, if I were in the kitchen, I could send someone drinks and you could say that it knows people so you could say send Andrew this beer
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.520]   Oh, there it is. It's gonna dock. Okay, it's docking
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:49.640]   It could only work on one floor. They did a lot of effort talking about like hey, it's cute
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:54.120]   It reminds me of actually a donkey vector if y'all remember that robot. Yeah, it's super cute
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:57:01.080]   It sounds not quite as good as the eyes of the onky, but okay. No, but it's it's it sounds a lot like the onky
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.960]   um, and you know, it's
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:07.400]   I don't think for a thousand dollars
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.080]   There is a pressing need for a security perspective
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:19.080]   Um, I do wonder if with its quote unquote personality and some of the features if it might become kind of like, you know
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:23.880]   How iBO really made a lot of lonely people happier by being kind of personable with them
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   All right, I do wonder if this could
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:33.560]   Have that role because there is they also talked about it from the aging and place perspective like you could say hey go find grandpa
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:37.960]   So if you wanted your dad to take his pills, Jeff, you could be like go find dad
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.440]   It goes and rolls up to him and then you say dad take your pills. Yeah
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:50.520]   So that's it that's but it's way too early. I hate that amazon is like
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   Hey pay a thousand dollars for a well, there's early adopters
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.040]   Adoptors in the world who will I mean a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah, they know are you
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:05.160]   This reminds me so much of the Bosch a robot that we did
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:11.560]   I was that not gebo. I think it was or no we have a gebo that that was static
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.600]   um, oh, yeah, the name of the Bosch
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:18.200]   Robot
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   Pad on a stick that rolled around
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.000]   Yeah, actually still exists
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:29.720]   Yeah, yeah, no, they've gotten better and better we I gave that to somebody because it was an outdated device because they uh
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:36.520]   Oh, what was the name of that sponsor we had a gosh. I can't remember anybody remember. I can't remember off the top of my head but
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.360]   We brought oh mixtape mickey rockster
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:46.600]   Okay, the fact that there are so many names tells you something. This is a product category rockster is there back
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.560]   But he's trying to get curry. That's it
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:53.080]   The curry I got you. Yeah
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:59:00.840]   Um, and it was being I went down to see it and it was being developed and the real problem was it with it was
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:07.080]   It didn't really do anything. It was it was able to wander around
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:11.720]   But it just didn't it didn't do anything. That's the same here
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:18.120]   I mean this robot will recognize your face theoretically although it sounds like it has problems with that, but I mean
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:23.400]   It's not gonna fold your laundry. It doesn't even vacuum your floors. It's it's not gonna
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.400]   You know, so
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.280]   But it will turn you on. Oh, I'm so sorry. Y'all
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:35.320]   Being like a surveillance kind of so when gadget says that amazon is turning into a personal security company
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:41.000]   You have all the stuff up is that is that no? I mean that no amazon is so many things. It's
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.760]   I know a suite a suite of personal security things. Yeah, well, that's part of a sweet. Well, what was that phrase they kept saying?
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:52.520]   It's a ambient intelligence computing. Yeah, that's I think more to the point
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.320]   then security well
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:02.360]   And I wonder remember when the amazon look camera came out and they used that actually to gather so much data about like outfits and fashion
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.640]   And then they launched their own fashion clothing line
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.920]   Um, I kind of wonder if this is a way for amazon to get a lot of data
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:18.520]   Casual data about what lives in people's homes like I mean, I don't think it's necessarily nefarious exactly
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:23.320]   But this is always gonna be amazon's problem. You know that my child has this type of backpack
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.960]   Yeah, I think they're doing that. I have this type of appliances because there's a lot of information
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:33.800]   The hazard for them would be so great of doing that. Oh, I bet. I can't hear you. That's what I thought
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.160]   She's turned me off
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:43.320]   Okay, ask again
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:49.240]   I I don't think they're doing that because if they got caught doing that it would be such a problem
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:55.320]   But I don't think they need to do that to get value out of this. I think pro to the partly what they're trying to do is
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:59.400]   Desperately figuring out how this can be of use
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:06.680]   They want to be they think this is going to be the next big thing and I think echo has shown that there's a that there is a valuable market
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.800]   And they're just expanding that that's that's really interesting. It's going to be hard for them. You're
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.960]   Think about it understanding the number of rooms in your house and gathering
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.960]   I mean they can gather state from smart things because they already know like my
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.920]   I remember they got a lot of trouble for mapping, but that's how you have to do it because you can't
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:31.800]   Do not share that information with Amazon. They just shared the fact that you have a kitchen
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.360]   They shared it with themselves
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:42.280]   So people people are very concerned about this and that's going to really hamper Amazon's ability to do these kinds of products because of the privacy issue
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.360]   Yes and no
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   I think if they can offer sufficient value
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.320]   So I have an iRobot that maps my house and I freaking love it
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.880]   And I don't care that they know exactly what my house looks like because they do things like say hey
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:01.240]   This is by your kitchen counter. Do you want to set up a vacuum here because it's constantly dirty and I'm like
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.720]   Thank you. Yes, and they're like hey, this looks like it's under your couch
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.800]   Do you want to vacuum here more often?
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:15.320]   I mean those are things like if Amazon can deliver you value by like having their robot roam around your home and understand
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.120]   Like this is the lighting preference that Stacy has let me create an automatic routine for her
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.200]   Those are going to be hugely valuable to people and I think the question is
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.640]   How do technologists and engineers?
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.840]   Communicate the value of that data to people and build trust in the consumer
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:40.120]   So they're willing to share that data and honestly Amazon isn't there yet. I I would like the idea of this
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.000]   Yeah
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   I do like the idea that you mentioned about it
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:54.440]   Being a little personable for people that that are lonely because quite frankly people are spending a thousand dollars for dogs to just
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.360]   Follow them around but it talks an actual living thing as opposed to
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.560]   They don't do much
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.640]   And they've got a lot of effort and snores and farts and you know he
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.200]   That's why you're lonely. That's really thing
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.840]   I think I think honestly what Amazon's doing is really interesting and powerful
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.000]   Just as I thought sidewalk was really interesting and powerful and I think it's probably
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.680]   uh
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.680]   dead on arrival because people
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.720]   If just imagine if facebook did all this stuff
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.160]   People would go crazy. Amazon's almost as bad in people's minds. I think I know a lot of people
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.960]   Yeah, you don't have any echo shows or echoes in your house, right? Because you don't want echoes listening
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.600]   No, sir. I think you're very I think you
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:48.360]   All I have is the phone because that's enough listening devices in here. It's just these phones. That's it
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.800]   So it's going to be a battle between your thesis Stacy
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:57.080]   Which is that these are valuable enough people overlook the privacy angle. I'm sure that's what amazon's hoping
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.640]   Well, amazon's getting better at privacy. So there's a couple things to note here
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.760]   Amazon is doing a lot for privacy
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:10.520]   But you also have to ask yourself amazon is also not a trustworthy company
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.760]   Even if they're protecting my individual privacy because as a macro level
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.480]   They're using data in ways that hurt people, right?
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.280]   So there's that's a really subtle distinction that people aren't necessarily making yet
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:26.440]   And I don't know if I don't know if they should. I mean, I
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.040]   Ethically, I have a lot of problems with what amazon does. So
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:35.160]   Am I not part of their smart home ecosystem because I don't want to be complicit in that?
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.520]   Am I complicit in it if I like have a ring doorbell? Yes
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.080]   Those are hard questions and I don't think any consumers are thinking about them
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.880]   Uh, so the value they offer some good stuff, but at what cost
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:53.720]   And it may be that they're cheap that the group they aren't cheap. I can't believe 250 bucks for this 15 inch
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.640]   Display
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   I mean, that's kind of mind-boggling
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.480]   um
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.240]   I think their
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.080]   Commercial success proves that people aren't as worried that the people in our circles
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.440]   Are everybody I talked to all of our fans and all of our hosts
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:15.880]   Are terrified, but I think normal people probably aren't not all there's one who has no moral panic
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.760]   I just wish that thing would do more
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.840]   You know, it's just well if you had an echo okay, but if you had an echo show
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:29.720]   You would say that this 15 inch echo show screen. This replaces the family bulletin board. I mean, this is really great
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.080]   Okay, but you won't have one of these in your house, right?
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.440]   There's got to be an alternative if I just want a family bulletin board
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:43.880]   It's less useful though. See this more useful than the bulletin board because the camera says oh, that's Andrew
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.680]   And then you put up the posted note that you wrote for Andrew
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.440]   Uh watch out for the robot. It's about to steal your
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.880]   You could put that up
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:59.720]   And uh, I mean, I think that that's really cool it they look at they they're even selling it this way leave each other sticking notes
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:04.280]   Update shopping listen to lulis she see your shared and individual calendars
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.880]   This is this is clearly to replace the family bulletin board and I think with much more functionality
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:14.520]   Yeah, that's cool. I think and for 250 bucks
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:20.360]   I think it's pretty interesting to it to make those things happen right like if you had to go into the old lab
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:26.360]   It would be a no everybody no go. Yeah, just saying hey, i'll tell Andrew to you know walk the dog
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:33.560]   Okay, put a sticky note on that starts to sell. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think this is a
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:38.600]   Of all of them sounds the most interesting. I don't think think the robot we're gonna see a lot of companies
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.840]   Kind of working on making these robots more useful
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:49.480]   There's a there's a physicality problem and maybe only boston dynamics will be able to make a robot that can really gets things
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:57.240]   You know wash your dishes and stuff. I for one more 14 grand. Yeah, minimics in my house. Yes, but but astro is all part of the
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.880]   evolution of this
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:04.360]   Over time and to get people comfortable. That's what uh, that's what boss was saying about curry
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:10.200]   The whole idea was to get people comfortable. This in fact in the ad copy we would say things like
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:16.520]   Uh, this is your child's first experience of something that they're going to grow up with which is home robots
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.480]   So give them a good experience, you know, right?
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.520]   The one thing I will say is the toyota robots
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:30.120]   I mean so astros wake cuter compared to like toyotas robots for the home, which do wash your dishes
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:36.920]   But they hang from a gantry on your ceiling and they're just like these giant arms reaching down. I mean, that's terrifying
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.960]   It is not scary at all. So compare this
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:45.480]   This is and by the way, bosh, uh had a company called mayfield robotics. They were the uh advertiser
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:52.120]   So compare this to what this is five four or five years ago. What amazon was doing with astro. This is very
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.080]   Similar if you ask me down to the eyes remember this we did ads for it
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:00.760]   And the and it didn't and I kept saying well, what does it do nothing?
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:06.120]   It will play music for you to walk around. I think it's a it's almost identical idea
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:13.960]   Uh, yeah, this one's audio of curate or of um astro. No, should I get some audio? Yeah, there probably is
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:18.280]   Have audio that you should hear it. It's very it's very onker vector like
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.720]   Okay, what's onker vector?
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:27.800]   Rama onky. Sorry onky vector. Oh the onky vector onky those onky's were really cute
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.040]   Yeah, yeah, so let me play the let me because i've been leaving the audio off
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.120]   Let me let's let's do the ad with the audio
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.920]   If you will john
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.200]   astro
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.440]   This is ant and queen following me after he's been brainwashing to get him when it worked
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.040]   I like the uh
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.600]   The et music. I mean this is very cut intentionally spielburgish music
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   I like the sound yeah
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:09:00.120]   Okay, the sound helps you're right until I heard the sound but you don't want grandma on the floor following you around
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.360]   That's too weird
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.000]   Grandma might like I don't think that's weird at all
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.760]   I thought that the screen would grow up in the air. Yeah, but the camera only the camera goes up
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.920]   The screen's always at your ankle level
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.720]   Yeah, the screen would be hard. Yeah, no, I mean, that's that's a expensive proposition
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.760]   So you did dog
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.760]   All right, you've replaced me
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:25.160]   Yeah
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:32.120]   Very much like curry curry made cute sounds curry talk to you driving give it up. This is maybe a little bit closer
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.480]   So imagine this plus a
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.840]   Together
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.560]   Right, and you know you can see where they're going with something like this for
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:46.120]   Of course the first thing I asked him is is curry gonna throw itself down the stairs and they said no no no
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.360]   It has edge detection. It's not gonna it it it doesn't you know
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.080]   Actually these things have a little bit more difficulty getting over
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:59.960]   Uh like bumps in the floor like door door jams and things like that
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.640]   But I think this has got pretty big wheels. It probably could get around. I don't know
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.360]   It has two big wheels and one tiny wheel. Yeah
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:12.840]   And it goes really fast. Yeah meter a second is extremely fast
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.400]   So
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.920]   So it does make these sounds which are interesting
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:27.080]   So then what do you do all right, so there's raccoon. Yeah, that's always oh you got a alarm though
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.000]   No
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.400]   No, it runs a little spritzer to get my dog off the couch
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.840]   And this is how you win over the significant other bring him a beer. Oh, okay
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.520]   They also have a deal with furby, which is the pet company
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.160]   and
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.920]   They um, furby will dispense trees into the astro and then deliver it to your dog
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.280]   Wait a minute say that again
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.680]   They have a deal with furby the pet
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.480]   camera and treat dispenser
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.640]   Furby will distribute
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:09.880]   Treats to your dog or to the astro and astro can bring it to your dog. It bribes the dog
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.240]   Basically, yes. Oh my god
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.720]   This is scary
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.760]   When I search for furby astro demo. I got demonic furby astro demon
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.640]   So I don't I think
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.640]   That's something else
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.640]   Those are the
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.280]   Hold on. I may have the furbo furbo
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.160]   Furbo
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.040]   Can't google it if you don't have the name right furbo astro. Thank you. So, okay
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:49.960]   Uh, yeah, furbo dog camera. It can slot into the back of astro
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:56.120]   It can hold the furbo dog camera. Oh, wow. So it could follow your dog around look
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.600]   There is the meeting of minds
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.520]   The beat as Shakespeare would have said the beast with two backs a
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.520]   F
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:11.000]   And that the furbo shoots treats out a furbo treat shooting device on the back
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.560]   Now we know why they got a cup holder
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.280]   Holy cow
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.200]   They they actually sell those little containers in the back are
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.200]   What are they called?
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.800]   There's multiple types cup holders a container. There's one with a blood pressure cuff
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.720]   Um, so there's lots of options if I were a tick-tock
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:37.000]   Celebrity I'd immediately buy this the two of them together and do a series of videos of shooting dog treats
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.400]   As I drove around down
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.480]   Just I will say my dog is really mad at me right now
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:48.200]   Oh, why I've said the T word several times and she is like what the heck
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:54.200]   This is like waiting. What's the T word treat t-r-e-t-o
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.800]   That's the h-g to a dannable. Yeah, pretty much treat
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.120]   Lisa has discovered that if you shake the treat bag the cats come running
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.440]   So she's finally got away to herd cats that too. That's pretty good
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.240]   All right. We got more plural
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.640]   We have two. Yeah. Oh, I know that. Yeah, well while you're on this while you're on this
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:20.360]   Why don't we're just just because it's it's relevant. Maybe go look at line 42 line
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.000]   42
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.680]   Ego the pet
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.720]   cat caught on
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.920]   Nest cam videos of pets. We love to see
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:36.760]   And it's from google it's from google so it's okay to play this
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.440]   What will they do when we're away the dog climbed the tree
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.320]   Oh
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:48.200]   Pig coming in house
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.600]   peacocks raccoons kiddies
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.240]   Dog eating a bunch cake cat pulling on furniture
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.160]   Keep your eye and your pets with nest cam. That's good. That's good advertising. Oh
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:08.520]   Back from the break we can look at the frightening version of it. Okay, we will
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:11.800]   Is there anything else from the amazon event we want to uh
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.120]   They did a deal with disney if you care about uh,
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:22.440]   Yeah, we'll have a service called hay disney that is built on Alexa as the back end so
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:30.120]   Amazon has turned Alexa into service as we always knew she would or it would I have to say I don't know why google hasn't done this with their nest
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:36.120]   Stuff but I I have so many voices now. I have multiple personalities on my echoes
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.360]   I've got samuel jackson melissa mccarthy is so rare. I got everybody
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:45.640]   Come not as a right, but I got everybody coming out of there and it's fun. Who has different voices
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.360]   Yeah
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.400]   They have like
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.440]   Cyan they did did they do who did john legend was that google or was that amazon
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.920]   Amazon seems to really get the idea of putting in celebrity voices
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.640]   And I love it because I in the morning. I'll ask
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.200]   Sometimes if I'm in a rough mood I'll ask samuel jackson for the weather and he swears at me
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.720]   Or I'll ask melissa mccarthy for the weather and she just
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.360]   unicorns and rainbows. It's pretty funny and ziggy the new voice ziggy
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.880]   anyway, um anything else so uh
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.000]   That's a lot. That's a lot. It's good stuff. I'm interested
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.040]   I just wonder podcast tomorrow
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:33.480]   I'm what is all this and I have an toth or an toth who is the director of elixir trust talking about how they be perfect
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.640]   So there you go. That's what they're gonna have to be very aggressive about. Yeah
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:44.760]   Uh, that's the iot podcast you can hear it on your favorite podcast client or go to stsi
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:51.400]   Dot com. No, not at all. I'm glad to promote it. So kevin and uh stacey will talk to
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.200]   the woman in charge of amazon trust
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.440]   Wow
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:01.720]   That's really yeah, she wasn't super forthcoming about lots of things, but you can see where they're going
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:07.240]   Yeah, shocking. Well, I think the challenge is how do you convince people that all these
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.480]   Amazon cameras are not phoning home with stuff, you know
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.440]   About my sex life or whatever. We talk about that. Yeah
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.800]   Uh, let's uh take a little time out and when we come back the evil
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.240]   side of the camera
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.240]   All right, jeff explain this
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.720]   Explain this to me
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.040]   This is uh an alligator
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.520]   Well, this is not evil. It's just it's just scary. Okay. This is uh florida man

[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:05.000]   No, you need steel toe shoes when dealing with alligator

[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.160]   Everybody's cheering
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.040]   Sitting is the last thing I do on that
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.200]   This is a um
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   Actual problem in uh in the florida
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:43.720]   They uh, someone did come in the comments and say you should never do this and they heard the alligator and this alligator
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.280]   Capture services. Yeah, there come
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:50.440]   There's a nice lady will come with a little lasso and she'll come and she'll snag him
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:54.280]   This makes quite the moment on social. I love the the kibbitzing
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.920]   It's got the whole neighborhood. Yeah, this is not nice to the alligator
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:04.040]   No, don't office. I use it's stupid. It seems like you're asking for trouble because if the alligator
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.440]   Oh, man, it's gonna go very different. This could have gone bad
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   Look at the tail
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:16.920]   I mean look how much he's fighting to get that up. That's heavy and now what do you do?
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.720]   Now what?
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.440]   Recycling calling him a controller. He just put on the circle. You put on the curve and let the uh
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.920]   Let the garbage man handle it
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.480]   Oh
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.000]   Jeez
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   All right as long as we're playing tweets
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.480]   It's almost as bad as playing tiktok
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:41.400]   Here is a seeing eye robot. This looks like it's a Boston dynamics, but it's not it's a hybrid robotics
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.360]   Let's turn the sound on on this
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.320]   Researchers at UC Berkeley's hybrid robotics group
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.560]   At oh the guy he has a blindfold on this is a
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.400]   Crodripetal robot that works like a guide dog
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:01.800]   Oh, that's really interesting. All right. It's like a Roomba with the legs
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.960]   Oh
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.040]   All right, we have a little more an astro video is not
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:11.320]   Uh accessible to the blind which is yeah, not great, but yeah
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.720]   All right
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.320]   Let us move on to more weighty matters
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:26.120]   What did google do? I think google did what would what would they do?
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.440]   Uh
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:37.080]   Google plans to overturn the EU's $5 billion antitrust decision on android
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:44.280]   Uh, it could get worse. You know saying basically hey, what about apple? Yeah, yeah
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.160]   Uh that that could go up so
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.440]   Risky while the appeal is underway
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:59.000]   Google has had to comply with the decision offering all users of new android phones in the EU a choice screen of alternative search engines
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.880]   That's not a good experience for anybody
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.800]   But so far Google's market share for search on mobile has remained stable
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.200]   Have you guys noticed an uptick in approved the cookies clicks?
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:19.080]   More than ever it's just I've gotten used to it because it started two years ago. So I know but it's I think it's gotten worse aunt
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.480]   Oh
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:27.080]   Thank you. You go in and you tell it to decline all and all that good stuff. It's yeah, it's annoying
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.040]   Oh, I should accept the ball screw up. There is a
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:36.520]   Plug in I use and unfortunately it only works on max and on safaris actually it only works on safari and ipad
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:42.200]   iPhone or mac called hush the entire intent of it is to block
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:49.240]   The cookie thing and the and the thing that pops up on stacy's website that says subscribe to my newsletter
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.240]   No, no stacy from the ceiling
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:00.840]   Sorry, it works. Yeah, no, it's fine. I don't care. I just so does hush
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.800]   so
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.680]   I have no problems with that
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.680]   I I get it although I say
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.720]   I don't use your data for anything
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.360]   No, no
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.520]   I'm just gonna do a newsletter the only problem I have with it is I subscribe to your newsletter
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:23.960]   So I don't I but I know it. It's so annoying. There's no way to connect the two. I understand so
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:28.760]   You're gonna get it even if you've already subscribed not without being super intrusive on your data
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:32.520]   Right because then they'd have to that have to know it was me and then say oh there you are again
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:36.760]   Yeah, okay. We won't show you that see she's honest, which by the way
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:40.760]   I just want to point out is how those cookie tracker things work too
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.720]   If you say I don't want to eat cookies, what do they do? They said a cookie to tell
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:51.480]   The site not to set cookies. So that seems like a bad idea, but okay
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.840]   Activation also this is going to be the court action section
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:02.280]   Activision will pay an 18 million dollar settlement. We talked a lot about this activation blizzard
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.360]   Issue and what a boys club it was and what a mess it was
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:12.440]   Especially in the world of warcraft division. Well, I think this counts as a slap on the wrist they
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.160]   made an agreement with the
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.200]   feds
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.600]   And pay this eight actually no, it's not with the feds. I'm sorry that it was with a federal employment agency
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.320]   The filed a civil rights complaint. I guess it is the feds. They're going to pay 18 million dollar settlement
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:36.920]   Uh that money will be used to compensate and make amends to eligible claimants with the remaining funds go to charities that advance women
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.560]   In the video game industry or promote awareness around harassment and gender equality issues
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.280]   You know what I guess
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.880]   the main point of this lawsuit would be to get them to change their ways and I
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.880]   If there's longer that works that way, I guess it doesn't matter what the settlement is
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.440]   There was it was really bad
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:59.400]   There there are other lawsuits pending
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:04.920]   Uh the communications workers of america filed a complaint this month with an lrb
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:12.520]   Excusing activation of violating federal labor law the sec is also exchanging so they're not out of the woods
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.280]   but
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   part one of the
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.280]   of the problem is over
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:23.080]   I like this deep mind
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:28.520]   Artificial intelligence called deep mind you'd like this to stacy because it uses something like gan
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:34.520]   It's not exactly gan. You can explain what it is. It's it's a deep generative network
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:41.800]   An ai that's trained to generate new samples of data that are very similar to the real data. It's trained on
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.720]   Uh, it is now predicting
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.520]   but one of the hardest
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:52.920]   Problems in meteorology is it going to rain in the next hour and a half
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.880]   Well in seattle, it's just the answer is yes
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:02.360]   It's it's no surprise this research is being done in the uk where they have a similar problem
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:08.680]   Working with the uk's national weather service the met office deep mind has developed a tool called dg
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.080]   mr
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:12.520]   They can accurately predict the likelihood of rain in the next 90 minutes
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:18.360]   Dark sky does a pre darn good job of that. I love that dark sky thing. Yeah
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:23.240]   Yeah, but all the google lovers no longer have access to it. I use it on the web
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:28.440]   That's all I just I just go to the website apple pork them and shut down the app even on iOS
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:34.120]   Website I never thought to do that. Yeah, I just do that. Yeah, it's fun. We're like what the web
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.400]   Yeah, what that used to love that
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.800]   Yeah, so they're keeping the website live. Oh, that's good to know
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.000]   Don't you know you won't get the notifications
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.480]   Uh that it's about to rain on the website. Will you maybe you will you can look up in the sky and you go to this
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:58.840]   Thank you. Yeah, I don't even need a generative adversarial network to do that
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:04.120]   I don't need I don't need no artificial intelligence. I got real intelligence
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:11.560]   I got eyes. That's a good point. Put my hand out. Oh, no. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.240]   I
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:19.320]   They've been working on this for several years jeff do you feel guilty input from the med offices expert shaped the project
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:26.680]   Years of labor down the tubes. Oh wait, you could just look at the sky
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.360]   Oh
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.240]   Oh
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.600]   Our friend mike maznik writing uh on tech dirt
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   About something called the shop safe act jerry nadler such a good master analysis
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.520]   Sounds so good, but yeah
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:54.040]   Jerry nadler who's who's uh, he says a close friend of the always anti internet lobbying force that is the legacy
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:26:02.680]   Copyright industry has proposed something called a shop safe act which sounds like a good idea to keep counterfeit goods
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.560]   out of uh online stores
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.520]   But apparently
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.640]   Uh, it has side effects that could put these online stores like he be out of business forever
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.120]   Um
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:25.400]   Yeah, yeah, all it does is it supports the owners of trademarks and it's the it's the it's the thing equivalent
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.240]   of
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:27.960]   um
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.000]   Having to put up uh detectors for for copyright
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:38.120]   EFF says one measure platforms would have to take under the shop safe act is verifying the identity
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.160]   Address and contact information of any third party seller who uses their services
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:49.560]   So you might have to provide a driver's license to craigslist to advertise your garage sale or sell a used bike
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.800]   I don't think that seems too much
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   Uh, but but it would also apply to facebook and of course even email services
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.080]   If if you sell something using your email
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.080]   Uh, and this is another one and this is happening in australia now where the liability
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.280]   Uh
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.080]   Ends up with the seller but what the internet platform
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.640]   See what happens? Yeah, so in australia
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.600]   Uh, the platforms are now responsible for
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.680]   Comments
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.880]   You know in forums or on websites attached well no no no it's not the platform the publisher
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:37.960]   Is responsible for the comments left on someone else's platform under your article
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.080]   So if you post whether or not you placed it there right whether or not you placed it there
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.520]   So if you have a news article on facebook and somebody comments on it
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.560]   Your life is somebody
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.520]   Once wants to attack. Oh, I don't know me on a on on on twit
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:58.360]   Why did you have that jerk on sunday?
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:06.600]   And they put it up there then are you put it on on youtube then youtube become not only youtube is liable but twitt is liable
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.080]   So cnn's response is
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.800]   We're going to restrict access to facebook pages in australia once again
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:18.040]   australia without news this is the second time that this kind of regulatory
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:25.960]   Reflex has led to taking away news from australia and consumers you if you're australia and you will not be able to access cnn's facebook pages
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.040]   The company said it wants to avoid liability for user comments
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:32.920]   Following this australia in a court ruling
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.880]   Um, yeah, who does that benefit in the end?
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.120]   um
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:51.080]   Facebook says well, no, it's okay. We continue to provide australia's a destination for quality journalism through facebook news
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.760]   And it benefits facebook right?
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.320]   um
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.040]   You go to line 56 for a moment. All right 56
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.840]   Uh, uh, uh, you know australia writes jeff jarvis who's the monopoly?
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.840]   i know it was me
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:14.760]   I'm starting to get a feel for it. This is from media week nelson releases data from latest
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.960]   Nielsen digital landscape report. Tell me what this says
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.160]   Go to that that chart there the top 10 digital parent
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.800]   Which is unique audience people
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.480]   Uh, news corp is basically as big as facebook and google
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.360]   According to nelson in australia
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:36.520]   Unique audience monopoly this is in the in the million so 18 million to google
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:44.440]   17.6 to facebook 17.2 to news corp 16.7 a microsoft who you don't really think of as a as a news source
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:49.400]   This is not news. This is this is everything. Yeah, just unique audience
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:53.240]   australia, i never heard of digital parents before
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.000]   No, that's a term i'm not familiar with but
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.440]   Digital land. This is a digital pailson what nelson calls whatever this is
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:07.080]   What's weird is is companies like wollworths
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:12.360]   And ebay and amazon and australia broadcasting company all in the same kind of
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:17.880]   Well wollworth is a huge brand there. Okay, so she drives. It's just a traffic in other words
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.560]   It's like that's in a walmart. Yeah, it's just trav- all i'm trying to say is g
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.840]   So google and facebook are are monopolies all right all right
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:29.640]   so let's hope
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.640]   uh
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:37.080]   Oh i did you know that i've gotten the alligator in my my job here is done
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.560]   Thank you
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.200]   The kill raven just like we can go home now
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:47.400]   We are at home video. Yeah, there was a poll you talked about on twitter mr. Jarvis
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:53.320]   I can't find it because you tweet it's in here i do apparently it's in here under other off that
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:31:02.440]   Yes, it is line 151 i'm just doing that line 151 news consumption across
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:05.000]   social media in 2021
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.280]   Thanks to you. I hate this question
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:14.360]   That's where do you get your news and if anybody says i got it in facebook then oh my god people got the news from facebook
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.520]   But it doesn't go to the next layer here to say number one
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:23.240]   Well, then what did you click on that and go to a news site which will make us happy
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:27.720]   Uh, how many places do you go for news? What do you define as news?
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:34.120]   Mm-hmm. So it never never goes to that next layer to make this actually use because usually when you get news on facebook
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:37.960]   It's not facebook giving you the news. It's a link to an outside news source
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:43.480]   In facebook, which is why news sources get so much traffic from facebook. It's like saying
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:48.520]   I go to google to get my news. Yeah, because you you google the new york times and then go there
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:53.560]   Right. All right. That's so that's why i did not bring this
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:58.920]   Pew research up on twit either because it's like yeah, I agree it's dopey
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:02.040]   Dopey, dopey, dopey
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.120]   constant dopey
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:04.600]   constant
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:09.720]   All right, let's uh, let's uh, let's see do the drums. What do you say and we'll do the google change
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.400]   Law
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400]   And it's been most of those concert
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.000]   I do
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.080]   I don't believe him. It's gonna be a great concert. Yes
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:23.720]   Let's go see alanis as soon as this is over google maps as this change log. It's not great, but it's okay
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.280]   All right, it'll be
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:32.440]   Find the change laws great. It's great because it's over soon google maps is getting better and mapping wildfires
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.520]   How about that?
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:39.560]   On wednesday google said it's adding a new wildfire layer to google maps
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:43.080]   That's good. This is not going to help you in new jersey
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:47.800]   Or on a big bridge island, but here in northern california will be glivin though
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.560]   The new layer will show hold on now hold on
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:56.840]   That will help in carolina because there's a certain pruit that wants to know if
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:02.760]   Her son is doing okay. It's burning. She's able to pull this up. I told you you'd burn in hell
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.920]   California the new layer
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.240]   Well, you're in the same room
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:16.200]   The new layer will show most major fires that caused significant evacuations
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.200]   Well, there was just a major fire that caused 900 people to be evacuated
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:26.680]   Cross right across the street. That's why I say this is this is significant because when that happened last week
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:31.800]   Yeah, I made sure I sent out a text as quick as I could because I knew
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:37.880]   The news would just talk about california is on fire and you can blah blah blah blah
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.240]   Right, okay. We are okay. So let us know. It's happening in pedaluma. Yeah, everything's good to go. Yeah, you know
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:50.680]   It's like that when you see the news. It seems like, you know, after I learned this during the san francisco quake in the in the 90s
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:55.960]   It looked like the whole city had fallen into a hole, but it didn't it hadn't all right. It was just you know
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:03.960]   Uh, so good and google's going to expand this to uh, australia, which of course had terrible terrible. Yeah fires are coming years ago
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:07.000]   so um
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.480]   Interesting this this goes along with adding air quality index readings to the nest hub
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:16.840]   Which I really after you pointed that out stacey. I just have been loving that. That's something I really appreciate
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.240]   Quite useful. Oh, yeah
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.240]   new google illustrations tool
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:26.440]   Let's you build a custom profile picture for gmail. You can actually draw your own
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:31.800]   Huh, okay. Okay
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:39.800]   What about a picture of yourself? Yeah, there's a thought you know what what I bet kids love that
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:46.440]   Yeah, they have time on their hands. They have, you know, yeah, that's true. Yeah, wait
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.080]   All of that is lost as you age
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.960]   live translated captions
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:54.360]   In google meets. This is a beta
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.280]   Right now, but eventually uh, this will go to all google
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.640]   English conversation to other languages english to spanish french portuguese and german
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.040]   Unfortunately, you have to have a paid version of meetings
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:14.200]   Or the teaching and learning upgrade to use this, but still I think that's really uh, that's very cool
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:17.800]   Yeah, so far this change log is a lot better in the last week
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:26.120]   Did you put that together and come on now? No, I did not no I did not I will not take the youth under of mr
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.000]   Jason howl jason does a good job on this actually
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.760]   Uh, there was a search on conference today
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]   google had its search on
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.720]   Uh event in among the things they talked about was a redesign of the search results page more images
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.880]   More suggested searches more things to know
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.920]   You'll uh, you'll start to notice this
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.680]   Let's see is it gonna happen right away?
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.280]   the redesign
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.520]   I'm not sure
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.320]   Doesn't say here, but uh look look for that
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:07.320]   And when watching a video found via google search will be offered topics and search phrases to learn more
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:13.880]   As they call this google mum multi task unified model
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:20.120]   A technology to better understand and map the world's data as well as better share it with you through search
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:23.160]   Oh, it launches today
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:28.520]   So next time you go search or something on google you'll notice some new things
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:34.920]   Uh, that's the uh search on conference coming up the android dev summit next month
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.520]   And a chrome event in november
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:46.760]   The 2021 android dev summit it's been it skipped last year. We'll take place october 27th and 28th
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:52.920]   So maybe we should consider covering this i'm sure uh probably jason you'll want to do this with all about android
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:58.280]   A 50 minute technical keynote called the android show followed by two days of over 30
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:04.440]   Tech talks. We should probably cover that android show. There's no one they're gonna announce the six formally
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.680]   Uh the the rumor is what the 19th?
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:12.440]   I thought it was the 14th. Is it the 14? I can't remember
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.680]   I can't remember
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.320]   Is there any new guy i gotta ask this i i know this is outside the change lipers a change i want
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:25.000]   Uh rumors i know you don't normally put in rumors because they're meaningless but do you think there's a chance of a new pixel book?
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.040]   Do you think that no no no no
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:33.160]   Paris the thought yes, it's not gonna happen if you he's living in hope isn't he
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.440]   What is that you just i need the mean girls mean
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.480]   Stop trying to make the pixel book happen jeff it's not gonna happen
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:47.880]   Oh, you're so mean she's a mean girl. Oh
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.600]   Meanwhile chrome dev summit 2021 takes place wednesday, november 3rd
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:55.240]   You know
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:59.240]   It's intre. Yeah, they're they're putting these off till after the pixel six right that makes sense

[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.680]   Uh, I was mentioning is sirei
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.840]   She was of course part of google's voices

[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.680]   I love isa on my google
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:32.920]   assistant, uh, she was uh introduced october 2019. I guess they got a two-year deal because

[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.560]   Duff mckagen. Oh
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:53.160]   Quincy Quincy Jones used to be Quincy Jones
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:56.680]   So that's interesting
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.160]   Huh, they must like celebrity voices. It's like that in Las Vegas
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:06.440]   Hi, this is sick flight once this is why watch your bags. How?
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:09.320]   Things like that

[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:23.000]   Uh, I'm still still in the midst of the changelog. Um, sorry for derailleurs, but I had take up for this. All right
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.400]   That's good. I want to give Karen or do it was Jeff's fault
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:30.360]   As our most things
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360]   Well, there's only one more
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.600]   chrome 94
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.000]   rolling out as the first new release in the
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:43.400]   New four week update cycle every four weeks. They'll be a new chrome. Although remember we used to get excited about chrome eight
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400]   The new chrome is here 94
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.400]   94
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.320]   Uh, how much is many podcasts we made?
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.560]   I gotta point out and Steve Gibson talked about this yesterday on securing now
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:59.080]   Google has now had not one not two but 12 zero days this year in chrome
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.760]   So those updates may be felled at faster cage
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:06.760]   How many have microsoft had?
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:13.160]   Let's be real. Yeah, uh, and that is the google changelog
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:20.680]   Well, they suspected it now
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.080]   Computers have proved it
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.040]   Artificial intelligence has deemed that this painting of samsung and dalaya
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.000]   Dalayla in the london national gallery
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:39.800]   Putedly painted by peter paul rubens is not was not by peter paul and mary instead peter paul and mary
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:43.320]   No, I think uh, it's not a rubens not a rubens
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:46.280]   The results are quite astonishing
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:50.520]   Said the scientist who cared that cared out the study the algorithm has returned a 91
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:57.080]   Probability for the artwork not being authentic. They compared the painting to 148
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.120]   uncontested proven rubens paintings
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.960]   And uh, and it just basically said no, that's not even that's not even
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:09.960]   I was so shocked said the dr. korean at pappa vidji
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:13.480]   We repeated the experiments to be really sure that we were not making a mistake
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:21.480]   The result was always the same every patch every single square came out as fake fake fake fake with more than a 90 probability
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:24.360]   You know, this is
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:30.440]   Good, I guess but the the downside of it is ai doesn't really tell you why at least this one didn't
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:33.160]   know exact says exact says yes or no
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:37.960]   But give me a why if it's so it's interesting because it's always been ants
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:44.200]   And that welcome welcome to the future of the world. Yeah, we won't know why that's that's what's gonna happen exactly
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.600]   It's in david weinberger wrote a wonderful book about this
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.360]   um
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360]   We lose explanation
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.720]   Ai will predict something and it will do a good job of predicting it
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.200]   But yeah, it has no explanation
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:01.080]   Apparently can't do again painted by paul rubens who you might remember as p. We herman
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:06.280]   So definitely a fake
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:13.720]   Um, well fake or just somebody else they didn't know who is a bad copy it's attributed it's uh, bad copy
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.880]   How much did it sell for 2.5 million pounds or oh let me well, let me read that part
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.880]   um
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.120]   Critics have long argued it's only a copy of a rubens original that has known to been painted
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:33.080]   between 1608 and 1609 for his ant warp patron, but then disappeared after his death in 1640
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:38.920]   They argued that the national gallery picture is different one that only surfaced in 1929
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:45.960]   Declared of rubens by an art expert who after his death in 1960 was found to have misattributed paintings
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:49.560]   By giving out certificates of authenticity for commercial gain
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.880]   Uh-oh
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:57.880]   Critics dismissed the colors of as uncharacteristic of rubens palette the composition is awkward
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:02.040]   It differs from two contemporary copies of the original
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:08.120]   Okay, so there is there is there was an original but has been lost forever
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:14.920]   Um, and this was a uh, it sounds like a late copy like a copy from the path the last century
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:20.040]   Oops, oopsies
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:26.280]   It was at the time when it was bought in 1980 a record price for a painting 2 and a half million pounds
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:31.240]   Of course that it that price it equipped it eclipsed dramatically
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:39.560]   It had just been an nft everything would be okay. I agree. That's without a problem. We have with nft's
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.360]   So true. We know who who made them
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.840]   Um
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.040]   IBM is trying once again to sail a boat across the
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:56.440]   Atlantic with no humans aboard an autonomous boat. You can't do remote control that far across the Atlantic
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:59.240]   So the boat has to
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:04.520]   Do it all by itself. It's first attempt to recreate the mayflower's voyage
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.720]   Uh failed last year
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:11.160]   And so they've been uh, they've been working on it
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:16.040]   Apparently rough seas, uh, I heard it a little bit more than they expected it to
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:19.320]   So now this is uh, this 49 foot
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:22.440]   triple-hulled vessel
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:28.200]   Which uses a combination of wind turbines diesel and solar power to travel across water with no human intervention
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:34.040]   Of course one of the reasons you want to do this is if you could put research vessels out there that could sail around and gather information
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.760]   Um at a lower cost
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:43.720]   Uh, the researchers say the the uh setback taught them one thing they should have tested it more
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:48.280]   So next spring it will try once again just something to be pay attention to
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.680]   Uh later. Oh, this is cool
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.960]   They're going to turn on cameras and data feeds
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:00.440]   So that you can go online and see what it's doing as it cruises the uk coast through the
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:04.840]   Through the winter. I don't know if we'll be able to do that all the way across the Atlantic, but that's kind of cool
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:08.360]   Here is something I am celebrating
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.840]   you know, uh
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:13.800]   November is it November 7th, john? I think that's what we said the
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.240]   Clocks no, no, it's gonna be is that right the clocks. Yeah, november 7th
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:22.040]   Sunday morning 2 a.m
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.040]   The clocks will fall back. We will lose an hour of sleep
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.960]   at great cost to our mental health and our
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:37.560]   Well-being wait if they go back don't we gain an hour. This is always confusing. I just could still come fall back spring forward
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.720]   So we're gonna be
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   an hour you're right
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:44.760]   Still screws everybody up
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.600]   Samoa
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:54.360]   Has has taken the lead in all of this where the nation's day begins they're abandoning daylight savings time the world's day begins
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.800]   All right, nope no asking saving
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:05.720]   That's correct. I learned that I learned that from veep it's aving aving time daylight aving time. Hey, well
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:11.240]   Not said the clocks
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:16.360]   Forward see I guess they're in flip-flop of us so that we are going to standard time
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:19.480]   But they'll be going to they would be going daylight saving time
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:22.280]   but
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:27.400]   But they're gonna remain on standard time we must be punchy if we're laughing at that that's something wrong
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:34.840]   No, no if you have you seen jonas can't I mean yeah, okay. Have you seen mr. Gox the hamster
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:39.480]   Oh, oh the crypto mouth gox no crypto
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.920]   After malk ox it's a crypto trading hamster who has in fact
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.920]   beaten
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.920]   It's beaten the nasdaq
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:51.640]   It's very good
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:57.160]   The minds behind the furry financier according to the bbc are two men in their thirties from germany
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:04.760]   He felt that everything keeps getting more expensive these days and building savings is super hard to achieve with higher ends to pay
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:12.840]   It seems like most people from our generation see no other chance than slowing away a lot of their savings on the crypto market without having a clue
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:14.520]   so
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520]   We'd had a hamster
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:19.560]   What's great is
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.960]   Uh, if you look at the hamsters cage
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.600]   There there's a picture of mr. Gox
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.520]   Uh, he can enter and leave the office whenever he wants
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:32.920]   the gox box which is the office features
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:41.720]   a uh, a stairs a decision tunnel if he goes in there it's cell a decision tunnel if he goes in there it's by
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:48.280]   An intention wheel which he can spin around. There's of course cameras watching so that they can monitor what he does
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.800]   And then based on the activities mr. Gox
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.640]   Undertakes in his office which he can again he can leave at any time
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.920]   Uh, the office is fully automated
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:06.840]   Software scripting microcontrollers single board computers computer aided design 3d printing laser cutting and more
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:09.720]   And he was even tweeting
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:11.160]   He was
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:12.680]   He was even tweeting
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:18.600]   So the hamster well you could follow his mr. Gox has concluded his office hours tonight with 100 placed
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:25.640]   63.27 euros on career performance. Oh, that's his overall performance 19 percent
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:28.360]   Less than a year
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:33.400]   Mr. Gox it's like the monkeys writing Shakespeare or writing hamlet exactly
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.400]   Exactly apparently mr. Gox has nft's for sale as well
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.400]   Um case of course course he doesn't
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:43.160]   Yeah
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.920]   Well, there's the lifespan of a hamster
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.960]   You want to see mr. Gox about as long as crypto in the box here's mr. Gox
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.520]   In the boks mr. Gox in the box
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.520]   He's the gox box build
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:01.960]   Let's start off the gox box build ladies and gentlemen have a German accent. Yeah. No, it's a robot
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.040]   That's not even a real human speaking
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:07.080]   um anyway, yeah
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:13.320]   There's a lot there's a lot to the gox box that is impressive, but he uh he's doing quite 19 percent
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:16.040]   That's big that's very good
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:21.160]   Yeah, they don't know if we can top that
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.200]   Even Warren buffet can't top that
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:34.520]   China has cracked down we talked about this on sunday on twit on all cryptocurrency related activities it is now illegal
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.440]   to buy sell
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.440]   trade cryptocurrency
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.520]   There was a bit of a river down when that happened too. Yes
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:45.800]   Yes
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:47.960]   China doesn't like the internet now suddenly
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:51.720]   This is my favorite story and then we're going to uh go to our picks of the week
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.440]   a teenager on tiktok
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:58.520]   I like stories that begin with a teenager and tiktok
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:00.680]   uh
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.680]   has confounded
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:06.200]   social scientists and researchers
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:07.880]   uh
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:11.560]   These social scientists used a site called prolific
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.760]   to do surveys
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:16.840]   uh
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:22.840]   For instance behavioral lab at stanford mainly uses the prolific platform for online studies
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.560]   Uh
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:28.280]   Where do you get your news? This is from the voyage
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.440]   No, I'm saying always is like that surveys well these socials, you know
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:35.720]   So
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.320]   Scientists doing this sort of research in the us as the verge generally want a pool of subjects who speak english are not too
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:45.080]   Practiced at taking psychological surveys and make up a reasonable
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:49.720]   Reasonably representative democratic game a graphic sample of the american
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.800]   population
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.800]   all of a sudden
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.720]   All of a sudden
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:59.160]   And this is a tweet from one of the researchers at stanford
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:03.400]   Analyzing her uh 300 person prolific study
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:09.880]   Very generic title and description survey questions most most about social comparisons and money all of a sudden
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.760]   91 percent of the respondents were female
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.040]   Seven percent were male
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:18.040]   How does this happen?
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:21.240]   Then a member of the stanford behavior lab posted
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:26.360]   We've noticed a huge leap in the number of participants in the platform in the us pool from 40 to 80 000
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.480]   Which is great. However now a lot of our studies have a gender skew
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:33.480]   Maybe 85 women plus the age averaging 21
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:39.560]   Wayne state psychologist hannah shekter said wait a minute. This might be far-fetched
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.680]   But have you seen this?
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:45.640]   TikTok video
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:48.840]   Welcome to side hustles. I recommend trying part one
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:55.160]   This series is going to be all about things that you can do relatively easily to make a little extra money or a lot depending on how much you do it
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:54:00.360]   I'm going to try my best to do things that you probably haven't already heard of like the basic door dash depop all of that
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:05.560]   But I might have thrown a base a couple basic ones if I think that they're really genuinely a good way to make money
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.840]   This first one though. I have been doing for a while and it makes me about
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.280]   $15 a day, which is pretty good and it definitely adds up
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:16.360]   The site is called pro-lific and it's spelled like that and basically
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:21.240]   It's a bunch of surveys for different amounts of money and different amounts of time that earns you money
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:27.800]   So today I made 14 60 and that's in pounds, but it converts to 20 us dollars
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.520]   So this video by
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:33.240]   Sarah and Dom
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.880]   Sarah's side hustles apparently has been seen on tiktok
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:40.120]   by millions
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:44.040]   Young women are flocking to the site
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.320]   According to a Bradley
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:52.120]   4,600 studies were disrupted by this tiktok about a third of them on the platform
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.360]   And they're and they got to foot the bill, huh? Well
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:01.000]   20 dollars they do point out young women who enjoy tiktok are people too
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.640]   um
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.920]   Frank says
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:08.520]   Sarah her real name is Sarah Frank. She says her side hustle video is the most popular tiktok
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:13.560]   She's ever posted it didn't occur to me it would blow up. It just posted it for my friends and followers
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:16.120]   Um
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:21.480]   She's paused her own side hustles as she settles in to her freshman year at Brown University
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.440]   I think she has a very promising career
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:29.240]   Wow ahead of her brown the power of tiktok yeah brown's hard to get into she's good
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:31.960]   She's good
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:36.280]   She was a florida high school a graduate posted it on july 23rd
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.600]   And
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:41.960]   It completely screwed up prolific.com whoops
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.720]   The social media at it again
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.840]   Speaking of tiktok
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:53.160]   Such a nadella was talking to kara swisher at the code conference
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:56:00.280]   She asked him about i'm glad she did. I don't think you know, I think our good journalists would probably not have brought this up
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.800]   She asked him about the weird
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.400]   Microsoft attempt to buy tiktok
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:11.080]   Uh, yeah, yeah
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.440]   He said nadella said it was the strangest thing i've ever sort of worked on
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.560]   He said I was kind of intrigued by it, but I guess the rest is history tiktok came to him
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:25.640]   Not the other way around first of all you've got to remember tiktok came to us
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:29.080]   We didn't go to tiktok tiktok was caught in between a lot of issues
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.640]   They were having across two capitals and they wanted a partner obviously washing in dc
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:40.120]   I'm not sure what the other one is maybe beijing tiktok wanted a security focused cloud computing provider he added
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:44.840]   But I was pretty intrigued and let's say it's a great property obviously
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:53.400]   Nadella continued microsoft was effectively turned off of any potential deal by the particular perspective of the trump administration
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:59.080]   President trump I think he had sort of a particular point of view. I don't need to try to get done there
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.640]   Nadella said then just dropped off
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:07.240]   It was interesting there was a period of time. I felt that the us government had some particular set of requirements and then
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:10.040]   They just disappeared
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:15.320]   So now we know
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:19.720]   And I think we suspected this tiktok by the way has now a billion users
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.080]   1 billion active users this is amazing right yeah
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:33.320]   This is according to the company itself monthly active users which in its its growth has happened is in five years
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:39.400]   Compared to similar growth that took eight years with facebook eight years with youtube and whatsapp
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.160]   It's a very fast growing
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:47.880]   And it is now
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:50.200]   As we mentioned a couple of weeks ago
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:56.280]   Engaged the most engaging social media beating youtube and time spent viewing
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:01.560]   Okay
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:06.680]   Anything else did I leave anything out jeff or stacey or ant that you you wanted to talk about
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:10.200]   Not yet the one that I mentioned
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:16.520]   That was on my brain could go to the old trucker with the cute kitten. Oh lord. You really have a
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.520]   He
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:21.080]   At least it's not a musical cute video problem
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:23.800]   Old trucker one
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:28.040]   Oh trucker and bobbi or should I say bobbi and old trucker now
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:31.000]   Uh, whole series of the real
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.800]   Little the little trucker and a little kitty
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:38.200]   You know, this is the view. I like this. I'm actually loving tiktok and look at this
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:42.280]   3.1 million views because how can resist this
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:45.320]   internet's no sespore
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:50.120]   Bobbi and old you follow the FedEx dog guy no
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:55.240]   He just warms my heart. What's he called? He basically he's a FedEx delivery guy. I don't know
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:57.240]   It's like the FedEx dog guy. I don't
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:59:03.080]   Maybe that's his I have FedEx dog girl, but I don't know if I want to pull that one up
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:10.920]   Please don't this guy is a FedEx driver and all he does is dogs come up to his truck when he shows up
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.520]   And he just pets the dog and gives him a treat and you like meet lots of dogs and he's clearly enjoying he's like hello, buddy
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:23.560]   And the dogs are like hello. Would you like to see my son's tan has been attacked 10 million viewed
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:27.160]   He doesn't film those ant 10 million views
[01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:32.760]   10 million views for salt
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:35.480]   He is now
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.160]   Get ready for this
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:42.200]   Just 11,000 away from half a million followers by the way people let's put this over the edge
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:46.200]   Let's show the power salt underscore hank. Yeah. No, I don't think that's gonna
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:53.560]   Is he advertising on the show yet? I mean come on man. Yeah, look at this 16.7 million views
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.800]   Look at this
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:57.800]   Wow, it's amazing
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:05.000]   Wow, there's something weird about tiktok. So him what every episode because i'm just gonna be hungry. This is a point
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.520]   That's the point. This is why
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:15.720]   I'll show you the one that only got a quarter of a million views that'll that'll turn you off french fries
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:18.680]   And a chicken hero
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:21.960]   Well, that'll still climb though
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:28.280]   Yeah, he actually this is you know, I didn't I know why I didn't this one is an ad for dannos
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:32.280]   Spice seasonings or something they're paying him to put their seasoning in them
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:36.040]   And I think tiktok saw that because it went from 4.6 million
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:41.000]   16.7 13.7. These are the adjacent videos 9.9 million
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.560]   Quarter of a million right in the middle because I think because it hadn't added I think tiktok did he
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.320]   um
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.320]   Hashtag yeah hashtag
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:53.400]   I think at the bottom it says hashtag dannos partnership
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:58.520]   I think they don't want him to do ads. They don't say anything against it
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.560]   But that's the only action. Okay. There was just a story
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:06.360]   In the wall street channel about tiktok and ads I think they do ads right
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:10.920]   But you don't the problem of the ads is they're not attached to your video like youtube ads are they're either
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:15.160]   Itterssticial so they don't really share the revenue with you. They have a creator's fund
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:18.440]   You can make some money from that, but it's not tied to the ad revenue
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:25.000]   So but they don't say you can't have ads in your tiktoks lots of people do but I notice I mean that's an interesting trend
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.800]   Come on all of a sudden
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:29.480]   No views
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:34.440]   I mean could be I mean it was pretty subtle. I don't think it was because there was an ad it was it was just you know
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:36.440]   He showed the stuff
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:41.320]   I don't know makes you wonder maybe because you shouldn't put french fries in heroes
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.640]   I think might be that I think it might actually just been nobody wanted
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.400]   Against the least incident
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:53.080]   tiktok sensitive we have found the facebook dog guy
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:58.040]   That acts dog guy one 74 on facebook
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:01.240]   Oh, she's here he is
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:03.640]   Let's look at it picked up a cute hitchhiker
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:05.240]   Look at these dogs. They're so happy
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.200]   He makes a new furry friend every day
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:12.040]   What what is he carrying squirrels around what's going on here?
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.760]   He's making treats. Oh, he's got bacon
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:18.280]   That's cute. That's better than uh, you know
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.800]   Brain him with dog repellent
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:24.520]   He's got lots of treats
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:27.000]   Oh, this is this is actually sweet
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:29.720]   Thanks to the daily mail for that one
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:36.680]   All right, all right now we're gonna take a break and when we come back your picks of the week
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.720]   And we're back
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:48.200]   And we're back stacey higgetbotham. What's your pick this week?
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:51.000]   Well, this is something I just
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.680]   Talk to someone about this is where I was when I was sliding into
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:01.000]   To hit the show on time. I was hanging out with some dev friends and they showed off the esp 32 the sp 32
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:08.520]   Um, which is a very popular dev board out there for microcontrollers and this one is brand new
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.680]   $10 and
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:14.040]   It's the sp 32 with a risk five processor
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.040]   And why?
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:22.760]   So risk five is really important because this is the open source future, right? Yeah, uh, microprocessor
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:28.920]   And I think it's very interesting. I'd love to see this take off great. So oh, it's totally taking off
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.080]   Yeah, yeah, we're excited about this
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:35.800]   So I I just wanted to share this because I mean you can buy a dev kit for 10 bucks
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:43.000]   You get a really powerful microcontroller. This is actually a larger processor than the traditional sp 32
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.800]   Um, but with the risk five you can do some machine learning stuff on it. That's pretty cool. So I just threw this out there because it's
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:58.520]   It has a minute stock. It's fairly new. Um, and I just saw it in person and it is like so tiny and so cool and
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:03.080]   I don't know. Anyway, that's it. That's my thing. That's a good thing
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:09.160]   We'll talk more about risk five. We we were talking a little bit about it on floss weekly last week when we uh interviewed
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:16.360]   The ceo and founder of system 76 because we were talking about this whole idea of oh, you know core boot open source boot
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:23.000]   Firmware, but then wouldn't it be great if the processors are open source and he oh he believes at risk five is is
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.840]   Gonna become the dominant risk five has been brought up. You want to educate people about this several times. Yeah
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:33.960]   Sure, Stacy. I was like I I love like I can suggest so many great people
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:38.680]   So you just asked me that I've been following this for years. I've been waiting for it. I just freaking love it
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:41.880]   yeah instead of it being apple or intel or
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.880]   It's no instead of it being intel or arm or
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:48.440]   nips or any
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.440]   proprietary. Yeah
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:52.600]   Well
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:53.960]   Yes
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:57.480]   So basically for anybody who wants to build and design a processor
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:00.440]   You can build a custom processor now
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:05.320]   Using open source tools. You'll still need like the compilers and all the other tooling
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.200]   But that's what companies like scitime are doing and
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:11.240]   The big companies in vidia western digital
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:17.000]   They're all building their own internal processor course like to manage their other processors
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:22.760]   Um using risk five but we're gonna start seeing it in like consumer devices and if you're a startup
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:28.600]   It means you don't have to pay the licensing fees. Yeah, it's a creative commons license, which is really huge
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:33.400]   Yeah, very exciting. So well, yeah, well, I don't you know
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:39.320]   We'll just keep an eye on it and when there's stories we'll definitely cover it because I think I didn't realize you were a risk five day vo t
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.520]   Oh, yeah, or as a devotee
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:49.400]   Anyway, you're one of those created in 2012 at berkeley. I interviewed the guy who helped create it. Yeah
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:53.880]   Sorry, I'm a former chip reporter. Y'all do that. I know I love it. That's awesome. Keep that up
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.160]   That's awesome. Jeff Jarvis. Do you have a numero for us?
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:01.960]   I mean already gotten in dogs cats and alligators. I'll turn to something serious
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:08.600]   Um and useful I think that don't say me this is new. I don't know. No, don't you're safe. You're safe
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:13.720]   Fear not my friend fear not the tech legislation tracker
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:17.320]   Uh, let me see that. Okay is pretty useful
[02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:19.160]   um
[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:23.560]   All of the the the bills in process how you become a bill
[02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.400]   um
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:26.680]   Um
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:28.200]   About technology
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:34.280]   Well, that's good. So there's a lot of stuff that we talk about is in here. So this is a great place to go
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:37.320]   to read about all of these
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:41.160]   You know bills that we've been talking into about uh on the show
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:44.840]   Nice lots of them. Yeah, wow, there's a lot
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:49.240]   This is I mean, I think this this right here will give mike maznik a huge headache
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:53.080]   Yeah, a lot of them. I'm going what no what no
[02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:57.880]   All right, that is uh legislation tracker dot
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:03.640]   c-s-e-t dot tech see says the center for security and emerging
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:06.360]   technology
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:08.280]   nice
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:09.800]   mr. Aunt pruit
[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:11.800]   What's your thing?
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:19.560]   Uh, I've been dinking around more and more with the with the venti resolve nice thinking just thinking around
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:22.200]   Just decorating around
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:28.920]   I like it. It's a new verb to me. I like that thinking is good. I'm stealing that. Yeah, I'm stealing that. Yeah
[02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:34.440]   Compliments have mother pruit. Yes, that's what we come from taking around. Um, but yeah
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:37.560]   I've been playing around with resolve for a little while now
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:39.400]   and
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:42.040]   Just just because it felt like it and mr
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:45.720]   Alice lindsey put me on to ripple training and they had these

[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:25.480]   next I just want to give a shout out to listener and friend charlie hoover
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:30.200]   Because he's been on my brain. He's been working on this fitness and stuff and he's doing a great job
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:36.760]   And this product comes of mine. It's so simple yet. It's so tough and it's and I know you folks would really appreciate it
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:39.160]   And it's just an ab roller
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:45.720]   I hate it when my trainer makes me do this. I hate a little $10 device will break you down
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:48.760]   I remember the first time you can do that on a foam roller
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:51.880]   Yeah, but this is your because it's got handles
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:55.720]   This has see like that you're doing like push-ups with it kind of sort of
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:01.880]   I bought one of those probably about 10 years ago and I remember when I first got it the box said
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:08.200]   Do five and i'm looking at it's like five come on man. I'm an approved. I can do more than that
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:10.200]   and I did my
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:16.040]   Five or ten or whatever and I was dying the next day. It really does work out your core
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:22.520]   So I highly recommend if you can you know afford 10 bucks go order yourself an ab wheel and work on your core and
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:26.040]   Get yourself a little bit more fit just from the core
