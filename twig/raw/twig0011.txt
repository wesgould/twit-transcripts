[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.880]   What's the matter with this picture?
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.120]   Where's Leo?
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.880]   Leo was often Dubai, studying himself and having kebabs
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.720]   all-bet and having a good time.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.480]   So you're stuck with me trying to sit in adequately
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.160]   in his shoes.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.800]   But thank goodness.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.280]   We have to the rescue as always, Jeetah Jirpani.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.760]   Hello.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.520]   Hello, Jeetah.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.520]   I'm missing you very much.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280]   Fancy new microphone.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.560]   Yes, I've got a fancy new microphone today.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.760]   And it is a little weird to be here without the president
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.240]   of the internet.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.280]   But we have some awesome guests, so I'm excited.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.840]   It's going to be good.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.480]   Dekeina Foll, why don't you introduce guest number one?
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.440]   Guest number one, I'm assuming.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.640]   We'll go with Liz.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.960]   Liz Lolly, a friend of mine and a brilliant person
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.640]   who I've been dying to have on the show.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.440]   And we have a really good reason to have her on the show.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.320]   She's got this excellent project, which I can't wait
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.280]   to hear or talk about today.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.480]   And then guest number two, we are delighted to have Matt
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.680]   cut back from Google.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.800]   Having had approval.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.720]   And we have the new hairless map.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.920]   What's the deal, Matt?
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.160]   Yes, I lost a bet.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.360]   And so I have a good aerodynamic coefficient of friction now.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   I can swim very well.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.160]   I can cut through the air very efficiently.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.040]   Is it cold, Matt?
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.200]   It can get a little cold.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.280]   Yeah, I need to get a little cap or something like that.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.360]   Well, why don't we start with Liz's project?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.960]   Because it's exciting and a new kind of way
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.080]   to tie the virtual and the real world together.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.680]   So Liz, why don't you give us the URL and the story?
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.880]   OK, so the URL is picturetheimpossible.com.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.680]   And the basic idea behind it is we decided at RIT
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.600]   that we wanted to work with our local newspaper to essentially
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.160]   try to save newspapers, which was a small--
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.560]   That's Rochester as to technology and Rochester.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.320]   That's correct.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.800]   Rochester as to technology.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.520]   I teach in an interactive games and media department there.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.400]   And I run the lab for social computing.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.680]   And the newspaper wanted to do something collaborative with us.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.440]   And I said, how about an alternate reality game?
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.040]   And they said, that's a great idea.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.120]   Let's do it now.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.200]   And then I had this moment of panic
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.880]   because I've, of course, never actually built an alternate reality
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.240]   game.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.160]   I've only played them.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.040]   And suddenly, I was in charge of once.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.600]   So we've been working with them for about a year now.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.560]   And the game launched in September.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.400]   And the whole point of the game is
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.600]   to try to make the newspaper more relevant audiences that
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.120]   haven't cared about it in the past by integrating
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.040]   the community features of what it does, the news aspects,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.800]   and really connecting people up with the tangible aspects
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.840]   of the paper as well.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.240]   So every week, we do online games, which
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.600]   are sort of the simple, less exciting parts of it,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.160]   everything from slider puzzles to jigsaw puzzles.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.240]   But we also do scavenger hunts around the city.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.800]   We do a set of really challenging puzzles in the paper,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.000]   including some that are spread out over multiple editions
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.160]   and multiple weeks.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   So the people have to collect the paper
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.440]   and assemble the puzzle pieces together.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.200]   And then lots of individual challenges
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.520]   where we print our players, winning photographs and screens
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.840]   from their videos and things like that in the paper.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.160]   And the newspaper has totally stepped up on this.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.040]   And in addition to helping a lot with the development,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.800]   they've also devoted the entire back page of the sports section
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.080]   every week for seven weeks to coverage of the game
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.600]   so that the game has become really an integral part
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.680]   of the paper.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.800]   And what we're seeing is a big bump in the number of people
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.440]   buying single copies of the paper.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.160]   And now what we don't know is if when they stop with the game,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.360]   they will keep getting the paper.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.440]   And I hope--
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   But isn't the paper itself part of me for being cyber-gunned,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.120]   a little bit irrelevant, as long as they maintain
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.200]   a relationship with each other and the community
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.000]   through the paper brand?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.920]   Isn't that a real victory?
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.280]   It's a huge victory.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.160]   And we're really excited about what's been accomplished.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.040]   I mean, what we're seeing in terms
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.280]   of the level of commitment and enthusiasm
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.120]   and engagement of the users has been huge.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.320]   The time spent on site is much better
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.520]   than what they get in the normal paper site itself.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.960]   But also, people are really thinking about talking
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.400]   about aware of the paper in a way that they weren't before.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.840]   And in a perfect world, what I would love to see
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.480]   is for game developers to become part of newspaper staff,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.840]   that do this on an ongoing basis,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.080]   that if the only reason people are buying the paper
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.000]   is because of the game, that's great.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.720]   There are people who only buy a paper because of the sports
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.920]   news or because of the local news or because of the comics
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.400]   page.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.480]   There's no reason that the game can't be equally important.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.120]   And we're really trying to play with the tangible aspects
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.000]   of the paper, too.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.400]   Folding things, building things, playing
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   with the physical aspects of the paper itself.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.000]   And so far, it's been really successful.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.280]   I did a big project at City University of New York
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.920]   where I teach in new business models for news
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.200]   that I've mentioned on the show before.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.160]   And we used some industry standard numbers
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.120]   for engagement with newspaper sites.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   And it's sinfully low.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.920]   newspaper sites run about 12 page views per user,
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.600]   per month, compare that with Facebook, which is 12 per user
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.920]   per day.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.640]   And if we think that newspapers are truly
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.320]   involved and part of their community,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.480]   that's the demonstration that they're not.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.640]   So making games, finding new ways to bring people together,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.280]   new ways to be able to community,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.160]   that's what a paper is, I think.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.080]   That's what we're hoping.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.120]   We want this to be deeply engaging.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.080]   We want people to see the paper as relevant and as connecting
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.000]   them to other people.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.560]   And we're seeing some really amazing stuff.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.360]   I mean, at this point, we're only--
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.520]   we're about halfway through the game, little over halfway.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.120]   And so a lot of it is still anecdotal evidence
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.240]   until we can sit down at the end and crunch all the numbers.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.200]   But it's, for example, very con right now for groups of people
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.040]   from the game to get together in local coffee shops
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.120]   with the Sunday paper to solve the puzzles together
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.080]   as the puzzles get harder and harder
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.360]   and they need collaborative help in solving them.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.520]   Today, Alan Leif, who's one of the pioneers of ARG development,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.880]   was in town for the weekend to give a talk.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.200]   And he and I went and did the scavenger hunt downtown
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.160]   and bumped into a whole bunch of people
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.880]   who were walking with their papers,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.920]   with their mobile phones, doing our scavenger hunt
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.720]   and connecting to the city and to each other.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.120]   And so we're seeing really deep engagement from people.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   We had 150 people create photosense of horse statues
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.480]   around the city and submit those the very first weekend
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.120]   of the game when we first launched it,
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.720]   something we thought hardly anybody would do.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.800]   We asked our players to take pictures,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.960]   including at least three firsts from Rochester.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.240]   So Western Union was founded here.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.960]   The first beauty salon was here, Kodak and Xerox
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.120]   and all kinds of things like that.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.840]   And we got 150 extraordinary creative images
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.960]   that then several of which were printed in the paper.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.000]   And we're just seeing that this brings people
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.680]   much more deeply into the experience
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.040]   'cause they care about it
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.480]   because they're engaged in interacting with it.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.840]   - So please, go ahead.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.040]   - Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.960]   - I was gonna ask you a question, you go ahead.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.120]   - I was gonna say for people who haven't played ARGs
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.680]   or alternate reality games before,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.320]   so you teach at RIT and a group of students there
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.760]   are working with the local paper.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.120]   Tell me what the alternate reality is like.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.600]   I mean, what is it like for readers?
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.000]   What's the game like and what's the timeline like?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.960]   - So we made a decision when we started
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.960]   that we didn't want this to be a typical ARG in some ways.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.400]   We talked with a bunch of ARG developers.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.040]   And one of the things they warned us about
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.320]   is that in a lot of ARGs, what happens is that 80%
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.960]   of the content is designed for 20% of the players,
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.120]   the people who are really hardcore,
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.080]   solve every puzzle, dig up every clue,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   devote 30 hours a week to the game.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.880]   And we wanted this to be something
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.600]   that could have a casual user base
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.800]   and have the casual users be considered important as well.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.760]   So we essentially created two things.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.800]   First, there is a narrative behind it.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.640]   ARGs generally have a storyline behind them
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.480]   where you're turning your day-to-day world
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   into the game board for some kind of narrative storytelling
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.640]   going on.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.960]   So what we've said is, let's imagine that there is
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.920]   a secret society here in Rochester,
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.080]   one that's been here for several hundred years
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.600]   and that all of the important figures here,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.280]   the Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.720]   and the founders of Western Union and Kodak and Xerox,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.800]   all of them have been members over the years.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.360]   But lately, the society has been racked
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.640]   by a lot of internal conflict
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.280]   and there are three factions fighting for control
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.400]   of the society.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.040]   They really wanna revitalize the organization
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.160]   with younger people.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.120]   And so they're using this game as a way
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.480]   to identify new members for the society.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.120]   And so there's an underlying narrative
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.840]   that if you dig, you can find it.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.040]   There are Twitter feeds, there are blog posts,
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.160]   there are puzzles and things like that.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.440]   But for probably 80% of the users,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.760]   what they're seeing is something really straightforward.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.200]   If you go to picture the impossible and sign up,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.440]   every week for seven weeks, we've got a different theme.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.280]   And the themes are all drawn from the history of Rochester,
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.360]   the important community aspects.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.840]   So week one, we did arts and crafts
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.040]   to coincide with the local arts festival.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.600]   Week two, we did local food and drink.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.400]   This week is imaging and optics
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.120]   'cause we've got Bouch and loan here,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.760]   we've got pictometry here, Kodak, Xerox.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.320]   And so within each week for the theme,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.440]   we have five different web-based flash activities
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.120]   that people can do, map games, video quizzes
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   that we do in partnership with the local TV station.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.880]   And so you can play those without ever leaving your computer.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.240]   We also have local games.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.880]   We do one individual challenge and one scavenger hunt
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.160]   every week so that people can go out and explore the city
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.080]   and find the things we're pointing them to.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.040]   And then there's at least two newspaper puzzles
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.680]   every week, things that one in the Sunday paper
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.520]   and one somewhere else in the paper during the week.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.680]   So for many of our players, that's all they see.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.440]   They're really not that interested in the story
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.120]   and going down the rabbit hole,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.760]   but there is a rabbit hole there
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.360]   for the people that wanna play with it.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.680]   And then part of the story in terms of the people being
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.120]   in factions is when you choose a faction
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.640]   when you first log into the game,
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.480]   each faction is associated with the local charity.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.680]   Each week we add up all the points that our players achieve
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.320]   and the faction that has earned the most points
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   and aggregate their charity gets the largest donation
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.440]   from the money we got from a foundation.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.520]   So there's a reason for people to keep coming back
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.560]   to the site because every week their points count
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.000]   and not only to helping them get invitations
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.800]   to a party at the end, but also towards helping the charities.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   And we're seeing some great stuff like people who have gone
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.000]   to the charities and asked for tours
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.840]   and done videos featuring them
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.280]   because they really want a centering point
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.960]   for their faction to be involved with.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.040]   So a lot of this was about defining what we wanted people
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.240]   to accomplish in the game.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.680]   And we did it, we talked with Jane McGonigal
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.560]   and she said, people need to know,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   what are the verbs you wanna associate this?
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.720]   And we said, well, we want them to give back,
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.320]   we want them to learn and we want them to explore.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.600]   And so far we've been amazingly successful
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.440]   on all three of us.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.960]   - What's exciting to me about this is,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.640]   well, Fred Wilson at AVC.com,
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.000]   the venture capitalist blogger wrote a post today
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   talking about the Golden Triangle,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.200]   things that come in between mobile and live,
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.640]   and now I'm gonna forget the third.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.480]   I'll remember it in a second.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.560]   And I threw in local as well.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.800]   And I think there was something to the idea of stuff
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.440]   that comes in together and brings it together.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.240]   We talked about this on the show last week,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.200]   the idea of the annotated world,
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.400]   of tying together the internet with the real world.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.520]   What's neat about this is that it's local and it's live
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.040]   and it keeps things going,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.880]   which probably is a good segue into the next topic
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   for the week, which is Google's mobile strategy
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.800]   coming together.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.720]   Pardon me while I look off screen here to our wave,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.560]   which we have.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.080]   There's a whole bunch of news here.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.200]   Let me just list it real quickly.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.440]   Android is finally coming to AT&T says the rumor,
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.880]   which seems to be fairly solid,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.640]   that the Dell phone using Android is gonna come to AT&T.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.120]   And that means the Google now gets hegemony
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.800]   among the mobile operators.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.760]   Number two, Google and AT&T continue sniping over VoIP,
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.120]   Google tries to argue this week that it's not really
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.760]   a phone company, it's just a feature,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.560]   so it has the right to block certain calls.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.400]   AT&T importantly, back down on VoIP
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.440]   and now allows VoIP applications.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.640]   Next, Google has added rich advertising,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.160]   rich ads sends to its mobile pages and mobile apps,
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.920]   which I think is really important.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.360]   Then we have, I think, some news on cyanogen and so on.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.600]   So there's a lot going on with mobile application
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.800]   and Eric Schmidt's been talking about local and mobile.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.480]   Matt, fill us in a little bit about
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.620]   where you think local and mobile go together with search.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.360]   - Yeah, I think they go together really well
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.480]   if you think about it because it's kind of nice
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.360]   that we have voice recognition going now
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.080]   and then we know where your mobile phone is
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.720]   and you can always correct that location if you want to.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.400]   So you can do a search and I've done this last night
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.960]   where you're searching for El Rio
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.880]   or someplace in San Francisco
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.480]   and we will show you the closest El Rio
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.040]   because we think we know where you are.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.240]   And then we can also say,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.040]   "Oh, here are some directions if you'd like to go there."
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.760]   And one extra thing that I don't even know
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.000]   whether or not made the list was
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.440]   we just added search options on the mobile search.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.560]   So now you can say, "Okay, I'd like to show me results
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.880]   within the last 24 hours or something like that."
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.040]   So it's the same functionality that you can do
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.360]   on desktop search, but it's now available on your mobile phone.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.400]   And I mean, if you think about all the different Android phones
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.160]   that are coming out, especially in the holiday sort of season,
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.280]   there really is a lot of momentum for people to be able
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.200]   to hack their phone, install applications,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.280]   do all sorts of weird, cool, neat new stuff.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.280]   So I'm looking forward to it.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.640]   Gina, do you even write many Android things?
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.280]   - You know, I haven't been doing much Android development,
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.680]   but it is really exciting.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.440]   What's happening on Android is really exciting right now.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.960]   I mean, basically this holiday season,
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.880]   ACTIA, which is a wireless conference happened here
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.920]   in San Diego this week.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.720]   And there are a couple of announcements.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.440]   Tomorrow, the HTC Hero comes out on Sprint,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.320]   which will be an Android phone.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.160]   Samsung is gonna do the moment phone on November 1st.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.680]   I mean, essentially you're looking at Android phones.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.120]   You're gonna have lots of choice and handset
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.160]   and lots of different flavors of the operating system as well,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.520]   depending on the carrier and choice
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.920]   when it comes to carrier as well,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.040]   which is I think is what is the difference between
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.440]   the iPhone and Android right now,
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.800]   is that you just have a lot more choices
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.320]   and you can customize and, hey, you like the flip out keyboard,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.280]   great, you can get a handset.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.800]   I haven't played around with any of the new Android handsets yet,
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.280]   mostly because I'm too cheap to get a new handset
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.720]   before my contract is up,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.120]   but I am gonna be playing with the new, I think,
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.960]   the Hero, I think tomorrow.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.360]   - I want a new business right now.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.560]   Maybe I should answer our wish list,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.880]   but I wanna create a business where we can gang together
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.280]   and five of us can buy phone handsets
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.040]   and trade them back and forth.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.920]   - Yes, and just try them out.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.840]   I guess if I asked, I could get review units.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.280]   I just hate taking review units.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.640]   And so--
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.560]   - Well, now the Federal Trade Commission will come after you
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.800]   and-- - Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.320]   - Or you'll find, you don't admit to your sin
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.840]   if you dare write about.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.120]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   The other kind of interesting Android thing that happened
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.440]   is a donut dropped last week.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.680]   I just got it on my G1.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.480]   And a few donut is the new update to Android.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.880]   All the Android updates are named after pastries
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.080]   for a reason I'm not sure.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.040]   So the previous one was Cupcake
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.200]   and a donut is 1.6.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.840]   And a few weeks ago on this show,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.320]   I had featured the Cyanogen Custom Android ROM,
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.240]   which I had hacked my phone and installed this custom ROM.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.440]   And then there was a little tussle
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.800]   between Google and the developer Cyanogen.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.040]   Google said, "Hey, there are some closed source apps
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.440]   in this ROM that you're redistributing
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.680]   and you can't do that.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.200]   The operating system is open source, but not the apps."
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.600]   And so the great news this week,
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.760]   and actually this happened last week,
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.560]   but now Cyanogen, who is the developer,
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.480]   has actually released a version.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.080]   He's released a version of the ROM
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.400]   that does not include any of the closed source apps.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.600]   And he's also offering a utility
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.200]   that lets you back up the apps,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.520]   which you have a license for
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.960]   because you purchased the phone
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.000]   and then reinstall them onto his ROM.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.520]   So that'll be in the show notes.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.920]   So great news to Cyanogen.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.320]   Really happy that he was able to work that out with Google.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.600]   Happy to see how that worked out.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.320]   So yeah, it will be interesting.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.640]   I mean, I'm happy to see that Sprint is, you know,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.240]   taking on the Android platform,
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.840]   and which is much more open and has just better apps.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.240]   And will let people, you know,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.320]   walk around with their smartphones
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.920]   and participate in more community, you know, games,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.880]   like they want, like picture of the impossible.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.560]   - What do we think about Dell doing a phone?
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.320]   I have a little bit of a relationship with Dell
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.120]   going back to unhappier than happier times.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:18.960]   (laughing)
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.400]   But it's about time for them to get into this, I think.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.240]   Isn't it?
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.760]   - There's certainly been some reports,
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.200]   but I don't know whether anything's been confirmed quite yet,
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.720]   but you know, you get Android on Verizon,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.080]   it's gonna be an exciting holiday season, I think,
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.600]   because there's a lot of stuff coming out.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   And so whichever carrier you prefer,
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.080]   I think you'll have a lot more options,
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.920]   which is something that's really nice.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.760]   - If one of you were gonna get a phone for me
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.800]   for I don't know Christmas,
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.720]   which Android phone do you think
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.920]   is the hot one to lust after?
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.800]   - I would hold off a little while,
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.880]   because, you know, it seems like the announcements
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.400]   are coming fast and furious for the time being.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.920]   And so if you can sort of wait
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.200]   and see how the holiday season sort of shakes out,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.040]   then you'll probably have a little more ability
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.160]   to sort of, you know, take a look at different things.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.960]   The hero and my touch, there's a lot of good ones right now,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.680]   but you know, it seems like we're in a period
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.800]   where we're getting a lot of announcements really quickly.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.680]   And so if you sort of give it just a little bit of time,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.040]   I suspect, you know, you'll have all sorts
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.840]   of different options.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.480]   And then you'd hate to have one,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.960]   and then, you know, a new one comes out three days later
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.800]   or something like that.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.520]   So there's a lot of good ones.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.120]   The hero, for example, looks very good
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.640]   as far as the ones that I've heard of.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.960]   So, you know.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.320]   - Yeah, I think I'm a big fan of being a late, early adopter
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.440]   when it comes to gadgets.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.720]   I always kind of wait to see what people say
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.560]   when they have it.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.400]   I do with the iPhone too.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.600]   It's like, let's just wait to see, you know,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.960]   what comes out and what people think of it
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.720]   and then make decision, although you can play
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.640]   the waiting game forever,
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.720]   'cause there's always gonna be something new.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.600]   I saw that on TechCrunch just before we came on the air,
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.000]   somebody, there was a picture of a guy who put his palm pre
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.760]   and his glass of beer, which I think was a review of it.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.680]   Liz, did you find the paper is understanding mobile
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.640]   and understanding the idea of trying to deal with people
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.960]   in and out two ways with their mobile devices?
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.400]   - To an extent, you know, the person we've been working with
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.760]   at the paper is now the managing editor,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.120]   but when we started with her,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.280]   she was the head of multimedia and innovation
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.120]   for the paper and she really gets it
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.520]   and she's been hiring a lot of really good people
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.920]   in the development side and actually the Rochester
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.760]   Gannett paper has a fabulous mobile site
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.440]   in terms of getting information out.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.640]   For the going back in, we, you know,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.680]   they don't quite have that in place.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.520]   So we've been using a platform called Scavenger
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.120]   from a company in Boston that we've been really delighted
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.160]   with for the mobile Scavenger hunts,
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.640]   but I think they see the value of it
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.960]   and it's more simply a resource allocation issue
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   is having enough people in, you know,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.080]   this current newspaper economy to be able to build
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.520]   the kinds of tools they've liked to for a mobile interaction.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.240]   - Liz, I know, I'm sorry, Jeff, I keep cutting you off.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.760]   It's the problem I'm having Leo in the driver's seat.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.320]   - Folks can't see each other in video this time
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   because there's no view of Uncle Leo.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.400]   - Right, exactly.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.720]   - I apologize, I'm interrupting, go ahead, Leo.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.480]   - I just gonna say, you know, this show is called
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.800]   This Week in Google, but it's really about computing.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.240]   And even though Matt, you know, works for Google
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.280]   and we talk about Google a lot, it's about the cloud general.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.000]   And Liz, I wanted to ask you, I know that Bing
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.160]   was a big sponsor of Picture the Impossible.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.320]   So I wanted to ask you, were there any tie-ins with Bing
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.520]   or was it, you know, how did that sponsorship work?
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.480]   - There was definitely a tie-in.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.840]   We're using Bing Maps a lot on the site.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.000]   We're using Bing Maps for all of the local games.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.960]   So for example, we'll do a bird's eye local image
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.200]   of the starting point for the scavenger hunt,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.120]   which has been great.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.080]   And for us, that was actually a really nice local tie-in
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.080]   because while Redmond isn't local,
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.480]   their bird's eye images all come from Picometry.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.680]   And Picometry is a Rochester based company.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.960]   So that for us, we've tried to, you know,
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.280]   to sort of eat our own dog food as much as possible
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.360]   to be as local as possible in all of our content,
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.880]   all of our video content comes from a local TV station,
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.440]   all of our images come from the Democrat
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.760]   and Chronicle photographers.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.600]   And so having Picometry from the Bing Maps was great.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.920]   If we'd had, you know, I should say that we did this
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.000]   on a budget of nothing with no staff assigned to it.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.640]   So we have begged, borrowed, and stolen everything
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.880]   that we needed to make this happen along the way.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.920]   So there are a lot of things we would have done differently
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.280]   or more of if we had had resources to work with.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.960]   So there are other ways we would have loved
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.400]   to have involved things like better local search,
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.280]   better integration of news and video and things like that.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.760]   We've learned an enormous amount doing this.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.680]   And moving forward, we'll do some other stuff.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.720]   But for now, the major being integration for us
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.600]   has been the maps.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.920]   And, you know, I have to give them major props,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.760]   A, for giving us some money to help keep the lights on,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.040]   and B, for saying, sure, of course you can go
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.080]   on this week in Google.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.920]   So.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.840]   - Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.600]   Very, very cool.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.560]   I'm happy to hear that they helped you out,
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.720]   'cause it's a great project.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.960]   Are you gonna open source the plans for the game
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.840]   so that other newspapers can do the same?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.400]   I think, Ted, we talked about that at some point.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   - We had talked about that
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.160]   because we built this quickly and without resources,
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.280]   this is the version one of the underlying platform.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.440]   And I don't wanna open source it,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.120]   'cause I don't really think anybody else wants to work
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.720]   with it in the form that it's currently in.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.280]   It's one of these duct tape and string constructions
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.120]   where it's doing what it needs to do for right now.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.960]   But we've learned so much that, in fact,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.520]   my next round of this is gonna be to look for funding,
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.120]   either grant funding or business funding
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.280]   to build the robust platform, the scalable platform,
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.480]   that we could give to other people.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.640]   And absolutely we wanna make it available.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.240]   I mean, if it's only us that does it, that's not fun.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.800]   And we want everybody to do it.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.440]   And I know Gannette has been looking at it
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.640]   as something that they could use in other markets as well.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.280]   So once we can get a good version of it together,
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.960]   a solid version, the plan is absolutely to put it out there
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.880]   so that other people can work with it.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.720]   - That's fantastic. - What's exciting
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.600]   about this is that you have a newspaper company
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.480]   that's trying to increase engagement, do new things.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.000]   This week in the Great Hall, the people at Tiananmen Square
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.480]   in China, you had the head of the Associated Press,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.120]   Tom Curly and Rupert Murdoch, the head of the news corp,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.520]   both continuing this rant and rail against Google aggregators,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.240]   bloggers, calling them thieves, not understanding the link
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.760]   economy, not understanding the idea that the audience
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.040]   is the distributor of what they do.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.120]   And if they put themselves behind, I don't know,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.520]   a Great Wall, that they're gonna just cut themselves
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.560]   off from the world.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.520]   And so when you see these experiments like what you're doing
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.400]   and what is going on with that paper in Rochester,
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.480]   it's the exact opposite.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.160]   And we've gotta figure out how to spread the word
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.840]   that we need to build new relationships
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.760]   in new ways with the public.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.880]   - No key, by the way. - Absolutely.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.560]   - We're working with Nokia at the City University
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.520]   of New York where I teach on an assignment tool
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.480]   so that if you're at a work with Nokia at first,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.000]   we'll work eventually with everything,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.480]   where you can assign people in the field
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.000]   who happen to be near news events to take that picture
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.240]   or bring in that video or do other things.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.640]   And when the information comes in, metadata is attached.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.240]   What assignment it is, what story it is,
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.800]   plus the obvious things as the phone knows,
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.920]   where it was taken by, who and when.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.520]   And you start to get through a new idea
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.440]   of how we gather and share news using these mobile devices
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.040]   if we think, globally.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.120]   - I think for us, it was interesting,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.440]   the whole culture clash between academia
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.120]   and a commercial news organization
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.760]   was a challenge in and of itself.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.640]   But one of the things I hadn't realized
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.520]   till we started working closely with the paper
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.200]   is how much of a firewall there is
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.400]   and understandably between the business side of the paper
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.640]   and the news side of the paper.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.960]   And for us, what happened was the news side totally got it.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.600]   The VPN news was a huge supporter of this.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.280]   The managing editor was the main push for it there.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.440]   But the business people didn't quite get what we were doing.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.840]   Didn't really understand the way to monetize it.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.480]   So this has been a frustration for us
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.320]   because the news people aren't allowed to go out
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.360]   and ask for money because that takes the process.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.400]   But the business people didn't understand it well enough
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.160]   to really work with us on it.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.680]   And what we really wanna do after this is done,
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.120]   I mean, our role on the academic side is then to say,
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.640]   how do we make this understandable for the business people?
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.960]   How do we write this up in a way that they can make sense of it,
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.200]   that it's not just a bunch of words and buzzwords,
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.960]   but that it's actually a plan for how can you
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.760]   make this a part of your business plan?
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.360]   - Matt and Gina, do you play four square either of you?
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.640]   - I don't.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.480]   - I don't.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.160]   - It comes like one of those.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   - It's one end to speak.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.240]   It's similar, isn't it?
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.440]   I mean, I don't play it either.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.120]   And I feel like I'm left out of some game
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.640]   that's going on in Rochester.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   - Four Square seems like this great business in terms of,
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.360]   it's wonderful, especially for single people.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.800]   Like they joke about Facebook often started out kind of
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.160]   as a way for people to meet each other.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.920]   And if you base your product on women wanting to meet men
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.200]   and men wanting to meet women,
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.360]   that's not an awful business model.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.920]   But I'm married, so four square isn't whole.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.000]   Quite as much appeal to me.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.840]   So.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.680]   (laughing)
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680]   - I always feel so old.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.880]   I don't wanna broadcast my location,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.920]   and I'm just like, well, that just proves I'm getting old.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.240]   (laughing)
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   - Well, you know, we'll start to go--
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.840]   - I get your messages.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.000]   Go ahead, go ahead, let's--
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.400]   - We're getting lots of families and couples
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.480]   playing the game.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.400]   The newspaper said we wanna target young professionals,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.120]   but what we're really getting is,
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.200]   we have over 2,000 registered authenticated users,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.720]   but many of those represent groups of two, three,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.680]   or four people where whole families are playing together.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.440]   And I think that's one of the things that's important
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.160]   in areas that aren't New York City or San Francisco
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.280]   or Seattle, and that's the thing with four square
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.120]   is you have to live in a big city.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.480]   If I try to log into four square here in Rochester,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.000]   it says it looks like you're closer to New York
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.920]   than any place else.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.480]   So we'll check you in in New York City,
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.080]   which doesn't really help me all that much.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.080]   - So targeting the families and the couples here
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.680]   has been really, really exciting for us
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.800]   that we're getting multi-generational use of the game.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.200]   - Well, the thing that I think could sell
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.560]   to the business guys at the paper is Google this week,
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.920]   maybe Matt, you can explain this better than I can,
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   added more rich ad functionality to adsense on mobile devices.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.040]   Eric Schmidt has said in the past
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.240]   that Google will end up making more money on mobile
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.080]   than it makes on the web,
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.280]   more money than God on the web.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.240]   So mobile has a huge priority.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.280]   Matt, do you know anything about where this is headed?
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.640]   - You know, I just know that there's a lot
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.200]   of different functionality for mobile.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.680]   If you think about it, things are still in flux.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.920]   So there's applications, there's potentially flash,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.000]   there's things like banner ads,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.840]   and I think until things are more settled,
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.480]   you want to support as much functionality as possible.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.640]   So different formats of ads, different sizes of ads,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.280]   different ways for people to sort of fetch
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   and get metrics and analytics on their ads,
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.640]   all those sorts of things.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.040]   So I think, as I recall, this most recent launch
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.640]   sort of basically increases the number of options
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.480]   that people have.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.960]   So if you're writing an application
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.280]   or if you're working on a mobile device as a developer,
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.760]   you can sort of offer a wider or a different variety
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.880]   of potential ad choices.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.000]   And eventually, you know, the world will sort of settle on
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   what we think as the standard way
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.760]   that people expect to get mobile ads.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.200]   But until that happens, I think it makes sense to be
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.920]   as open as possible and explore that space quite a bit.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.520]   - I don't want to feel that.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.320]   The question is, since you're the chief cop of spam,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.760]   does mobile have an advantage in the spam world
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.080]   because identity is set or does it have the same perils?
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.120]   Is there anything else?
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.080]   - You know, it's really funny because when people ask me
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.440]   about mobile spam, mostly they're worried about
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.960]   what if I show different content to mobile phones
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.000]   than to desktops, which is natural and is perfectly fine.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.120]   But yeah, when there is identity, when there is location,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.360]   it's harder to fake things.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.440]   You know, you can't pretend to be in Seattle
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.400]   when you're really in Bulgaria or China or something like that.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.840]   So there's also the fact that there's usually
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   a billing relationship, you know,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.400]   someone has to pay for that phone.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.600]   So they're a little bit harder to fake.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.280]   So even if you go and sign up for Gmail, for example,
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.280]   oftentimes we will offer the option to SMS,
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.720]   a pin code to you.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.840]   And then that just sort of says, you know what?
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.600]   It's hard to get a lot of different phone numbers.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.160]   It's hard to get the ability to use
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   a lot of different phone numbers.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.920]   So a lot of sites, not only Google, I think,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.120]   probably Craigslist and other sites also sort of
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.880]   have looked at using phone numbers or mobile cell phones
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.360]   as a way to sort of cut down on some of that spam
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.200]   and it can work very well.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.680]   - Indeed, I remember lately, Elk confessed a few weeks ago
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.080]   that he needed phone numbers.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.000]   Do I think if I remember, get Gmail addresses
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.440]   to be able to get various wave invitations, right Gina?
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.880]   - Yeah, I think he said he needed separate phone numbers
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.400]   for different voice accounts, which makes sense.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.760]   You know, just this week, I signed up for Google App Engine,
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.040]   which is a developer tool.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.360]   And in order to do so, I had to give it my cell phone number
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.440]   and it SMSed me a verification code.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.200]   And you know, because they're really, they're doling out,
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.880]   you know, CPU bandwidth, database, you know, disk space.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.560]   So I guess they kind of have to verify, you know,
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.160]   one app engine account for, you know, per developer.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.240]   So yeah, that's pretty interesting.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.960]   But the thing is, I kind of want to be able to fake
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.200]   my location if I want to.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.280]   Like I want to be able to say, maybe not that I'm in
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.320]   San Francisco if I'm in Bulgaria, but I like the idea
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.160]   being able to say I'm in the San Diego area versus,
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.320]   you know, I'm on this, the corner of the street
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.880]   and this street just for, you know, for obvious privacy
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.680]   reasons. - Right, yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.360]   And in fact, if you go to Google Latitude,
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.400]   we have the ability to not only say,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.360]   don't just pinpoint me to within a, you know,
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.240]   a tiny little area, but say I'm at this,
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.000]   I'm at this city, for example, and you have the ability
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.400]   to go to a webpage and say, you know,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.440]   I might be in San Diego, but I can say that I'm
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.280]   in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is really quite helpful.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.560]   So there's granularity, not just in who you choose
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.360]   to share information with, but also there's granularity
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   and whether you show information and where you say you are
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.400]   and at what level of detail, which I think is very healthy.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.160]   And I think the latitude folks have really thought about
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.720]   how to make that a useful functionality
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.600]   so that people don't feel those sorts of concerns.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.280]   At the same time, the ability to do SMS can be kind of helpful
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.560]   just to know you're sort of talking to a real person.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.000]   So for example, Google's local business center
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.400]   used to send postcards and sometimes still can,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.400]   but you can also get an SMS or, you know,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.920]   get a phone call that says your pin is
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.080]   and now you go to a webpage and you type in this number.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.480]   And that's just really helpful because the spammers find it
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.680]   harder to get a lot of different phone numbers.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.320]   - What's interesting too, Matt, is the,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.040]   back to this notion of the annotated world.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.440]   Gina, I think if I could not only decide when to say
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.840]   how accurate my location is, but also when to associate it
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.040]   with data, if it's some thought of mine,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.680]   I don't want geo associated with it.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.400]   But if I'm gonna review a restaurant,
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.040]   I want geo associated with it.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.800]   If I'm gonna send in a news story to Liz's colleague
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.320]   newspaper, they're gonna require me to say where I am
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.960]   to kind of prove that I'm there and that the picture is legit.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.800]   - Right, right.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.960]   - And then it becomes a question as like,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.480]   how accurate then is that data?
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.440]   If it's easy to fuzz it, you know,
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.080]   can a newspaper really use that as an eyewitness account?
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   Can a reporter use that as an eyewitness account?
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.320]   If it's just got a couple of, you know,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.040]   longitude and latitude coordinates attached to it,
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.240]   that it wouldn't, you know, wouldn't be that easy to change,
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.640]   you know, that difficult to change.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.600]   - You also need to just turn on the verified geo
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.640]   when you feel you need it and just turn it off
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.800]   and say what you wanna say.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.560]   And if people can see which is which,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.320]   you know, that seems to solve some problems.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.200]   - That's true, that is true.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.920]   - This ties into the discussion,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.800]   I think two weeks ago about Twitter and geo.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.720]   This week we also had discussion that Twitter is talking
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.840]   to both Google and I think Bing, right?
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.240]   About say the rumors about, about
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.680]   turning over the database.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.480]   And what does this do to the potential of live search?
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.840]   Whether it's Google or Bing, I don't care.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.400]   But since Twitter is right now,
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.040]   that is that putting Twitter in the cloud?
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.000]   Is that kind of making Twitter irrelevant in this?
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.600]   What would that mean if it happens?
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.720]   - Well, and I can't speak to what deals, you know,
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.640]   Twitter might be going on,
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.160]   not that I would even know them as one thing,
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.800]   but it is sort of interesting that, you know,
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.000]   Google and Bing both crawl Twitter.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.840]   So, you know, I don't know what percentage
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.200]   of Twitter were able to crawl,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.360]   but we are able to crawl a fairly large amount.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.680]   And to the extent that you expect anybody
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.600]   that's important would get retweeted.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   And so you'll sort of see that information.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.080]   I think that there's definitely the case that
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.400]   we can already crawl a pretty interesting fraction
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.600]   enough to sort of do some fun real time stuff.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.880]   But, you know, whenever you go to Twitter
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.480]   and you type something in that goes into Twitter's database.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.600]   And so, you know, even if you have a feed,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.320]   you can't change that feed page.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.240]   You can't point it to a hub or Pub/Sub hub or anything like that,
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.920]   at least not by default or any way that I know.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.840]   So it's in Twitter's databases.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.120]   It's in Twitter silo.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.440]   And so it would be up to them about how to release that data.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.360]   - Right. - Do you know
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.280]   what do you think the impact is?
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.120]   - Well, so, okay.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.560]   So let's think about live Twitter search results
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.240]   in Google results.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.040]   Well, first you have geo data when they turn on geo, right?
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.080]   So regular web pages don't generally have geo data,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.120]   but Twitter search results too do.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.640]   And so a situation, this is a good,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.680]   this is a situation I always use or an example I always use
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.920]   with Twitter search results.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.800]   I'm on the West Coast, so American Idol
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.760]   are different reality shows air three hours earlier
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.600]   on the East Coast.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.400]   If I search for American Idol winner,
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.680]   you know, at 6 p.m. my time when I know it's out on the East Coast,
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.040]   in regular Google search results,
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.600]   and Matt, you could correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.400]   you generally can't find the winner before it's aired.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.120]   But if Twitter search results are integrated there,
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.440]   I'll know the winner before it airs.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.880]   So you just get that, you know, that instant answer.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.840]   - Yeah, it's historically Google likes to do algorithmic stuff.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.480]   We don't tend to do a one box that says,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   okay, here's who won American Idol
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.280]   or who's who is winning the Emmys.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.120]   That sort of thing.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.640]   Although this week we did do a poison control.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.160]   So it turns out there's one single 1-800 number
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   that works for all of the United States.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.360]   So if anybody types in poison control,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.320]   they'll get a little one box.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.160]   So we don't do this very often.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.480]   But for example, earlier today,
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.320]   I Twitter that I was going to be on Twig later today.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.840]   And just doing a search for Matt cuts this week in Google,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.720]   I see it one, two, three, four, result number five.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.880]   I see, you know, my snippet.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   I'm going to be on this week in Google later today.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.800]   So we've already crawled my page on Twitter and seen that.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.240]   So we were relatively good at finding fresh stuff pretty quickly.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.680]   Certainly Twitter has got it first, but.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.440]   - Yeah, I think Google's pretty good at search.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.080]   I don't know in general.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.320]   - Well, but no, but I think you're right,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.480]   you know, Google's always been weak and live.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.360]   It needs content to ferment, as I say, like wider issues.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   - And there's metadata too.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.960]   Like Matt, you know, Matt, I assume that they're at Twitter accounts
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.440]   that like echo your tweets or maybe even modify them.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.200]   Like if you had a verified account, I mean,
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.400]   there's certain metadata that Twitter has in their database
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.960]   that could be available to Google.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.200]   I mean, I suppose that they could embed it in the page
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.760]   in a certain way that Google's, you know,
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.680]   that the Google bot would get anyway,
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.280]   because, you know, the Google bot's pretty good, as we said.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.880]   But it seems like it might be, I don't know,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.320]   you know, you have identity, geo information,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.040]   and it could, it might show up a little bit faster.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.440]   I don't know, I'd be interested to know,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.640]   I mean, what is the lag time between something,
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.840]   a tweet gets published on Twitter.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.720]   - I think you have a pretty popular Twitter account,
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.280]   and it shows up on Google about how long you think that takes.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.000]   - You know, I don't think it takes very long.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.040]   Certainly, if Twitter has the fire hose,
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.800]   they have the full database.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.480]   And so, you know, any information that any random person tweets,
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.200]   they have it very, very quickly because they get it directly.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.080]   But there was a really good interview that came out in business week
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.920]   this week with Amit Singhal, who's my office mate.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.600]   He's the head of Google's core ranking.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.920]   And he talked for about two or three paragraphs
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.560]   about our philosophy of real time, of live,
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.920]   whatever you want to call it.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.440]   And what he basically said is that Twitter is a very large chunk
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.800]   of what gets produced in terms of real time information.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.840]   But suppose there's an embargo, you know, and at 9 p.m.,
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.240]   something goes live and the embargo is lifted.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.760]   If somebody's worked really hard to write a good blog post
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.720]   and at 9.01, they hit the submit button.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   In our opinion, that's basically real time as well.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.480]   So our philosophy on ranking tends to be more or less a window
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.520]   to sort of say, okay, show me very recent results.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.440]   So for example, if you do a search,
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.520]   you can click the show options link.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.600]   And then we'll show you the ability to see things
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.120]   with recent results, essentially.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.880]   So you can search past 24 hours or even the past hour.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.760]   So historically, Twitter absolutely is where a lot
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.360]   of real time content gets created.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.640]   But it's not the only place.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.320]   You know, a good blog post can be considered real time
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.400]   in our opinion.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.080]   And so we sort of provide those options in our philosophies
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.640]   more along the lines of rank anything useful on the web
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.360]   that looks pretty reputable within a very short time window.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.480]   And that can be considered real time.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.320]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.480]   Both of you have seen tinker.com.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.080]   Tinker was started by Glam.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.320]   Glam is the largest women's brand network online.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   It kind of, I think, blew up the model of media online
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.600]   by creating networks instead of only in content,
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.720]   which is a model for news.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.480]   But that's subject of another day.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.080]   They got all fascinated with the idea of the live web
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   and what was going on here.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:08.280]   So they started tinker.com, which categorizes Twitter news feeds,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.680]   now associates it with Reuters news.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.600]   And I dinner with Samir Arora, the CEO of Glam this week.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.680]   And they're finding, of course, no surprise
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.480]   that the news is coming much faster from Twitter
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.000]   than from other sources, including Google News,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.920]   so that now they're exchanging feeds with Reuters
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.600]   because Reuters wants the heads up to news
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.920]   that Twitter provides and tinker wants the context
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.400]   that Reuters provides.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.360]   - Right, I mean, I think the embargo example
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.960]   that that Matt Cave is a really good one, right?
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.240]   Because that blog post is written.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.120]   And at 9 p.m., the published button gets pressed.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.560]   But for the most part of things that happen,
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   things that don't have that kind of planning or lead time,
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.640]   Twitter news is gonna be out there faster
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.880]   just 'cause it takes a lot less time
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.840]   than a right 140 characters, right?
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.440]   - And Twitter is fantastic.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.080]   I mean, one thing that's wonderful
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.320]   is how Twitter lowered the barrier
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.640]   so that regular people are creating and making content.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.040]   So if a bear goes crazy at the zoo
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.960]   or if a guy in downtown Palo Alto is walking around
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.240]   with a gun, which I've seen both those examples,
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.080]   you'll have one out of 20 or whatever the fraction is
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.640]   of the people will have a Twitter account.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.880]   And so absolutely a ton of content does get created there.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.720]   And Twitter is fantastic to find out,
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.040]   especially about a breaking event
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.880]   or when something just happened.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.320]   I think where it can get a little bit more muddy
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.120]   is 10 hours after that tsunami
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.080]   or 10 hours after that breaking event.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.000]   And then when you search if you're only sorting by date,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.080]   then you'll tend to get whatever one random person
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.800]   happened to say about that.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.760]   Whereas you might wanna get useful links
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.200]   and okay, what are the resources that are the biggest source
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.240]   of reputable information and stuff like that?
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.080]   - That's where geo definitely is.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.800]   - It's definitely a bit of a panic.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.640]   - Yeah.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.160]   - When geo comes in, you're gonna have some sense
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.760]   of what's happening if it's legit.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.320]   And then it becomes a matter of people talking about it
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.680]   rather than telling about it.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.800]   - Right, take the example of Obama though.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.000]   That doesn't have as much of a geo focus.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.280]   So I heard about Obama getting the Nobel Prize on Twitter
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   'cause I happen to be surfing there first.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.320]   And so finding out a breaking piece
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.520]   of information is fantastic.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.960]   But then a day later, you'll probably,
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.040]   if you search for Obama Nobel Prize,
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.920]   you'll get more or less random sampleings
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.400]   of what people are saying.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.840]   So it's always this trade off of real time
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.320]   versus perspective, I think.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.920]   - Well, it's a gathering mechanism
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.440]   for gathering news from witnesses.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.360]   It's a distribution mechanism for sharing that news.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.920]   And then it's a discussion mechanism, right?
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.760]   - Yeah.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.800]   - Right, I mean that news got pushed to you, right?
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.200]   Matt, you happen to be on Twitter
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.520]   and that news got pushed to you.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.080]   You didn't know what to search for it.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   One question about integrating Twitter search results
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.360]   in Bing or Google, I mean, would for example,
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.120]   probably this is a question you can answer,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.280]   but will Google use Twitter metadata
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.080]   like the number of followers you have
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.920]   or whether or not you're a verified account
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.320]   or how many tweets you have?
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.760]   Would you use that to rank results to mean
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.040]   with somebody with a verified account
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.160]   and 50,000 followers and very few followees or friends,
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.000]   would that person get a higher ranking in results
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.320]   theoretically?
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.400]   - Right now we don't.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.600]   So what we find is the people that have a lot of followers
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.440]   tend to attract a lot of links anyway.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.920]   And the important Twitter posts or micro tweets,
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.240]   whatever you want to call them, micro blogging items,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.440]   those tend to go ahead and attract links.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.240]   So you could certainly look at a lot of different factors
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.880]   and Twitter would have a lot of it judging anything
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.280]   from when someone joined Twitter
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.800]   to how many replies they get,
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.320]   to how many followers they have.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.480]   So you could probably build a pretty good source
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   of reputation for an individual Twitter user.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.000]   And even if you're not Twitter,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.960]   you could probably do a relatively good job of that.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.480]   I'm sure that some of the real time search engines
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.560]   try to do that.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.520]   With Google, just going purely by PageRank
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.120]   gets us about 90, 95% of the way there.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.320]   So we don't do anything special or different
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.600]   in ranking Twitter pages or Facebook pages
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.160]   or any social media like that.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.440]   - Right, because when you reply to someone on Twitter,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.320]   the metadata is says in reply to this tweet
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.200]   and it's a link back to that individual tweet.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.760]   So that would contribute to PageRank.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.000]   So PageRank scales is what you're saying.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:15.920]   - PageRank scales.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.200]   - And the nice thing is it's not just replies
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.560]   or links within Twitter,
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.720]   it's also a lot of people will link to tweets
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.480]   or friend feed will link to a specific tweet.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   And so just from crawling away,
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.720]   you can find a lot of good information that way.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.560]   - Right, right.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.800]   - Speak before we get off Twitter.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.000]   It was the oddest that we had,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.080]   by the way, I don't think we had a Google downtime this week.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.120]   We had Twitter half down.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.800]   I don't know if you experienced this in your time zone,
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.120]   but I found that it was only,
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.440]   I was only seeing my own tweets.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.520]   I thought it was a new killer rap
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.560]   that I can talk to myself,
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.520]   who needs the world.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.360]   We heard a story about what this down was
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.200]   because it was so strange.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.160]   It was only parts of what we're down.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.520]   I could see replies to me,
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.480]   but I couldn't see my feed.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.400]   - Yeah, I think the status blog,
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.200]   the Twitter status blog said that an edge case
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.560]   with a particular service that Twitter uses
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.680]   had happened and something had gone down.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.800]   And yeah, that's what happened to me.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.520]   My timeline was just stale.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.320]   I saw my own tweets, but no one else's.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.360]   I saw replies.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.200]   It was weird.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.400]   It was like everybody left the room.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.640]   It was like everybody left the party.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.480]   But it wasn't down.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.680]   - Is it something I said?
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.880]   Yeah, that was definitely interesting,
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.720]   interesting down edge.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.400]   I'd rather just have the fail whale straight up,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.880]   you know, than that happen again.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.480]   - Matt, you talked about that business week article
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.560]   before about Google and Search.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.880]   And I know you tweeted it this week.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.560]   And there were a lot of really interesting things
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.960]   in that about how Google tests.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.040]   Can you talk about that for a few minutes?
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.320]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.480]   So there was an interview with Scott Huffman,
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.640]   who's the head of our evaluation team.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.960]   And Rob Huff, who wrote the article,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.400]   did a very good job of drilling down
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.760]   and saying give more examples, give more examples.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.800]   So we basically talked about how we evaluate search quality.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.440]   So for example, one sort of secret that I gave
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.240]   was that I can always keep a notebook in my back pocket.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.640]   So if I'm at a local arts fair,
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.120]   I'm collecting the names of these little tiny mom
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.720]   and pop artists, the ones who have AOL email addresses
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.800]   who are not necessarily all that savvy.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.920]   And so if you search for their name and, you know,
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.200]   photography or whatever, you want to return their website.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.440]   So they don't even know it,
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.120]   but we're trying to check our quality by looking at
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.840]   whether we return these little tiny mom and pop businesses
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.120]   that maybe only have one or two links
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   or don't even have any links.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.280]   And then Scott talked a little bit about,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.920]   you know, we'll do AB testing.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.760]   So we'll sort of show you one set of results most of the time,
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.920]   but a very small percentage of users
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.280]   will get an experiment.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.400]   And if the click through is radically better
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.120]   on this experimental group or radically worse,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.760]   then that tells us something as well.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   So we have a whole bunch of different experiments
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.960]   that we run as well as different query sets.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.520]   And so if you expect a certain result to show up
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.840]   and it doesn't show up,
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.520]   somebody usually finds out about that
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.600]   and starts immediately debugging and figures out,
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.920]   okay, is this a site down or was it something on our side?
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.600]   And we find a lot of bugs before anybody even notices
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.520]   that they're bugs.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.040]   - Now, one thing that surprised me
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.640]   was the human impact of this.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.800]   I think it's a surprise, Rob as well,
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.120]   that you have a lot of human testers
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:16.320]   doing these quality control checks around the world
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.200]   for a not bad hourly rate, by the way.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.040]   How does that work?
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.200]   - Yeah.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.120]   The idea is whenever we have a new change,
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.400]   we'd like to know whether it's an improvement or not.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.080]   And so in order to do that,
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.600]   we'll actually create a production system
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.440]   that can rank the results differently.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.480]   And then we basically show the two results side by side
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.040]   and we say, okay, you as an expert raider,
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.080]   you're in Japan, you actually live in Japan,
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   you know what should be the result for this hospital
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.160]   or for this particular query,
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.880]   which set of results is better.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.200]   And it's blind, so they don't know what they're evaluating,
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.640]   they don't know which side is which,
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.840]   they don't know anything about it.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.520]   All they know is, okay, I think left side is better,
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.320]   right side is better, whatever.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.960]   And so by having those sorts of ratings,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.480]   those sort of side by side ratings in really dozens
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.200]   of different languages, we're able to spot problems.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   So you don't just roll out a change
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.480]   because it works well in English,
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.680]   because it might break something in Chinese or Spanish
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.400]   or French or Italian or German.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.800]   So there's a ton of different raters who help us out
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.960]   just by sort of evaluating the results side by side
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.360]   and saying, I think this is better,
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.960]   or I think that this is worse.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:28.080]   - Do those result in small modifications as you go
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.280]   or they become part of the next big build?
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.840]   - We tend to do things in small incremental changes.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.040]   So if you look at Bing, they tend to launch
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.160]   on more like every six months sort of schedule.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.160]   We tend to launch more on the order of six to eight
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.560]   to 10 things per week.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.240]   So we have a meeting every week every Thursday
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.680]   where we sort of talk about all the proposed changes
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.040]   and either approve them or table them
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.320]   or send them back to get more details
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.640]   or to tweak the algorithm a little bit better.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.040]   So in the same way you could think of a car as a machine,
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.200]   there is one algorithm that sort of ranks
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.600]   all of Google search results,
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.120]   but a car is composed of a bunch of different parts
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.080]   and those parts are also algorithms.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.120]   So we do try to make these changes very incrementally
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.680]   and most of the time people don't even notice,
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.200]   which is a little bit discouraging.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.680]   You make some huge improvement in how you do Chinese
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.640]   or Italian and sure people like the results better,
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.600]   but they don't really,
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.960]   it's not such a huge difference that they notice.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.120]   And so what we do is we've just started to blog
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.080]   a little bit more about sort of even just the UI changes
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.120]   that we've done in the last week or two.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.320]   We've realized that unless we talk about
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.040]   some of these changes, some of which are subtle,
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.320]   even if they're involving these or interface,
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.480]   people won't always notice them.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.200]   - How often do you have to roll back a change?
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.360]   'Cause you have an oops.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.720]   - It's pretty rare.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.200]   And in fact, it's very rare.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:58.360]   What's more likely is you have a binary that goes out
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.440]   that has some problem with performance
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.600]   or maybe you found a way that one query
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.080]   could crash that binary.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.600]   So we do a bunch of stuff to avoid having the problems
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.640]   of downtime or brownouts or going to Google
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.600]   and nothing shows up.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.280]   Those tend to be the sorts of things
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.240]   that you send out a test binary
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.760]   and you find out there's a problem
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.240]   and you have to revert that.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.840]   As far as search quality changes,
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.240]   we do a bunch of evaluation before things launched
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.680]   to make sure that it's safe.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.000]   We do occasionally roll back,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.920]   but it's really not that often.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.680]   One of our traditions here on Twig
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.360]   is to not talk about Google Books
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.240]   'cause we don't have Steve Avadonathian here.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.480]   I tried to get Steve Avadon this week.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.800]   We didn't, but I think we have to at least hit the topic
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.160]   a little bit, by the way, my son Jake says,
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.080]   the Google Book Search discussion is boring.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.160]   Never talk about it.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   (laughing)
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.280]   So he really says.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.920]   But this week we did have Sergei Brin's op ed
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.760]   in the New York Times defending Google Book Search.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.200]   And I think, man, it was you who sent me a sort of a tweet
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.880]   saying you had a reason to know why he really wrote it.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.960]   Well, just the fact that he made this joke,
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.240]   you know, that something limited consumer choice
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.240]   like consumer choice in unicorns is limited,
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.520]   which is just a very Sergei thing to say.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.280]   He was essentially making the point that
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.240]   in the same way that unicorns don't really exist,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.880]   there really wasn't any choice before you had the ability
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.720]   to get access to these books using Google Book Search
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.720]   because unless you happen to live right next
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.400]   to a major research library,
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.800]   there was no way you were going to be able
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.680]   to get to see that book.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:30.320]   So that was most of the op ed was very well reasoned
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.000]   and very polite and he quoted a few historical books,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.800]   which was fun, but you could see a little bit
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.080]   of Sergei come through in that sentence.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.880]   - That unicorn line is my favorite for sure.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.040]   Sorry, I'm like that unicorn line like got me.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.040]   I have to say, I have to say that op ed convinced me
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.560]   I thought it was pretty even handed
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:50.840]   and well written and well reasoned.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.120]   Actually, Liz, I'm interested to know
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.280]   what you think about the Google Books situation
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.000]   and if you've been keeping up on it.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.840]   - All right, so you're going to put me on the spot here
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.080]   because I'm the librarian and I've been so busy building
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.880]   and running a game for the past three months
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.600]   that I can't do anything else.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.640]   So I'm on your first thing.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.480]   - I know, I know the library and this is where I'm asking.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.640]   - And get caught up.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.520]   - Well, I won't put you on the spot
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.080]   because I know you've been running the game,
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.800]   but I know that you're coming from Microsoft
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.040]   and the whole Google digitizing all the books in the world.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.680]   I'm curious to know what the librarian thinks of that,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.600]   but I won't be on the spot if you're not.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.440]   - I mean, I can respond.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.240]   I can't respond to anything new
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.040]   that's going on there right now,
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.640]   but I can give my general sense,
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.840]   which is that it makes me really, really nervous
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.360]   to have all that content centralized
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.360]   and owned by a single entity.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.240]   And one of the things I love about libraries
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:50.240]   is their deeply decentralized approach to content.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.840]   So the librarian in me worries a lot
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.040]   about all of the content being controlled
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:04.280]   in one central source instead of by consortiums
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.880]   or collaborative groups that have competing stakes
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.480]   and therefore some incentive to address each other's needs.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.280]   So there's a low level discomfort for me
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.440]   of commercially owned books.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.040]   - We still have to get Siva on.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.600]   I agree with Eugene and Matt.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.560]   I liked the op-ed, I said so on Twitter.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.200]   And then Siva came in, I can't find it right now,
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.400]   but he went onto my Facebook page where the tweet had gone
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.240]   and had a little rant about it.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.320]   So we will get him on.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.600]   Another tradition here at This Week in Google
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.840]   is that we have to talk about wave.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.080]   So a genius suggestion, let's immigrate a new feature
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.040]   called This Week in Wave.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.280]   (laughing)
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.240]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.640]   I know, Jeff, I know you and Matt are on wave.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.520]   Liz, have you gotten into the wave preview?
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.080]   Are you using wave?
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   - I received my first invitation into wave on Friday.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:04.840]   And I have not yet accepted it.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.520]   I tried to accept it from my phone
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.400]   and it said you absolutely may not do this on your phone.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.840]   Go home and use your computer.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.880]   - You don't wanna do it on your phone.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.240]   - So I'm, I actually, as you started talking,
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.280]   I said, oh, I should pull up that invitation and log in.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   But I'll be honest with you.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   I have no idea from anything that I've read
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.800]   why I want to be in it.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.360]   So if you could enlighten me
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.480]   as to why this would be useful to me, that'd be lovely.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.080]   - There's a fantastic website.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:31.920]   What's it called?
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:36.080]   It's a wave easier to understand than wave or?
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.840]   - Yeah, it's easier to understand than Sarah Palin.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.000]   - Yeah, easier to understand than,
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.240]   or what is the actual URL?
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.080]   - I'm going down right now.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.240]   It's in our feed.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.240]   Oh, where the hell is it?
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.920]   - Damn, hold on, what was I?
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.120]   - Anyway, it is a website that basically compares Google Wave
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.440]   against a whole host of inexplicable things,
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.960]   like Sarah Palin, like women was in there.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.800]   I don't know really know what the--
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.440]   - Here we go, I got a tech crunch.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:12.800]   230 people, 49% said Google Wave was easier
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.560]   to understand than Sarah Palin, which was 51%.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.920]   Google Wave is easier to understand
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.040]   that Obama's Nobel Peace Prize,
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.840]   than the United States Tax Code, and Scientology,
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.760]   than women.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.000]   And that was it for this suggestion.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.840]   - It's basically like--
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.280]   - Yeah, Google Wave is hard, but I think that,
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   I wrote a post I'll send to you also the LA Times
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.160]   had a good feature about how Google Wave
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.080]   can have a real impact on news.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.760]   It's collaborative, it's real time.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.200]   A closed group can collaborate on it,
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.960]   and soon they'll be able to publish to the web.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.360]   So I think what you can blow the brains
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.360]   of your friends down there at the Rochester Democrat
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.320]   with an idea of a new, when you turn them
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.960]   to what they should go next is two-way news,
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.400]   and collaborating between journalists and witnesses,
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.920]   Wave is gonna be an incredible tool, we think.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:04.560]   - I love your eyes, I actually--
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.560]   - I see a couple of people from our newspaper
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.200]   as I just logged into it, and in my contact list,
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.680]   I see a couple of people from our local newspaper
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.440]   already in there and playing with it.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.720]   So I will say that as someone who has had to,
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.360]   because it makes me so depressed,
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.920]   stop reading any comment posted to a newspaper article,
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.720]   I am hopeful that something that's perhaps
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.720]   tied to a more permanent identity
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.880]   than what most newspaper comments offer
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.080]   could perhaps improve the quality of discourse,
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.080]   because after the election, I just said,
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.760]   that's it, I can never again read another comment
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.200]   on a newspaper article, 'cause they're just awful.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   The quality of discourse is pathetic on most comments.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.680]   - You're right, but the problem is I think
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.080]   that that is still kind of a centralized view of news
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   that says, okay, here's what we've done,
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.800]   now enough about you, comment on what we've done.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.080]   When that's all you allow is interactivity,
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.320]   whereas if we really, truly turn to collaboration,
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.240]   if we have projects and journalism
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.120]   that we do together with the community
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.560]   and try to accomplish something, Wikipedia-like,
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.080]   that's a whole different kind of respect for the community
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.560]   and a different kind of collaboration,
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:18.880]   and I think that's the next part of my wave of interaction.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.920]   Gina, have you done anything new with Wave
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.080]   since we last talked?
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.440]   - Well, last week we were talking about
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.640]   how difficult or easy it is to extend Wave,
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.000]   and this week I actually dove into the API
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.360]   and made my first Wave bot,
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.440]   so there are two ways to extend Wave, bots and gadgets,
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.200]   and yes, Wave is complex, and many things are,
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.080]   or not many things are easy to understand than that,
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.520]   and the website is actually easier to understand than Wave.com.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:46.000]   It's basically a hot or not for how confusing Wave can be,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.400]   which I found thoroughly amusing,
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.880]   but I made my first bot this week,
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.120]   and there's a Java API and a Python API.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.040]   It was super simple, it was an afternoon's worth of work.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.720]   It doesn't do anything very useful,
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.440]   I haven't done anything very complex with it yet,
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.320]   but yeah, I'm kind of hopped up,
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.600]   I'm jazzed up about Wave right now,
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.000]   'cause I did a little bit of development,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.480]   and a few of my friends are in,
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.760]   and actually Jeff and I used Wave before this show,
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.080]   'cause we were both very nervous about Leo not being here,
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.360]   so we were frantically waving together,
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.640]   like, "Oh, what are we gonna talk about?"
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.000]   Okay.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.160]   - It was just true of us, it worked pretty well, didn't it?
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.560]   - It did work very quite well,
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.800]   and it was really fun to watch your cursor dancing around,
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.960]   you know, 20 minutes before the show,
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.400]   and to add to different sections,
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.080]   I thought it worked actually quite well,
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.720]   and I've got a couple of real documents and outlines
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.640]   that I'm working on with coworkers now in Wave,
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.360]   'cause I have the privilege of working with nerds
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.880]   that actually got into the preview,
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.720]   and I'm liking it, I'm liking it very much.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.480]   And I think it is still very complex
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.480]   and difficult to understand, but I'm into it.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.080]   And Matt, since you're at Google,
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:46.480]   I wanted to ask you this question,
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.320]   which is basically the same question I asked you about,
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.520]   Android a few shows ago.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.080]   Internally at Google, how much is Wave in used?
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.680]   Does every employee have an invite?
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.800]   Are people ditching Gmail for it?
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.560]   Is it, how do you see it happening inside the castle?
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.240]   - Yeah, yeah, definitely one of the best things
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.000]   about Google that I just can't get enough of
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.320]   is the ability to dog food stuff before anybody else.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.200]   So if you're interested in that at Google,
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.880]   you can usually get access to fun stuff,
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.720]   things like Wave.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.840]   So there's a lot of people, especially in the early days
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.440]   of Wave, they said you can convert a whole team
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.440]   if you guys are all kind of willing to tackle it together.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.400]   And what I love is it's especially good for collaboration.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.040]   So if you're working on a document,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.440]   or there's something where you're both gonna be
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.480]   polishing it out, then it's fantastic.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.640]   And so there's a lot of people that have been using it for that.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.440]   Yeah, I sort of feel like I need to mount
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.320]   a spirited defense of Wave when everybody says
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.600]   it's all this super complex sort of stuff
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.360]   because the announcement video was about an hour,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.040]   but it was because they wanted to take you
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.480]   through all the features.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.920]   And I sort of feel like, okay,
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.040]   multiple people connect up to one server,
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.360]   they can chat in real time, and there has the ability
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.120]   in the server to sort of watch stuff go over the wire
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.200]   and add and augment and make things better.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.160]   And there's more structure.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.320]   So it's not just raw text.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.120]   You can add images, you can, you know,
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.520]   all that stuff is saved.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.480]   I feel like there is an essence of Wave,
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.880]   which some people have seen because they have friends,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.280]   like when you can collaborate,
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.840]   you can really start to see the potential,
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.880]   and when you can write a bot,
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.160]   you can really start to see part of the power.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.760]   So I think a few people are sort of judging
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.600]   by the current user interface,
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.640]   which is not really the most fair, you know?
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.440]   That's a good start, but I think the power is in sort
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.680]   of the idea and in the direction that they go.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.680]   Agreed, I'm sold.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.480]   You don't have to defend Wave to me, I'm sold.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.680]   I feel a little bit like everybody in my kind
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.320]   of productivity circles are like,
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.800]   this is just another distracting thing.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.160]   And I'm like, but it's so cool.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.040]   And, you know, it's gonna take some time,
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.080]   I think to get the elevator pitch right and to get,
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.120]   and for people to, I mean, it's only as good as, you know,
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.240]   who else is in it with you and who will collaborate with you.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.800]   And I think as people actually start to use it
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.280]   for things other than saying,
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.000]   hi, I'm waving, this is me waving,
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.560]   how do you use this, you know,
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.680]   the utility reveals itself.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.440]   - I think it's very RSS like in that way.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.840]   That people still don't know what it stands for.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.400]   And it doesn't matter what it stands for,
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.240]   you see it in all kinds of useful things
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.680]   and it really works.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.560]   And Liz, as a journalism teacher,
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.520]   I'm dying for someone to start developing
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.160]   news applications with this.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.760]   So get finished with the darn game and let's talk.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.360]   'Cause I think that you and your team,
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.800]   'cause it is collaborative, it is social,
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.600]   it's about creating new things,
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.520]   it's about taking the newspaper to the next step,
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.200]   we can make beautiful music together here Liz.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.040]   - All right, call me.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.760]   - All right, so we're gonna keep going
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.920]   in a moment with our other traditions of Twig.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.840]   But first, we have a word from Leo
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.720]   who has a word from our sponsor.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.080]   So let's see if Eric's ready to play that.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.920]   - Thanks guys, more Twig in a bit.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.120]   But first I have to tell you,
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.600]   I want to tell you about go to assist,
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.240]   go to assist, express.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.400]   I've been using, we use go to assist,
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.320]   the earlier version of go to assist way back when,
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   I think on the screen savers to help people.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   But really it has been redesigned,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.360]   it is a very great product for people
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.240]   who are in customer support or IT.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.400]   If you're, you know, there's nothing worse.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.240]   Believe me, I know better than anyone.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.760]   And trying to support people over the phone
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.040]   with go to assist, express,
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.920]   there's another way, a better way.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.160]   It's online tech support for your customers
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.360]   or clients over the internet.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.880]   You view and control another person's computer online.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.120]   Of course it's from Citrix,
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.160]   they know how to do this kind of remote access,
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   but this is designed specifically for IT pros.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.760]   You can fix a technical problem quickly
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.280]   and remotely without being there.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.240]   You can access files on the remote computer,
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.600]   transfer files from your computer to theirs
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.960]   to fix the problem, run up to eight unattended sessions
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.080]   at the same time or attended.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.680]   But the beauty of the eight sessions
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.800]   is you started to install, you started to fix a scan,
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.320]   moved to the next machine, moved to the next machine.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.280]   You never waiting for something to finish.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.120]   And your customers, no, it's unattended,
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.040]   they do not have to be there.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.440]   You do have full chat and so forth,
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.760]   so you can talk to them while you're working
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.120]   with their machine, but they don't have to be there.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.200]   Get a complete assay of the software on the system
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.120]   and on and on and on.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.040]   All sorts of great features built in for you
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.400]   from go to assist, I want you to try it now.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.600]   Go to gototowassist.com/twig
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.800]   and try it absolutely free for 30 days.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   Go to assist.com/twig, try it free for 30 days
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.600]   you'll see you'll be a support hero.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.640]   Go to assist.com/twig we thank
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.840]   and for their support of this week in Google.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.320]   Now back to Jeff and Gina in the gang.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.240]   - Thank you Leo, we miss you.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.000]   But we probably have a great time eating kebabs
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.880]   in Dubai for TEDx.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.960]   All right, we're gonna go down to our final traditions now,
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.920]   which is the tip of the week, the number of the week
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.560]   and Gina suggests we bring back the wish list.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.000]   So Gina, why don't you start with your tip over the week?
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.560]   - My tip of the week is actually a feature
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.640]   that came out a few weeks ago,
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.280]   but I think we were too preoccupied with wave
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.400]   during the show to mention it.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.400]   The new version of Picasa, Picasa 3.5
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.480]   has facial recognition built in.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.920]   And I photo has had this for a while.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.320]   I've never been a big iPhoto fan,
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   but I was really excited to see it come out in Picasa.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.120]   I've upgraded to Picasa 3.5.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.200]   It scans gigabytes and gigabytes of photos
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.800]   that I have since 1998.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.520]   And it does a creepily good job of identifying faces
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.560]   and grouping your pictures by face.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.960]   For me, it did better on adults than children.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.320]   Like I have pictures of my nephews
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.760]   and when they're babies, they all kind of look similar.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.840]   So you can correct what faces it attach,
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.280]   it identifies and categorizes as a person,
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.080]   but it makes suggestions, you can confirm them.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.120]   It's a really, really cool.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.000]   And it's also an excellent way to see how bad
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.760]   and how good your hair has been over the years.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.200]   Because you get to see lots of different hairstyles
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.880]   all grouped together in a grid.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.520]   So Picasa, case of recognition, and this is really a cloud tip,
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.000]   but it kind of is because Picasa hooks into Picasa web albums,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.040]   which is Picasa's online hosted albums.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.360]   Now, I confess I prefer Flickr over Picasa web albums,
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.320]   but Picasa web albums also has facial recognition.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.960]   There are some limits on how much you can upload
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.680]   to Picasa web albums for free,
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.000]   but you can also do facial recognition there
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.120]   and tag faces with people from your contacts.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.400]   So it's a really cool feature.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.240]   And I encourage you, or Picasa user,
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:27.680]   to turn it on because you'll on earth pictures of people
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.520]   over time, it's really neat to see people change over time
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.720]   and try out different hairstyles.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.000]   So that's my tip of the week.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.240]   - That's beautiful.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.480]   And we want to see your makeup styles
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.720]   over the period of twig.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.280]   (laughing)
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.680]   And your bike movements and find me in that.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.440]   Wasn't there also an announcement this week
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.760]   that Google was creating kind of an internal cloud
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.160]   that lets you integrate Picasa and Docs and other things?
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.680]   I only have that in the back of my brain.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.000]   Matt, Gina, do you know about more about that?
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.280]   - Yeah, there was a post on, I think Google operating system
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.560]   and then a follow up blog post
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.160]   that sort of hints at the ability to upload
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.200]   and share lots of different data and different data types.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.440]   And if you look at, for example, sites.google.com,
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.360]   they've really added the ability to add more and more things
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.560]   to that page, Picasa albums and stuff like that.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.800]   So I think Google operating system spotted it first.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.480]   And so we went ahead and blogged about it.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.280]   But there's just more ability to sort of upload stuff
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.920]   and store it.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.040]   So I think that's the trend.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.240]   - On Google sites, Matt, right?
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.880]   - It's kind of a cloud.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.840]   - I think that one is Google sites, yes.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.040]   - Google sites, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:40.880]   Cool.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.640]   - All right, so I'm gonna give you advanced warning Liz.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.120]   We're gonna go for the wish list in a minute.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.480]   So think of something you want,
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.720]   but first we'll do the number of the week.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.440]   And my number of the week is 1 billion squared.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.440]   We had Google say this week that YouTube far surpasses
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.320]   the serving that various measurement services had guessed
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.360]   and says that they're serving 1 billion videos a day.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.280]   It's like 1 billion McDonald's hamburgers every day,
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.720]   which is incredible.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.400]   We also have Eric Schmidt in a deposition saying
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.600]   that he knows, yes, he overpaid for YouTube
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.080]   by about a billion dollars, same number.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.280]   But said it was worth it necessary
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.720]   so that he could grab it away from the competitors.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.680]   And I think that's coming true.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.320]   So there's my number of the week.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.880]   Now on to wish list.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.200]   Matt, you want to lead us off here?
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.280]   What's something you wish for in our cloudy world?
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.200]   - Absolutely.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.800]   I wish that we would crawl Ajax.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.160]   And in fact, we've been taking some steps toward that.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.320]   So at the SMX conference in New York
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.560]   that Danny Sullivan puts on,
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.240]   which is a great search conference,
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.040]   we proposed a method to crawl Ajax.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.960]   And it's not as if we'll crawl your Gmail without permission.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.680]   You have to make a few changes to your Ajax URLs
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.440]   instead of just having a hash mark.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.640]   And then state after that,
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.640]   you'd have to have a hash mark and then an exclamation point.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.160]   So it's not as if Google's going to index your Ajax
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.440]   without your permission,
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.400]   but in the same way that people want to be able to do flash,
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.120]   they want to be able to do rich media,
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.240]   and they want search engines to keep up.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.360]   I think it would be fantastic if search engines
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.680]   would be able to crawl Ajax.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.960]   And my wish is that the proposal is well received.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.320]   We get good feedback and then in a few weeks or a month
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.320]   or whenever we can sort of nail that down a little bit more
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.600]   and start pushing the web forward a little bit.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.320]   - Now, how would that work?
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.080]   Would the Google bot actually parse the JavaScript
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.480]   and see where the Ajax calls,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.960]   where the dynamic calls for data were coming from?
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.000]   - Well, and that would be the science fiction in the limit.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.280]   And Google bot can parse some JavaScript,
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.160]   but not to the degree that we'd be able to do that quite yet.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.600]   So the proposal is basically that you have,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.280]   they call it a headless browser,
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.000]   which means when someone comes to one of these special URLs,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.720]   and it doesn't matter whether it's Google bot
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.520]   or whether it's a whether user,
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.840]   essentially the web server will render the,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.040]   run the JavaScript,
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.680]   figure out what the final HTML will be,
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.720]   and then take that HTML snapshot and return that.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.600]   And that's what the Google bot or users can sort of see
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.280]   in index, but then Google bot can sort of send you
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.400]   to the Ajax URL directly with any luck.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.600]   - Ooh, fancy.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.520]   - I love that.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.340]   I think it gets us into the whole new kind of
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.600]   he passed the page web, right?
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.400]   The idea that Marissa's been talking about,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.480]   we've talked about a lot in the show
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.160]   of the hyper personal news stream, Twitter search.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.040]   It gets you into a whole new dimension of search
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.640]   that's kind of raw and surreal in this, right?
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.480]   - Yeah, yeah, and if you want, I can throw a quick tip in.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.320]   - Please.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.480]   - Yeah, I was ready.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.640]   I could throw out a number or a tip or a wish.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.480]   So.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.000]   - I throw a wall out, man.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.840]   (laughs)
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.400]   - Well, okay.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.200]   Quick tip, you might not have noticed this,
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.920]   but if you go to Google and you do a search,
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.120]   for example, for a product,
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.720]   if you do a search like Kindle,
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.120]   there's a little line that appears
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.400]   above the search results called options or show options.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.760]   We sort of call it the tool belt.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.920]   And if you click that,
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.400]   one of the new options is fewer shopping sites.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.320]   So one of the common complaints we get
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.240]   is people do not want to get, yeah, show options.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.880]   And then way down in there is fewer shopping results.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.520]   So you can choose more shopping results
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.200]   if you wanna do some comparison shopping,
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.600]   or if you want reviews of your Kindle or iPod or LCD TV
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.280]   or whatever it is,
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.280]   you're more likely to get in gadget and people talking
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.800]   about it rather than people trying to sell it to you.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.280]   So that's a very common request.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.200]   And I'm glad that we can sort of provide that functionality.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.560]   I think that's a pretty fun tip.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.400]   - Yeah, number two.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.200]   - Yeah, number, absolutely.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.280]   One million, which is the number of views
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.240]   we're about to hit on our Webmaster video channel.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.080]   So we've made about 150 little two minute short videos
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.040]   that answer common people's questions.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.240]   If you do a Google search for Webmaster video channel,
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.960]   it's the first result from YouTube.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.240]   And when we hit exactly one million,
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.720]   which will happen in the next week or so,
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.400]   we're going to post a fun video.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.800]   I think people will enjoy it.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:10.840]   - Wonderful.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.280]   By the way, I wanna note that the chat room
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.480]   is debating now what a billion squared is.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.280]   I'm delighted to see that.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.200]   Liz, I've already given my wish,
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.120]   which is Liz, I want you to learn wave
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.120]   and work hard with news.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.120]   That's my wish.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:24.960]   What's your wish?
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:31.600]   - My wish is I wish that Google Doc supported Mailmerge
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.240]   because it's the one thing that keeps me
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.920]   from moving a lot of my workflow into Google Docs
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:41.200]   is that I am deeply dependent on being able to merge
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.640]   spreadsheet, word processing, and email together.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.840]   And without those, that capability,
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.840]   without particularly without the Mailmerge capability,
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.120]   I can't use Google Docs for anything serious.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.200]   And so I really hope that that's coming.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.560]   - Gina, wish.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.400]   - That's a good one.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.920]   So my wish, and this is kind of cool
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.480]   'cause I can hassle not about it a little bit.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.400]   Although I know Matt, I don't think this is what you do
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.480]   specifically, but.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.520]   - My wish has to do with Google Groups.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.720]   I run a few Google Groups for a couple of open source projects
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.720]   and other things.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.600]   And there's a spam problem, and it makes me so sad
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.840]   because Gmail is so good at spam and dealing with spam.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.120]   And there just aren't controls for Google Groups
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.560]   as many controls as I'd like.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.520]   So I've had to make my Google Groups list approval only.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.040]   So I have to approve every message from a new user.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.600]   So if you wanna run an open group,
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.680]   basically I have to green light every single post
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.520]   that goes through.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.440]   So I avoid the Viagra and check out my webcam messages.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.080]   They go out a lot, a lot more than I thought.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.520]   So better spam filtering and more
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.080]   and easier filtering options.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.800]   Like I'd like to just be able to say,
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.760]   any message that contains the word Viagra
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.160]   has excessive links to put that aside
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.640]   or for moderation automatically.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.760]   - That's a very good wish.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.040]   I'm more than happy to pass that on
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.960]   because I think I know some of the people
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.080]   working in that area.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.080]   And I know that they have gotten much better
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.760]   about spam on groups, but it's not completely finished.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.640]   So I can definitely go and sort of check with people
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.080]   and ask what's up and sort of, you know,
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.720]   are there any new things coming down the pipe
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.920]   that might help with that?
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.880]   - Excellent, friends in high places.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.400]   Excellent, thank you.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.440]   - A happy ending to Twig number 11.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.840]   I wanna thank our wonderful panelists,
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.480]   always Gina Trapani of sportawear.org,
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.720]   Liz Lolly from the Rochester Institute of Technology.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.880]   And I'm sorry, Liz, give me your URL for the project again.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.240]   - Kicksuretheimpossible.com.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.880]   - And of course, Matt Cutz,
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.400]   who's kind enough to come in from Google
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.680]   and show off his new do.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.960]   And I also wanna thank the folks in the chat room
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.920]   who are very kind and not making fun of the fact
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.480]   that I'm Leo Light.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.120]   So Leo, come back, we need you.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.400]   Thank you very much.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.480]   And that's another twin.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.300]   (apletic guitar music)
