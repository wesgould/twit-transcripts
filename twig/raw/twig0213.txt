[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.500]   [Music]
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.400]   This is Twig. This Week in Google, episode 213, recorded August 28, 2013.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.500]   Jive in with Jargus.

[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   It's time for this week in Google to show the covers Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, anything that we really want to talk about, basically.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.500]   It's when you have a panel like this, you don't hold them back. You talk about Chipotle and Glee, too.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:29.000]   Gina Trapani is here from smartawear.org, founding editor at Life Hacker. She's the author of Think Up, which is a great Twitter analytics program.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And to do text, a great to do text program. Hi, text base.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hello. Hello, Gina. Hello. Good to see you. A new update to do text this week.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Oh, good.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And I was actually just looking at the developer console and I have zero crashes and zero ANRs and ANRs and application not responding in the three days that it's been out, which is like, "Ahh!"
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That's cool. So there's this instrumentation that you're automatically notified if a program crashes or has a problem.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yeah, I see the version of Android, the version of the app, and the device that it's running on.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So I can test and reproduce, which is really nice.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   That's really cool.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Oh, thanks.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Jeff Jarvis is also here, Buzzmachine.com. He is the author of Public Parts. He's in his office at the City University of New York, where he labors to teach the tenets of journalism to a bunch of callow youths.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And greed.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And greed.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And it's an exhausting job.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Also here from Gig Oum, one of its most senior editors, great guy to Matthew Ingram at his lake cabin.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   So jealous.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Hey, Matthew.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Hi, everybody.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Good to have you back.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Is everybody running out and buying a new Nexus 4?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   No, I'm not going to know what's going on.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Huh?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Jealous that Matthew has obviously has a good bend with it as cabin.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Are you on 4G or something, Matthew? Or do you actually have internet there?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   This is internet. It's a high-speed microwave from a tower across the lake.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That's so you can go there anytime you want and work.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Considering that you have the choice between taking a rope swing and like jumping into the lake and sitting on skype here with us, I'm really honored that you joined us.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You should be very grateful.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We'll make this painless and quick.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So I interrupted you, Leo.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Sorry.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Well, I'm just saying, I noticed there you go. There's your Nexus 4.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I was on a month ago.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So cheap.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   About one a month ago.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I did too, Matthew. Isn't that funny?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I finally broke down and bought one and now they've dropped the price.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Me too.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's 200 bucks for the 8 gig of right, which you know, I don't think you know what?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You still got deals.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah, it's still cheap.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That's true.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   That's true.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And it'll be what?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I went back and forth between the S4 and the Nexus and finally went for the Nexus.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I think you made the right choice. The S4, I've kind of give it up on just there's so much Samsung stuff on it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah, that's what I didn't want.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And I like the updates.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, 4.3. You're already at 4.3.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I like it. In fact, so much that I decided not to put my launcher.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Normally I put nova launcher on all my Android devices, but just to do really pure Google.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Really?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah, they've come a long way, baby.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Yeah, really.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Really.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Really being very useful.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I bought my Moto X.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Oh, you and you in the Moto X.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Now what now what?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Now what do you hate?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   No, no, I, well, I would open it.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I need your advice.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I went into the store and look at it to say if I fall in love with it, I'll open it.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   If I don't, I'll send it back.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Right.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I'll wait for the Nexus 5 or whatever.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Or I'll get the Moto X eventually.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   But that way you have to get a black or a white one, right?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I had a 16 gig, another a third gig.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.640]   But here's the thing.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   The screen to me and my old failing eyes looks weird.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.240]   The text has a blue cast around it, like a blue drop shadow.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.520]   Have you not used an AMOLED screen before?
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   Is that the issue?
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   Well, I don't know.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.160]   I saw your post on Google+, and I looked, I immediately went to my Moto X, which has
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   since been returned.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160]   I had a loner.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.720]   I need to see any shadow and a lot of commenters on your post say, what are you talking about?
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   So maybe there's a default.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.760]   Yeah, but then there was a lot of what kind of screen it was.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.680]   Somebody said it could be my glasses, which I think is the case.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.960]   I went to the store today just before the show and looked again until my glasses off
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   and looked.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   I didn't see it so much.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.600]   Then I compared in the AT&T store my Nexus 4 and the HTC One and the Moto X one after
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   the other.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.960]   The Moto X is just many times brighter white.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.840]   Yeah, it's of the three that you just mentioned, the only AMOLED screen.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.920]   And so I guess that has maybe it has some impact on my correction or something like that.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.760]   But there's this weird blue haze around the letters.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.320]   I would look at a set, but you've looked at several different ones, right?
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.480]   I mean, it's all of them do the same thing.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.640]   And somebody said, well, it's been burned in.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.200]   Well, it's been there for one day.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.320]   I would say don't get that then.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   I'm going to say.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.320]   I don't see it.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.640]   And then apparently it's not common.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.480]   But if you see it, you shouldn't get it.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.960]   The Galaxy Nexus, I didn't like very much because I thought it was a substandard screen.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.880]   I've kind of come around on that.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.320]   I mean, the Nexus 4?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   I mean, what did I say?
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.520]   Yeah, the Nexus 4.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.160]   The best screen out there is still probably the HTC One.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.040]   But there more, the difference in brightness of the white was amazing.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.600]   Well, but it might be more natural.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.880]   What AMOLED does so well is contrast ratio.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.600]   Blacks are blacker than any other kind of screen in whites are whiter.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.200]   The contrast ratio is amazing on AMOLED.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.120]   Do I dare ask this?
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.580]   What does AMOLED mean?
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.600]   Organic light emitting diode OLED is different from LCD.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.800]   So most of these other screens are LCD screens, which means they have a shutter, which lets
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   light through.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.640]   They're backlit and the light comes through and the shutter opens and closes and it does
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.800]   colors that way.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   OLED screens are actually direct view.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.680]   They're emitting the light.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.360]   Each cell, each pixel has its own, is emitting its own light.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.880]   There's no backlight.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.960]   And so they tend to be brighter.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.160]   They're also more efficient.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.760]   And then one of the things Motorola is taking advantage of is the fact that you could turn
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.200]   on individual pixels without turning on the backlight as you do it.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.120]   Now, I suppose you know such neat stuff, you know that?
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.880]   Well, then that's why you have that hovering, you know, the pulsing wake up, you know, while
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   it's sleeping.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.200]   Oh, you know, because they don't have to turn on the whole screen.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.560]   And so it uses, it's sips it to juice.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.760]   The other thing that you should know about OLED screens is when they're black, they don't
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.120]   use any power.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.320]   So you always want to use a black theme for best battery life.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.920]   I'm so glad you asked, Jeff, because honestly, I did not know this.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.440]   I appreciate the explanation.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.080]   I thought everyone knew that.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.040]   I, you know, as well as things where hardware just never...
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.040]   Not interesting.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.440]   Yeah, not as interesting, but when you explain it, Leo, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.760]   Yeah, back in the day, many years ago, my child was sitting in a twit and they would
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.560]   get going in some kind of thing about a TV, something, you know, going on with video
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.120]   drivers, that kind of stuff.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.760]   You're talking about tech TV?
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   Video drivers.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   It's one of the reasons it's interesting.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.760]   You asked that as I just got the first OLED television set.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   LG.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.360]   It's coming tomorrow.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.120]   LG and Samsung are selling for the first time OLED based screens.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.040]   You know, all our screens now have been plasma or LCD.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.360]   You need to invite six people to your unboxing.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.160]   I have a lot of people coming over.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.240]   Robert Herron from Revision3 says, "Can I review?"
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.560]   And I said, "Yes, Scott Wilkins is flying up to calibrate it."
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.560]   Wow.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.360]   A lot of geeks are into this.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.960]   How much are they?
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.360]   9,000, which is...
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   The way they got me, that's the TV right there.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.960]   The way they got me is that the LG is 15,000.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.160]   So I thought, "Oh, this is a great deal."
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.760]   It's curved.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.960]   It's curved for no apparent reason, yeah.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   Wow.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   Because they can.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   Because they can.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   So it's more energy efficient.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   And the blacks are better.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.760]   Blacks, well, and Consumer Reports has already reviewed this particular thing.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.480]   And they said, "It's the best HD TV we've ever reviewed with the best contrast radio,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.960]   the best ratio, the best blacks, the best whites and all.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   We're nine grand.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   I mean, you know.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.240]   What people complain about OLED, and of course, Samsung uses its super AMOLED screens on the
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.960]   Galaxy S4, is that it's inaccurate.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.600]   So for instance, the HTC One is more accurate.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.680]   That's why the white isn't quite as bright, or the colors are maybe a little more accurate.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.160]   But I don't think accuracy and ice cream this size is all that important.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   No.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.320]   So the fact that it's bright and easy to read to me is more important and better on battery
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.480]   life.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.960]   Just makes it better.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.840]   So you thought I was just going to complain about the most?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   I did.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840]   You're we've had a nice lesson.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.840]   I did.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   I thought you were going to line some more.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.080]   It's such a teaching moment.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   So did you get it?
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.960]   So you're still undecided.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.760]   It's still sealed at home.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   Which is very hard for me.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.080]   Jeff, you're so slow to make these decisions.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.480]   I appreciate how much thought you put into them.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.800]   But you know, look, every single purchase like this is a trade-offs, right?
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.360]   Like you're never going to get the perfect, you know.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.760]   I keep saying that there's not I've yet to see the perfect smartphone.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.160]   No, well, if we arrived there, then it's Apple thought we had it, but we didn't.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.880]   Actually, our mobile guy, Kevin Toffel, was going to get an HTC One because he was seduced
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.640]   by the hardware and so on.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.960]   And he actually either sold it or and he's getting the Moto X.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   Kevin really likes the Moto X.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.360]   So it's an ultimate Android phone as far as he's concerned.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.440]   I would say that's pretty close to true is almost a pure Android experience.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.680]   The places where it's not are the advantages of the camera, twist the wrist camera and
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.480]   the, you know, wake up thing and stuff like that.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.120]   And every other respect is very pure Google experience.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   Right.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.760]   It's like progressive enhancement based on sort of specialized hardware, right?
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   Right.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.360]   And I do like the, I do, you know, I like how it feels in the hand, which is hard to describe.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.200]   You know, you can't describe it, you have to just go try it.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.160]   It really feels, of all the phones, the best for some reason, there's something about it.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   It's a little smaller.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.680]   I was concerned maybe I've gotten so used to a big screen.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.480]   Well, in 720p too, which is a disadvantage.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   It's not that small a screen, but it goes almost edge to edge.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.080]   So it, the overall devices.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.800]   Very like really running.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.440]   Excellent battery life, which I think, I think watch carefully what Apple does in a
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.040]   couple of weeks, because I suspect that's going to be one of this chief new features
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.960]   that people aren't really talking about on the new iPhone.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   Is battery life.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   Battery life?
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.120]   So the rationale of the Nexus for $400 less, if this were Apple reducing price, they're
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.040]   getting rid of stock and it means, oh, it was coming.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.440]   But that's not the way it seems here.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.400]   They did it all around the world.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.920]   I think there's a, I think you could pretty much say this is an Nexus 5 just around the
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   corner.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   Yeah, there's an Nexus 5 around the corner.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   I think you could pretty much say that.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   I'm not going to be about it.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.960]   There haven't been any leaks, have there?
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.160]   No, not that I'm aware of.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   I missed it.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.880]   Triple and missed all about Android last night.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.960]   So I'm behind in my Android news, but I know I don't think so.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   Gina is one of the hosts of all about Android.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.280]   That's where we look to her for that information.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.400]   You know, Kevin just rode on giga home.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   I got a lot.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.280]   I got Kawasaki.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.560]   Every time I say anything about the Moto X, for some reason, I think that's changing now,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.720]   but people for a while thought I knew something, which I didn't.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.200]   But every time I said something, it would get quoted a lot.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.280]   Guy Kawasaki sent me off.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.120]   Why did you say it was only $350 to make?
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   And I said, I didn't.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.960]   That was a Goldman Sachs said that.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960]   And I was quoting them.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.640]   Well, now, according to Kevin Toful and IHS, IHS does this kind of assessment of what their
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.840]   opponents are, tear down and, and, and I guess at what it must cost, IHS says, no, I ain't
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   going to $250.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.640]   It's $221.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.560]   Or $226 depends on the, yeah, that's a good price.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.440]   And it's one of the reasons I think maybe I'm surprised that Google doesn't offer this
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.640]   as the Nexus 5 or something like it.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.640]   Lived undercut.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.280]   No, they can't, can they?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   You're right.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.360]   And actually, if you think that seems awfully low, that's actually right in the according
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.720]   to IHS, the iPhone is 207 bucks, a little less the Galaxy S4 for 237 bucks, a little
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   bit more.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.680]   So it's right in the right in there in that range.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.840]   So they develop a version.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.840]   No.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   Go ahead, Gina.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.400]   I was going to ask when the developer version of the Moto X.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.400]   Any minute, right?
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   And soon, right?
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.200]   And there will be a Google Play edition.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   No, there will not.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   There will not.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   Okay.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.800]   There's, it doesn't make sense for them to do it.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   There's just the itself unlocked.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   Right.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.160]   Because the extra features take advantage of the hardware.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.280]   It's so pure as it is.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.800]   You would, by buying a Google edition, you'd just be stripping useful stuff out without
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   any gain.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   But they will have developer editions.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   And all that means is an unlocked bootloader.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.720]   Unlocked bootloader, yeah.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.800]   And the words developer edition on the back.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.760]   Oh, it just got to cool.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.880]   I'm going to get one for one of my developers and I want to get the developer edition, but
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.160]   I want some colden out on it.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.560]   It will be also a 32 gigabyte.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.920]   And we're starting to see the off contract prices now, right?
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.280]   $629, I think it was something like that.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.320]   $674 with tax and delivery.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   Ooh.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   But again, this is kind of normal.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.160]   And I guess the only reason that you might say, well, it should be less is it's 720p screen.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.560]   It's not the super high res screen.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.400]   I don't know if that makes a difference.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.560]   Well, is it the, here's, here's the, but here is it a bit of price fixating just to be
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.040]   provocative in that because of their conflict of interest and channel conflict, they don't
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.480]   want to undercut HTC and Samsung at all to.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   Right.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.480]   Right.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   Right.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   They have to pay attention to that.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480]   They want to keep these other guys happy, I think.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   Definitely.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.440]   And then the issue is, of course, of the Android version, I think you're going to get
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.400]   Moto X to 43 very quickly.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.000]   I don't think that's a real problem.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.600]   Although, you know, the HTC developer, just in the HTC one is now at 43, right?
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.080]   Or four, isn't it?
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.480]   Yeah, the Google play just the Google play just did get the update.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   Yep.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.480]   Yep.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   Which was nice.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.480]   The HTC said we're going to do it fast and they did.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   And they did.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.320]   So anyway, I'm sorry that we got into an Android discussion.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.800]   We should defer that to all about Andrea, but it is kind of a big part of Google's business.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   Oh, it is.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   Definitely.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.600]   That's just a little tiny part.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   But interesting.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   Interesting.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   Oh, we're getting a little echo from you now.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   I don't know what that's, who's that coming from?
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   Chad.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   Is that me?
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.040]   Haven't isolated yet.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   We're okay.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.200]   We're working to isolate that.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.280]   As soon as we've triangulated it.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.840]   There's three guests listening to a team out to handle it.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.760]   Here's a product I like, the Robo car.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.160]   Apparently, according to the Ojessica Lessons blog, Amir Afrati writing, Google has started
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.080]   to talk to people who build cars.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   Their contract manufacturers, not the big names you know, but people who build cars
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.840]   for other people about building self-driving cars.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.000]   No one's talking, but they've been talking to Cotton N.L.A.G. and Magna International
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.600]   to manufacture a Nexus car.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.240]   I hope they call it Nexus.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.000]   One, one, one, one.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.920]   I put the Nexus on, but I think that if it's, if it's, Google should name everything that's
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.880]   a Google edition should be a Nexus, right?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.880]   Yes.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.880]   Nexus.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.720]   And it only comes in primary color.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:56.480]   I hope it's like that Tesla that was a Larry or Sergio was driving.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480]   The Batmobile.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.560]   Yeah, the Batmobile and had the Chrome logo on there.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.440]   But what's interesting, it would be self-driving.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.600]   The other report, rumor, is that they would actually build instead a fleet of self-driving
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   taxis.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   Right.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.200]   They could do both.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   Yes.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   That's the idea of self-driving taxis.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.000]   And apparently Uber is interested in acquiring these.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   That's the investment.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Right.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   The Mongo investment.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.840]   And the robot would have to take you to Brooklyn.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.840]   You know, for as little as that.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.160]   All cars lead to Brooklyn.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   According to this article, at first, RoboTaxis would require the human in the car to sit behind
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.000]   the wheel in case of emergency.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So they would just talk.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Right.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   To you.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.960]   Or I don't know if this is legal or what, but I hope they do this.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.080]   That would be very cool.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.480]   Well, meanwhile, the war is coming up.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.160]   The next story in the rundown is that Nissan is saying not so fast Google, we are going
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.000]   to build self-driving cars too.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Really?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.240]   But really, I mean, is that, you know, I mean, I assume they are, but their target seems
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   incredibly ambitious.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.880]   I mean, you can't just whip up a self-driving car.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.800]   I think it's not whipping it up, Matthew, because I think all of the manufacturers have
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   been looking at this for some time.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   Yeah, I guess they probably.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.880]   GM had a concept car two years ago at CES that was an urban transport, autonomous urban
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.600]   transport vehicle.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   I wrote around it.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.240]   It was very cool.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.880]   It only had seats for two.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.560]   And I said, well, what if, you know, if you have a family, they said, well, it's autonomous.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.720]   You just get a few more and you daisy chain and they just drive, they go wherever you're
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   going.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.320]   That's like, oh, that's, that's, that's, that's the further rendition of we can look at
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.960]   up real quick, Chad, the Homer.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.800]   The Homer is the ugliest car I ever saw.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.640]   Somebody's making the Homer, right?
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.400]   No, Homer Simpson's car.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   Yes.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.360]   Well, I don't know how serious they are.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360]   There were two bubbles.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.880]   And so the kids were the other bubbles.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.880]   You didn't hear them.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.840]   They have leg irons in a shag carpeting and there you go.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   There you go.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   As you could imagine heaven.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   Here's the actual.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:19.800]   Here's the actual Homer car.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.080]   Somebody has built it and I think they're going to start selling.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   Wow.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   No, well, I don't know.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   They don't see.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   There you go.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.520]   There's a model version.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.720]   Here's the full size.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.840]   Oh, it's just a modified something.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.520]   I like the Bentley grill or whatever the Rolls Royce grill.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.840]   Maybe it's a Rolls Royce.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.600]   You won't catch me driving that thing, Ron.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.920]   There's the Homer ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.720]   The horn.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.280]   There are three horns because Homer says you can never find a horn when you're mad.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.000]   And they all play, of course.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.040]   La cucaracha, la cucaracha.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:11.080]   Gigantic cup holders.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.840]   Powerful like a gorilla yet soft and yielding like a Nerf ball designed for the average
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.000]   man.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.440]   The team at, believe it or not, there is a company called Pork You Beamer Motors has
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440]   built one.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.440]   It's a race car.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:31.080]   They're going to race it at the 24 hour of lomons, not lomans, lomons, which is a button
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.440]   in button will, button will, California, not France.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.360]   Button will button will.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.680]   I don't know where that is and I live in California.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   24.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.000]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.120]   I wasn't pronouncing it right.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.960]   Lemons, L E M O and S the 24 hour of lemons.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.280]   Now, now I get it.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.080]   See, this is what's going to happen now with this big Google.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.920]   When they start making cars, we're going to become auto week.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.200]   We be phone back.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.120]   We're everything.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   Who's the star?
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.800]   Not enough cup holders, more cup holders.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.120]   Actually, ahead of GM who said no matter what they do to their cars or Ford, no matter
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.320]   what features they add, the number one criticism is not enough cup holders.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.960]   You cannot have enough cup holders.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.880]   That is the silliest thing ever, right?
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.120]   So my new car, which comes in two weeks, three weeks, something like that, has Google
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.400]   Earth as its map.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   Get out of here.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.000]   Does Google Maps have a ship with most cars at this point?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   No.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   The cars now system.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.100]   So I was thinking about like Google building self driving cars versus Nissan building,
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.560]   self driving cars.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.240]   This is where Google's like brand trust like plays such a big role, right?
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.760]   Because Google has been navigating me around whether I'm on foot or my bike or my car
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.520]   for a long time now.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.160]   So I trust Google to get me where I need to go because they've been doing it, right?
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   Because maps is everywhere.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   So I don't have to more likely to choose the Google car.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   That's a good point.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.200]   I think that's a really important point in the trust.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   It's not just directions.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.280]   It's also trust, really in technology.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.800]   At some point you understand how a car, car works and the brakes work or whatever.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   Okay, it's physical.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.200]   But to get to the smarts that are necessary to make a safe self-driving car, who are you
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   going to trust?
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   Right.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   Google's the moonshot company.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   Yep.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   You don't want to Apple Maps in your Jeep.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   No.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.120]   Although I should say there's a couple of companies who have shown that because they're putting
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.720]   Siri in like a lot of companies are putting Siri in their car.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.720]   And who was it?
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.440]   We saw Apple Maps in what it was a Chevy.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.600]   It was one of the car companies.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   Has Apple Maps.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.760]   So it's Google Earth that's coming with your new car, not apps.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   It has Google Earth.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.240]   Yeah, I wonder why there's a distinction between the super cars.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   It's an Audi.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.040]   Do you have an Audi coming?
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   An Audi coming.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.520]   Oh, which one?
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.680]   I ordered it in May.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   Whoa.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   Geez.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   Is it custom-port?
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.280]   Well, apparently they're all custom.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   We would build this for you when you give us $5,000.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.600]   Then we'll talk.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.000]   That's for the doors.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.040]   They have to drive it across the Atlantic.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   It takes a while.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.080]   Are you going to be on vacation when your car shows up?
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   You're so sad.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.760]   You should have gone and done the pick it up in Germany.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   I should have.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.760]   I really wanted to.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   I almost did, actually.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.960]   But then I thought, oh, I have a job.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.280]   So that kind of ruined that.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.760]   Plus, I still can't figure out how you get across the ocean.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.480]   They build that into the price.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   They do.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480]   We did that when I was a kid.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.160]   We went to-- was it Darmstadt in Germany to get our Volkswagen?
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   Wolfsburg.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   Wolfsburg.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   Wolfsburg.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   That's right.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   Went to Wolfsburg, got the Volkswagen.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160]   And then you have to arrange transport.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.120]   And we came back on the Queen Mary with the car in the hold.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   Really?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   Wow.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.960]   So, because we were taking a car with us and passengers.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.480]   I guess it's $50 for the extra bag.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.520]   I don't know.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.520]   This is 1967.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520]   Everything's changed.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.320]   I have this vision of a different lifestyle for Leo that you had your nanny and your maids
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   with you.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   We did.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   We did.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   This is great.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   I had my steamer trunks brought on by the boy.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.160]   He has a little red hat.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.000]   No, it was much more like the Marx Brothers jammed in the cabinet.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.400]   My dad was a professor, Jeff.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.760]   You know what that means.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.520]   Hey, speaking of which, did you get your Nexus 7 LTE version yet?
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   No!
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520]   No!
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.120]   I want it.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.680]   It's for sale every day, every day, every day I search for Nexus 7 LTE.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   Head should probably win.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   Get it?
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   No.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.800]   And now, here's the latest in dignity.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.960]   It's for sale in Germany, the UK.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   France!
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.560]   I'm telling you, France gets it first.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.960]   What the hell's wrong here?
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   How dare they?
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   They have Frenchies.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   That's fine.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.440]   Jeff, you have friends in Germany though.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   Just get them an essential.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.240]   No, because it's a different frequency.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   You don't want the US.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   Oh, right.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.240]   You want the US version.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   Good point.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.120]   Nice job, though.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.680]   We don't get stuff all the time in Canada.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   I'm pretty used to it.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   Right, you are.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   You are.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   There's no point in getting a Canadian Ryle.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   See that's the nice Canadian thing.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   Screw us and we'll apologize for it.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.680]   Sure.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   Send it to us.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   We're not like that down here in Grum.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   Do you want my Nexus 7 LTE?
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.120]   You really have to adopt the American sense of entitlement if we're going to be on the
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.120]   wig.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.120]   That's right.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.120]   Get with it.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.680]   Where's my Chromecast?
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.440]   I had this vision today that somebody with a sense of humor at Google would put it on
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.840]   for sale right now during the show and I'd have to order it during the show.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.840]   I'll order it for you.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.200]   I've gotten very good at talking and ordering crap at the same time.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   It's amazing.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:03.880]   I can get stuff like that.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.920]   I put my credit card in all pre-filled and everything.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.120]   I just push a button and it goes, "Bruh."
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.520]   That's what you got for Chromecast with four.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520]   I have to.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   Five.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.040]   Did you get five and you got five Netflix codes as well, right?
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.760]   You got them early enough?
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.280]   I did, but now they say you can't use them all at once, but I think I'm believing that
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.400]   I can apply the next one in three months and the next one in three months after that.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.400]   They have not.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.760]   Nothing's been added to Chromecast and in fact something was just taken away.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.680]   Well, but don't get your knickers and nuts.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   Good.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   Everybody want crazy.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   Everybody want crazy.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   What's the name of the app that was first about all cast?
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   It was Aircast.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680]   It was Aircast.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.040]   He changed it to all cast because of trademark reasons.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.920]   I think it's coach I learned.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   It's not coach.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.680]   I was pronouncing it coach.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   It's coach.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   Good to know.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.120]   It suddenly wouldn't work.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.120]   There's stories all over about how Google's cutting us out.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.280]   Google has a grand conspiracy.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.680]   Google has a Google has a Google has a Google has a Google has a Google has a Google has
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   that well.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   It turns out it's just that it's made of folks and they made a change and it's not.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   They changed it.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.680]   They didn't do it on purpose.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:18.280]   Coach kind of fan the flames by saying that they had he felt that they had intentionally
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.560]   changed a particular parameter that he was using.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.160]   He wasn't using SDK by the way.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.080]   He reversed engineering the protocol.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.600]   So he was going around.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.760]   So they changed a little bit of the protocol and he said they did it intentionally and
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.520]   yeah, turn it into and turn it to a whole thing.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   It's on the rundown.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:39.320]   And below that story, Leo, a Google put out a statement saying, yeah, never mind.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   Sorry.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.400]   Although isn't it using dial?
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:49.920]   Isn't it using this open source protocol called dial, which was why coach could probably,
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.680]   you know, reverse it?
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.780]   You know, it seems to be from what I looked at that everything Chromecast is doing is
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.440]   based on various open source technologies.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   That would surprise me.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.920]   So the Google cast protocol, right?
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:12.960]   Maybe that's based on dial is a similar, very similar open source, open standard.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.840]   But I have a problem with Chromecast.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   It's strange that they're being so conservative and shutting down apps this early on or like
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.480]   not enabling streaming and video directly from your device, their Chromecast.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.320]   I mean, what coach did was very basic.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.000]   I don't know why they would have.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.800]   Well, you're still believe you said they were just screwing around with the SDK and changing
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   things.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.040]   They didn't, they're saying they didn't deliberately shut this down.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.720]   They made it change and that change had an impact on something that they didn't have
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   any role.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   This happens all the time.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.520]   So he probably, he probably had hooks into it somehow.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.680]   And they changed the part that he was looking into.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.160]   You know, you're a developer, Gina.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   This happens all the time.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.520]   If you develop with the non state with a non public API, yeah, it's not cool.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.160]   All of that changes underneath you.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.680]   But, but the, but the, it really is, it's a bad.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.240]   I'm waiting for Matthew's post for this.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.320]   Matthew be right in this probably while he's on the show.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.560]   You could order things Leo.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.480]   He'll write a 40 inch post of his while we're on the show.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   I guarantee you.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.240]   Because it's a journalistic issue here that he'll, he'll piggy on.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   That is.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   Yes.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   Right, Matthew?
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.800]   That is that the world, I went through looking for the rundown and I went through the, by
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.160]   Google search, there were stories everywhere about Google shuts down, Google shuts down,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.160]   Google shuts down.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   Right.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.800]   And the way to do reporting is this is the problem with our current tech press is nobody
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.560]   sat back and looked at something and called and said, what's going on here?
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.320]   Well, and when you do, gosh, amazing fascinating.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.480]   Well, I think we're very, first of all, part of that is cynical.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.440]   You got to be in the blog world.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   You got to be first.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.960]   You got to get the headline.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.720]   It's a much better headline to say Google shuts down, coach, coach, cash, then it is
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.640]   to say, oh, cost used to, coach used to the unpublished API and got changed out for my
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640]   name.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   Right.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.800]   And of course he fanned, as you said, Gina, he fanned the flames by, by complaining about
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   it.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   He, he framed the story that way.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.520]   I believe they did this intentionally.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.040]   The biggest problem for me is a lot of the tech press isn't technical.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.680]   And so anybody who's technical, anybody who's, you know, we've seen this over and over again,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.600]   API's unpublished APIs are always risky to use.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.800]   It happens with Microsoft and Apple too.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.120]   If you use an unpublished API, you're running the risk that things will get changed and
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.520]   your stuff will not work.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.520]   Mm hmm.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   Absolutely.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.960]   In fact, even if you use a published API, you run the record.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960]   Yeah, sometimes they can have it.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.440]   You've seen lots of startups rely on Twitter's API or Amazon's API, then they change it.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.440]   There you go.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.560]   But you know, coach is kind of a rock star in the community and people really look up
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.800]   to him and love his stuff and he makes really cool stuff.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   So I think when he says Google intentionally broke my app, that's what gets how old is
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.200]   he next time it's the boy, my kid, right?
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.000]   I mean, how old is he?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   He's 11.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.360]   He probably, he probably doesn't know that, you know, hey, knock it off.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.360]   Cool.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.360]   It's fun for him.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.640]   He's a one guy, one man army of, he's amazing.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.200]   He is amazing.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.040]   But I think you know, to be, to get serious about the journalism part, Lee, thank you
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.880]   for that it is much more, you're going to get more page views.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.840]   You're going to get more people excited if you say Google did something bad or Apple
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:10.600]   did something bad, then you will kind of calmly explaining that something totally rational
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   happened.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.520]   And that's unfortunately, you know, the incentives are all mismatched, like you're not going to
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.360]   get as meant.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.240]   But you may have to use this too.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.040]   When you actually, the one person who does go to the effort to do the report and to call
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.080]   Google, you know, I don't report much anymore.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.440]   When I do do that, I get more attention to those posts than anything else.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.800]   They actually have substance in them.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.680]   And that's what people do end up passing around.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.400]   But you know, you can't read in the end.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   That's true.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.200]   But you have sort of a hundred of the other one.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.840]   And then, and then there's the one person who writes the kind of debunking post and
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.800]   says, just relax, this is what really happened.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.960]   I do find those have a lot of value, but it's usually like one to a hundred.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.360]   Everybody's aware of, everybody's a little cynical.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:02.520]   Everybody's aware of, you know, a how this is how money is made.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.360]   And, and, but I also think there's a kind of a dearth of technical, you know, information.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.880]   There's certain blogs that you could trust that, you know, when a non-tech says something,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.960]   ours, Technica, when John Syracuse says something, there's certain people that you just know
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.720]   when they say it, that they're coming from a deep technical knowledge of the thing.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.000]   And they're not writing the, the, and they probably don't generate as much traffic.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.920]   Well, speaking of which, we're going to come back and talk about twerking and Miley Cyrus
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.920]   in just a moment.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.920]   Oh, God.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.240]   Well, you know, there's, there's always that tension between explaining something in a
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.040]   way that's like, groggable by people who are interested, but maybe not developers are highly
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   technical.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.640]   You know, that you always, I always felt like a life hacker, I was worried about being
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.600]   too reductionist or too simplistic when explaining things.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.160]   Uh, you know, but you want to explain enough.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.120]   I mean, there's, there's some of that, but, you know, but no, but no, I agree.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.640]   And you guys always did a great job.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.840]   I thought like I am not a super technical person.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.600]   I mean, I know enough to get around, but I always thought life hacker hit that mark really
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.200]   well where you explain enough to make it obvious that, you know, what you're talking about
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.400]   and to give people a grounding.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.160]   If you don't go into mind boggling detail.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   Thank you.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.160]   Thank you.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.760]   I mean, the more technical posts would alienate kind of new readers, right?
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.160]   And like, and our, and our goal was to bring in more readers and, and as the time went
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.640]   on, the sites, you know, was like, we need to appeal more to our mainstream audience and
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.720]   bring more of an audience in, but you can, you alienated technical audience with an oversimplified
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.080]   post and you scare off new, you know, new readers, maybe artists technical with something
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   that's too detailed.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.720]   I mean, it's, it's a tough, it's just a tough line to walk.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   Not that I'm defending.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.320]   Like I'm not, I'm not saying that people should, you know, pick up the phone and call
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.160]   and find out what exactly happened and not take, you know, a well known developers word.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:45.960]   I mean, he was obviously offended and annoyed that his athletes spent time working on broke.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   But you know, in this case, but yeah, no, it's, it's a, he's meeting with them.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.440]   It'll, it'll work again.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.920]   It's in Google's interest to make it work.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.680]   That's, that was why it was a surprising story.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   Just think about it.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   Why would they turn that off?
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   Wow.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.440]   They know, they complain about Chromecast.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.320]   And there's nothing to do with the motor wax.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   Nothing to do with it.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   It's a problem.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.600]   I mean, it does have a lot to do with my pixel.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.200]   So here I am using the God, the blessed pixel, the Google bless machine and suddenly Chromecast
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.880]   stops working in Google Play and Netflix.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:27.160]   It doesn't show the icon, doesn't show Jack in Chrome on my Chrome pixel.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.160]   It still works in YouTube.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.760]   It still works on the top of the screen for casting a tab.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.440]   But I suddenly can't do Netflix or play.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.920]   I put this up online because somebody says, you know, one of the helpful user suggestions
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.760]   is, did you try installing the Chromecast app?
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.280]   Yeah, because I'm telling you it doesn't work.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.680]   I just told you what it works in.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.640]   But somebody else did the same thing with the pixel and said, yep, same problem.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.640]   So Google, hello.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   I'll try it.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.680]   I'll try it at home tonight.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.040]   As you know, I have five Chromecast.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:04.880]   Because you're so good at purchasing things while you're live broadcasting an announcement.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.880]   It's kind of scary.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   It's scary.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.760]   I'm really, really, really purchasing five Chromecast, interacting with the chat room,
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.320]   running the show, doing an ad read.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.320]   I just bought a house five minutes ago.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.920]   I don't think you're in.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.760]   It is the greatest radio I've ever seen.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   It is.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.760]   It's what you learn when you're in radio.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   You're doing 18 things.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.160]   I use the on with Ron Owens on P.G.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.520]   O'Brien's in perfect Francisco all the time.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.920]   Ron is a pros pro and Ron will be sitting there.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   We were friends.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.000]   We were talking to me and he had my his mic on mute.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.400]   He's been on horses during the show.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.640]   I'm thinking, how is he doing this?
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   What's wrong?
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.040]   He just put up his hand and he hit the mic and he'd say, why do you say that?
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   Turn back off.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   You got to come back to me.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   And then he's got his, he's got his pager out and he's going to Miley Cyrus in the fourth.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.240]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.560]   I like that horse.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.120]   It's got a nice rear.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.200]   So let's see.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.520]   Surgeon live streams operation using Google Glass.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.440]   I'm just I'm not going to that doctor.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.880]   I don't want that to happen.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.520]   A surgeon from Ohio State, Wexner Medical Center, Don, the new headset during routine.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.800]   It was routine surgery last week and streamed up and he's I'm not routine.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.320]   My fault.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.000]   Every operation.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.800]   It's critical.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.760]   You're right.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.480]   It was to medical students.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   This happens all the time.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.600]   I'm not a fan of this either when you're in surgery in them or you're in the hot, it's worse
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.400]   when you're in the hospital and 15 med students come in and then they start, they start probing
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.000]   you and saying, now, why do you think Leo's pain is in his left side?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.400]   What do you think that means?
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.400]   Anybody?
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.400]   Anybody?
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.320]   That's what you don't want.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.840]   Now they're doing it with Google Glass.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.640]   He also consulted with a separate colleague through the headset.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.960]   First time a live point of view collaboration has ever occurred during an operation using
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   glass.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.960]   That's an interesting thing.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.200]   You know, well, do you see what I'm seeing?
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   What is that?
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   Gene or is that the liver?
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   I don't...
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.400]   I mean, I don't know if I would want it to be me, but particularly if you're a teaching
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.840]   hospital, I would think that would be fascinating.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.680]   He was performing ACL surgery, which is pretty routine knee surgery.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.720]   Pretty routine, yeah.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.080]   He says he'd glass didn't get in the way to be honest.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   What's we got into the surgery?
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.840]   I often forgot the device was there.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.320]   That makes sense.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.680]   People who have glass, Gina and Jeff, you report that, right?
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.280]   You just get it just blends in.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   No, not me.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   No, you wear glasses.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   No, no, it's always...
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   Don't if you wear glasses.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.600]   Because you're constantly having to readjusted.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.920]   The surgeon does wear glasses, but he decided not to for this operation.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.760]   I don't know.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:51.160]   Apparently, the medical center has a chief innovation officer.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.760]   Dr. Clay Marsh, so, you know, there you go.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.800]   This is some innovation right there.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   That's what happened.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   That's what happened.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:04.040]   The Shreiner's Hospital is using glass to try to get disabled kids on wheelchair to be
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.280]   able to navigate their wheelchair.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   That's not scary.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   That's really great.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.520]   These are the good uses of glass.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.680]   Like for all the way that people make fun of them, for looking crazy and turning all
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.000]   into cyborgs, you know, all of a sudden, to cyborgs and privacy, like, these are the
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.800]   kinds of applications of glass that are really going to matter.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   And there's quite a few of them.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.840]   I mean, Trey Radcliffe's taking people who can't get out of the house on photo walks.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.760]   That's great.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   That's awesome.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.360]   Yeah, that is awesome.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.480]   So yeah, I hear a lot of these applications.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   I think they're really wonderful.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.840]   Meanwhile, I was looking at field trip even.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.760]   Remember when we were first talking about Google Glass and I had been in Italy, you
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.920]   know, I was looking at field trip.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:47.040]   And just the way I could pull up information about the thing you're looking at would just
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.440]   be hugely like I'm not sure I would use it all the time.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.360]   But if you're in a straight place, it would be fascinating.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.200]   I'm going to Venice in a couple of weeks.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.240]   Do you recommend I put field trip on my phone and turn it on?
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.440]   Yes, definitely.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   I turned it off.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   I used to have it.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.640]   It kept annoying me because there's a place down the road where Peggy Sue got married
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   was filmed.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.240]   Oh, yeah, the filming location is pretty noisy.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   Except for the film.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.200]   It's like, OK, I know that.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.280]   I don't really care.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.600]   I walk by that house every single day.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.880]   It'd be nice if you could say ignore, you know.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.680]   But I think for a new city, yeah, it's not intended for that.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.040]   It's intended for your new place.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.600]   So I'll turn it on in Venice.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.600]   I think it'd be pretty cool.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.560]   Maybe you just wear your head earbuds or something, right?
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.720]   Oh, that'd be almost like this.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.560]   I turned it on up here.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   There was nothing.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.720]   Well, now it should be.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.320]   Here is like 50 miles.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:44.520]   This guy named Jeff Jarvis, he has 2.6 million people circle him.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.920]   So he must be a big wig of some kind.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:52.760]   Has been using auto awesome to show off the fact that he was at the US Open, you lucky
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   dog.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.240]   Have fun.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.000]   And so what are you how are you doing this?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   You're pressing.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.160]   You're doing a I'm using my I'm using an excess one.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.680]   I mean, that kind of one and just hold it down and it's put the sequences in.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.000]   But you don't know what's going to do.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.920]   So there were some odd ones that didn't work.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.400]   But that's Tommy Haas yesterday.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   This is really cool.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.560]   It kind of worked well.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.400]   Yeah, it's really neat.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:19.720]   And I made fun of the Guardian for you the idea of using and that's that's his opponent.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   What's his name?
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.160]   There's some really auto interesting auto.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.760]   So this is for people who don't know the auto awesome feature of Google plus photos where
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.920]   if it sees a number of pictures were taken in rapid succession, it'll turn them into
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.800]   an animated GIF, which is pretty cool.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   It's really cool.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.000]   I think a bunch of pictures of the baby and get great stuff.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.360]   I'll think, oh, for these are blurry or whatever.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.440]   But then it'll auto auto auto awesome them and you'll see kind of an interaction that
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.440]   you didn't catch it.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.520]   It does a really nice job.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520]   I like the.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   I like the guardian.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   Go ahead.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.760]   Well, I was going to say I like the I'm sorry.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   You go.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   You go.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.560]   I like the inadvertent auto awesomes, which you get occasionally.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.520]   Andy and Akko had one.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.400]   He was walking by a fire station or something.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.320]   And I guess as a matter of course, let me see if I can find it.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.920]   You heard it as a matter of course.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.480]   He takes a number of images and it's the fire trucks aren't moving.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.040]   But what you see is the reflections of people going by.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.040]   That's cool.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.440]   So there's a lot of these that are very kind of awesome.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.440]   I would never have known it.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.320]   Richard Jingress is a Northern Iceland right now.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.520]   And he has some really nice ones of just streams.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.360]   People love streams on the line.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   I was well.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.680]   I did what we had to show this in the show some weeks ago.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.960]   I did a neon saw flashing neon sign in London.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.000]   Yeah, there that was another one.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Is it G-I-N-G-R-A-S-S?
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Yes.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Pronounced Jingress.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Jingress.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.400]   I was thinking to be consistent about his G's but he's not.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.360]   He should talk to the GIF guy.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.080]   He's the GIF fight embodied in a person.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.800]   One name.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   One name.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.120]   One name and it's all there.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.160]   Moving on.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   Let's see.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.960]   Did you see?
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.000]   Do you, do they want to have Siri?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.400]   Oh, I didn't get a chance.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   This is a great story.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.920]   I didn't get a chance to try it out myself.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.920]   I've heard it.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   No, I've had it actually.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.440]   Jeff Needles, who is an iPhone bigot, used to be our intern here, he's gone now.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.440]   Thank God.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.680]   He kept doing this.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:32.880]   If you say okay glass to Siri, it says a number of different things.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.880]   Stop trying to strap me on your forehead.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.360]   It won't work.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.960]   Just so you know, I don't do anything when you blink at me.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.720]   Glass, I think you've got the wrong assistant.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.480]   Good on Apple for throwing that stuff in.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   I like that.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   That's good.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   Sense of humor.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   Love it.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.040]   Don't say okay glass to Siri.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.480]   She doesn't like it.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.560]   Little snippy about that.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:05.000]   Remember when we talked about Larry Ellison saying, I like Larry Page.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.560]   He's a nice guy.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.880]   But they, and you don't know it's not evil, but they stole Java from us.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.200]   Eric Schmidt on Google Plus had a little, little something to say.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.440]   Here are the facts he says.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.120]   Google didn't just take Oracle's stuff.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.120]   It's not my opinion.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.080]   It's the judgment of a US District Court.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.400]   Court ruled that the copyright could not be used to block others from using the structure,
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   sequence and organization of APIs.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:38.720]   This actually was a very famous case about APIs.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.720]   The ruling petition.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.880]   This is the one where the judge had coded a very simple class, right?
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.880]   Yes.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.760]   What was it, a sword or something?
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   I can't remember.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   Yes, sword or a number.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   Yes.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.960]   The ruling protects a principle.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.800]   Vital, vital and innovation writes Eric Schmidt.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:59.600]   You cannot copyright an idea as you can a method of operation or like a method of operation.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.920]   No one could copyright the idea of adding two numbers together.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.760]   So there you go.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.840]   I think that kind of flattens it.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.920]   Yeah, he's right and Larry's wrong.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   Right.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.920]   But Charlie Rose.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   Again, an example.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.840]   Charlie Rose is a general purpose reporter, but you wouldn't expect him to say, "Well,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:20.600]   remember in 2012, the judge said you cannot copyright an API."
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   Jiveon was Jarvis.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.240]   He just says things.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.000]   Like he just says things and you know, right, you're expected to believe.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Right.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.560]   It's like a politician, basically.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   You got to fact check him.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:37.480]   So this is Jarvis and Lionel Hampton and the King Cole Trio.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   What the hell?
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.840]   Is this some fan of yours?
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840]   Abdul Jabbar X?
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.640]   Somebody sent this to me.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.320]   No, somebody just sent this to me out of nowhere.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.720]   So this is like Farfick Nougat or whatever that other reggae thing.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   Here we go.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   Listen everybody.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.120]   Jiveon is Jarvis.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   Jiveon is Jarvis.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.120]   Jiveon is Jarvis.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   Jiveon is Jarvis.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   Jiveon is Jarvis.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.120]   So Jarvis must be some guy.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   I like that.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.760]   There was some woman who had a show.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.560]   Oh, it's a show.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560]   Show.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   I like it.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.560]   Should make it my ringtone.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   Jiveon is Jarvis.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560]   It's your theme.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   So I like it.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.080]   Oh, it was a tribute to Los Angeles disc jockey Al Jarvis.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.560]   Oh, here is the Zylopone a lot anymore.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.480]   Was that your dad Al Jarvis?
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.480]   No, no, no, no.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.400]   Those are vibes, man.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   The lyrics are zylophones.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   That's vibes.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.640]   It's just like a zylophone.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.840]   What is the difference in vibes in a zylophone?
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.440]   I hope I never know.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   I never heard of a vibe until just the end.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.160]   Like I never want to know what twerking is.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.160]   I think--
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.600]   Oh, I can show you that.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:47.280]   I think the vibe-- a zylophone that uses a wooden mallet and vibes uses a softer mallet,
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   something like that.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   Okay.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.280]   I don't remember.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   Point taken.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.120]   A zylophone is what you see in a marching band.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.360]   Isn't Tony Stark's assistant named Jarvis?
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   Oh.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   Yes.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   The suit, yes.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.120]   All right, enough of Jiveon with you.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.520]   Did you see Elon Musk is building one of those?
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.520]   No.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.520]   Hand-activated.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   No.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.680]   This was one of the best moments probably on the internet last week.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.720]   I think it was on the weekend.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   He said on Twitter that he was building a motion-activated holographic design tool.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:30.840]   And then John Favreau, the producer of Ironman, responded to him on Twitter and said, "You
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.040]   mean like the one in Ironman?"
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.000]   And Elon Musk said, "Yeah, exactly like that.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.800]   I liked it so much I'm building one.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   Great idea."
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   It was just a nerdiest moment.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   Oh, yep.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   You're right.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.520]   It's what it moments.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   Incredible.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.080]   You've seen the great account, uh, uh, Board Elon Musk.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   He said we're close to the-
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   Yes.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   Oh, good.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   But this is straight out of Board Elon Musk.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   No.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.940]   Elon tweets, "We'll post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.320]   then immediately printing it in titanium."
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   Titanium.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.320]   Exactly.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.120]   I can't wait to see if he's Tony Stark.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.120]   We figured out how to design rocket parts with just hand movements through the air.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.080]   Now I need a high frame rate holograph generator.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.080]   Anyone?
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.680]   Anyone get an extra one play?
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.680]   Anyone?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.840]   Oh, God, it must be good to be the king.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.960]   Can you loop it down to me?
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.960]   Hyperloop it.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   Yeah, Hyperloop it.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   Well, Hyperloop it.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.360]   I'm ready for the Hyperloop.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.720]   I'm thinking bathroom problems with the Hyperloop.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.560]   No, no, no.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   That's the whole point.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.800]   Before you have to pee again, you're there.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.640]   35 minutes, you're in LA.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.880]   You can go a half an hour, Jeff.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.880]   You're a younger man.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.880]   Really?
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.200]   Can't even go half an hour.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:57.000]   I found I can no longer sit through the entire show, the four hour shows we do here at Twitch.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.160]   What do you do?
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.840]   I get up in the middle of the show.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.840]   Can we be doing the technology?
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840]   I did it on Sunday.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.320]   No, I did it on- or no, I did it yesterday.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.800]   On the Macbreak weekly, what I do is I try to launch a conversation about something that
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.640]   I know is just going to go, right?
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.560]   Then you run to the back.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   Then I go.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.840]   But if it doesn't go.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.840]   It didn't.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.320]   Renee Richie just stopped talking.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.000]   And all Chad could do was switch to my chair empty.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   You need a code word or something like that.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   I do.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.440]   You insert into the conversation so that everybody knows.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.760]   If you're Elon Musk, you build a robot of yourself.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.920]   Well, really, if I were smart, I'd stop drinking non-stop coffee and water during these shows.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.920]   That would probably help.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.080]   You could probably hook a catheter up to that chair or something.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   Oh, easy.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.080]   Easy to say.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   I think there's a little holder for it.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.080]   There are methods.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.560]   When you have a doctor, you have a chair.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.640]   It's got all sorts of special features.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.640]   That are astronauts, I think.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.400]   This week in P.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.400]   What are you looking at?
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.560]   Are you looking at that?
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.400]   Are you looking at it up, aren't you?
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.840]   I've characterized my host.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   All right.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.840]   Let's tell you what.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.760]   Let's take a break, come back with the change log.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.360]   So musicians, tippinists, please get your uniforms on.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.840]   We're about to put you to work for the Google change log.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.880]   But first a word from our friends at 99designs.com.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.040]   Help me out here.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.320]   Help me out.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.320]   We are.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.680]   We're ready to do something new, something fun, something exciting.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.840]   We always go to the artists at 99designs for our, like our T-shirts, our unique stuff.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:39.160]   There are at last count 246,320 designers waiting.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:44.080]   It's a very crowded waiting room waiting for you to pitch a designed launch, what they call
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:49.680]   it a design contest right now at 99designs.com.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.880]   They do logo design, web design.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.760]   They even do app design.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.320]   Currently, there are over 2,000 contests going on.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:02.280]   The payments last month to designers was $1.8 million.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:07.760]   99designs brings great, talented designers together with people who just need a little
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:14.160]   design sense for their apps or their landing page or their menus or they even do vehicle
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   wraps.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.680]   This is what, you know, so we're debating, Lisa really wants to buy a billboard on the
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   101 for Twit.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.560]   I said, don't buy a billboard.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   How much is that?
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.960]   It's an ungodly amount of money.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:29.800]   I said, for that amount of money, we could wrap cars, about 50 cars, drive around Twitmobiles
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.160]   all over Silicon Valley.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.880]   We'll get the 99designs to design them.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.800]   If you want to know more, I'll tell you what, here's what you do.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:46.680]   Go to 99designs.com/twig, 99designs.com/twig.

[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.560]   It's a $99 value.

[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:15.360]   99designs, Valerie Johnson of Big Feet Pajama Company says, when you hire one designer,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.680]   you're stuck with their aesthetic, their concept.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.080]   With 99designs, you get designs from many different people.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.800]   You work with those designers to refine it, you pick your final design and you get a great
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   deal.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   They get a great job.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.040]   It's 99designs.com/twig.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.120]   To find out more.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.960]   There are a lot of examples on the website you can see.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:41.640]   This offer ends in six days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and six seconds.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.200]   They put a countdown clock at the top.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   Look at that.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.200]   Hurry!
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   Hurry!
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   Hurry!
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.200]   Hurry!
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:59.680]   Ah, ladies and gentlemen, drummers, timpiness, flautists, horn blowers.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.680]   It's time for the change log.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:09.040]   The Google change log.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.000]   And now here's Jin to Penny.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.320]   I'll stretch this out so Leo can run to the back.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   Good.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   I'm going to leave right now.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:22.680]   Google releases the Chrome 30 beta for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.560]   The Chrome beta lets you right click or long press on an image and search for it via your
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.480]   default search provider.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.240]   So a little bit easier search by image.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.840]   The people who do the catfish show will really appreciate that.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.000]   Chrome beta for Android has received new gestures.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.520]   You can swipe across the top toolbar, the omnibox basically.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:47.680]   If you swipe across the top toolbar to switch tabs, you can drag vertically down from the
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.920]   toolbar to get into the to a tab switch review as well.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.680]   And you can drag down from the menu in order to expand it versus just tapping on it.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.600]   So some nice new gestures in the Chrome beta for Android.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.200]   In Google search, Google has improved definitions in search.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:08.480]   So if you do a search that's to define a word, so if you do define fortuitous, for example,
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.000]   they'll get that one box result in the one box you'll see now the new things there is
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.920]   sample sentences that highlight how the word is used and synonyms.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.760]   There's also a translate drop down.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.960]   So you can choose a language, translate the word directly from the one box.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.560]   And then once you choose a language, every subsequent definition search you do from there
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.840]   will automatically translate into that language that you chose.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.280]   Heaven, this is great.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.960]   It's this is really, really nice.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.080]   And that that chart of like use of the word over time is also amazing.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   Great.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   Great for word geeks.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.000]   I went to Catholic school, so the nuns beat it in my head that when you find a word that
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.120]   you don't know, you look it up and I actually do after all these years.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   I'm almost 40.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.120]   I still do it.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   I love dating.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   That's really what these guys are.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   They're just dating.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   Yes.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.120]   Yeah, they are.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   But that yeah, that one box is.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.360]   I loved it when Google got to define where you could type define colon and then the word.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.360]   I used that all the time.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.840]   But actually you don't it's not even you don't have to use the colon anymore.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.480]   Just do define space.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   That's great.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   And then the word.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.200]   So it's a little it's a little it's a little more natural.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.720]   Google now has also updated speaking of cards.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.400]   They've updated with car rentals, concert tickets and a few other.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.520]   So if you're traveling, you have car rental receipt or concert concert tickets confirmation
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.520]   in your in your box and your Gmail inbox, you'll get those show those cards in Google
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.040]   now.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.680]   Public transit cards have updated.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:37.040]   So it'll now notify you when the last train home leaves and the location that you are
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.040]   really good also for traveling.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.560]   And you can check and send a list of scores.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.080]   They've got a new football card for that.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.080]   And let's see.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.440]   Oh, they've also got a couple of new new features.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:55.360]   If you look up an artist or or any sort of media music or TV or movies, they've got a
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:00.640]   new remind me button on the card, which means they'll notify you in your favorite band or
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.520]   TV show, author releases something new.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.000]   And there's a new TV card, which I haven't actually had a chance to try.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   But Leo, you said you're smart to me.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.200]   I showed you this Google now.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.800]   No, Google now today was so weird.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.000]   I hope it goes down.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.600]   It says, I see you have a Panasonic Viera on the network.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.240]   Would you like to listen to whatever would you like me to listen to what you're listening
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.600]   to watching?
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.600]   And I'll tell you more about it.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.520]   And I said, wow, what?
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.160]   So it'll figure out what you're watching and then show you information.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.160]   That's what I'll tell you.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.760]   Here's another one that you didn't mention, but this is kind of weird is that for some
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.040]   reason it's now giving me updates on people's commute.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.040]   So I have circled somebody named Nathaniel Mosher.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.280]   I don't even know who he is.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.840]   Nathaniel Mosher has allowed you to see updates on his commute interested in updates on his
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.840]   commute.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.400]   I can say yes.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:52.320]   It's going to tell me how his commute is going.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.480]   So it says he's at work right now.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.080]   So he must be sharing his location with you.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   Which I am too.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.560]   And I think people are getting this too.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.320]   Leo would like to shoot about me.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.120]   Leo would pull.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.880]   Why would I care about somebody else's commute?
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.640]   They mentioned they were going to do this, but I just don't understand what I can't imagine
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.440]   caring about anyone except my wife's commute.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.440]   Maybe that's.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.840]   I mean, that will be useful.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.080]   I would love Google now to say, hey, yeah.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.920]   So maybe it'll just keep offering me people.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.240]   She's going to be late.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.240]   Right.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   Yeah, she's going to be late.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   Stuck in traffic.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   I love Google now.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:28.040]   Everything in the mood and Google now has given me three different versions of in the
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.880]   mood, a card saying, you know, oh, you were looking at it in the mood.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.880]   Here's your.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   No, Leo, please.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.880]   No, don't play.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.520]   But I just think that that's really great.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.520]   I don't.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.520]   I'm sorry, but I just love this.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.320]   I don't find it intrusive at all.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   It's creepy.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.320]   You're getting out of it.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   It's beautiful.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.320]   But now I'm like, smart.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   I love it.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   Like it.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   It's great.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.480]   It just surprised me at first.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.040]   I had done a search for Palm Springs.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.360]   I was looking and then suddenly Google now was giving me directions was telling me, oh,
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.480]   do you know about an hour or two hours light traffic?
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.480]   I was like, what?
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.480]   Yes.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.480]   So it surprised me.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   But now I'm like, oh, yes.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.680]   And you know, you can swipe a card away if it's not relevant.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.000]   Maybe you get a better way of letting me know because you forget to look at Google now.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.360]   Well, the widget on your on your home screen, I keep the widget on my home screen, which
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   I really like.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   Oh, you do.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   All right.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.360]   It takes up so much space.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   I don't want it to be on my home screen.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   Don't you get notifications on the on the Moto with that?
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.360]   Oh.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   Notifications.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.880]   I don't know on the home screen.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   Modifications.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.280]   I need a notification.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:30.800]   Although, you know, Google now miss par something in my inbox that made it think that I was
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.280]   traveling to Switzerland.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   Yes.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.160]   So I was getting the tips on like what hotel I should check in and switch.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.760]   I was like, I have, I don't know why this happened.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.160]   I had those same thing happen to me.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.320]   What's your one?
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:48.600]   I was like, it thought I was going to like, yeah, Lao Zan or somewhere.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.520]   Like, I don't know why you think it's Google telling you to expand your horizon.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   Maybe it's aspirational.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.360]   Maybe it's actually encouraging.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.120]   We feel you would enjoy a trip to Switzerland right now.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.640]   Wouldn't you rather be in a break right now?
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.640]   You need a break.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   You need a break.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.800]   In electronic army, like hacks Google now, forget DNS records.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.000]   You know, when they're sending Google now reminders.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.280]   How would you like to visit Syria right now?
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.880]   Say yes or yes?
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:15.880]   What?
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:16.880]   What?
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.760]   Google will take 11 hours.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.080]   I'm really looking forward to seeing what Google now does as I travel around Europe.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.280]   Oh, that's going to be a bit.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   It's fascinating.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.280]   It's fascinating.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.800]   And I bought the package of data from AT&T and 800 megabyte package of data just because
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.320]   I wanted to keep this on.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.320]   The airline thing was the most useful.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.200]   I mean, does it fit the barcode of your check in up?
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.800]   Yeah, well, you get your airport.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.800]   It goes.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   You can.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   It just pops up.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.240]   So they can just scan it and it will tell you it told me my flight was delayed.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.600]   It told me there was traffic on the way to the airport.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:58.120]   I mean, it was then that alone was worth it.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.560]   It was worth the cost of all the data.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.520]   But you have to use Gmail to get any of this advantage, of course.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.960]   Yeah, it gets it.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.080]   Yeah, it gets it from Gmail.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.400]   My wife was traveling and she had sent me her itinerary via Gmail.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.280]   So, so, so Google now was telling me how this flight is leaving then.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.640]   And then she, whatever, her flight got delayed and she had to reschedule.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:21.560]   So she sent me her new itinerary and now was smart enough to overlay those cards with
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:26.400]   the new flights and said, you know, you should be leaving for the airport now, basically,
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.360]   like it figured out that I was doing the pickup.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.160]   It was really, it's really great.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.160]   It's really great.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.960]   It's really useful.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   Okay.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.800]   One more item in the change log and this one's for Jeff.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:42.160]   Chrome OS users gain immersive mode and more in the staple channel upgrade.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.840]   So Jeff, you might have to explain what what immersive mode is.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.800]   From what I understand, it's like full screen on crack.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.160]   I didn't get a chance to take, break out my pixel and get this track.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.400]   Yeah, it just takes away every bar and every, everything.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.000]   And it's, and it's nice.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.480]   I like it.
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:02.120]   The problem is that you have to turn back on to get, you have to do something to get
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.280]   the, you know, the dress bar back, but there's certain times, so don't use it all the time,
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.320]   but there's certain times when you really want to watch something or look at something
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.880]   and get a sense of it or take it, by the way, take a screenshot.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:19.240]   Oh, that's oh that must be nicer screen shots. Yeah, I like how Android the the address bar just kind of slides up
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:25.600]   You don't see it while you're scrolling I feel like I'm really that would be useful as well or particular on the pixel when you're
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:31.540]   That's all I got for the change vlog play the comes drums
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:37.080]   The thumbs
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   It's played with a velvet mallet
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.760]   Thank you, Gina, Trapani for the Google
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:53.920]   Change log new stuff at Google Google comm of course because this is the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's March on Washington
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   Has I think a beautiful Google doodle?
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:03.080]   Can you see they also did a special media thing to watch the speech, but I couldn't get it it was broken did they
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.440]   Yeah, if you go to the Google, I think the Google
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.440]   Blog they have something about it and look they look gorgeous, but I couldn't make it work
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:17.840]   It's kind of ironic because I understand the president Obama speaking about the I have a dream speech says it belongs to all of us
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.560]   I ranically it doesn't the rights no prohibited
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:27.280]   King is very clear it does not belong to all of us no oh
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.400]   God save us from rights rights issues. Well, you know
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.960]   If you think that Martin Luther King really can look down upon this he must be saying to his heirs
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.280]   You can't take the money with you. It's the ideas that live on
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.840]   That's a mouthful Jeff
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.960]   That is a mouthful
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.480]   hmm
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:56.760]   I always that's what the Internet is probably taught me more than anything else yes, and you know my friend Jay Rosen says he's never
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:03.840]   Made a mistake by revealing an idea. He has it's always worked with yes
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.560]   And it's so it's so counterintuitive and it's so hard for so many people to get but
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.240]   Just trying it works so well
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:18.040]   Although I think Jesus said it best when he said cast your bread upon the waters and it will return to you a thousandfold
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.040]   Did he not?
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.480]   That's just casting your bread upon the water us hey, it's two thousand years old. It's not a new idea kids
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.320]   We were just talking about twerking. I'm I'm kidding like
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:36.800]   A lot of ideas Jesus had our good ideas never really got implemented
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.560]   He needed a better marketing or something. He did his best
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.880]   Oh, I was speaking of twerking in the rundown and the chat on the right. I put in oh is it there anymore? Oh
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.680]   Nick Christoff
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.240]   legendary New York Times columnist hold on a second
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:57.000]   Working he was he was trying to figure out what twerking is and so you'll see this in one
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.440]   Second there you go. Oh, no, no, no, no
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.960]   We can't unsee this I don't want twerking
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:13.980]   Actually, Jesus didn't say cast your bread upon the waters is from Ecclesiastes
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.640]   Thank you Jack room God said it God said it
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.360]   Well, why is not working the Hebrew said that good. What is this gonna be? What are we gonna see if
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:30.040]   It's a vine. It's a vine about this is by the way my problem with vine
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.480]   I see this happens to me every time I go to vine won't play it doesn't play. It's like I'm loading
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   I'm loading
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.700]   It's their servers their servers suck
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.520]   You know who owns vine
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.960]   Although I would like Twitter would have solved this by now
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:55.760]   Yeah, I think that Twitter I thought that Twitter failed its way to site stability generally. Yeah, but every time I try to play a vine
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.920]   It doesn't work
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   Never mind. It's not even that good
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.800]   So here's the here's the whole verse. This is Ecclesiastes 11 the Old Testament
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:10.360]   Cast you bread upon the waters for you will find it after many days give a portion to seven or even to eight for you
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.120]   No, not what disaster may happen on earth if the clouds are full of rain
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:20.680]   They empty themselves upon the earth and if a tree falls to the south or to the north in the place where the tree falls
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:28.400]   There it will lie he who observes the wind will not sow and he who regards the clouds will not reap
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.360]   Another word amen brother put it out there. Don't worry about what you're gonna get back
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.220]   Amen amen hallelujah
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:42.960]   Preacher preach preach preach preach you know preached great
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.480]   Did you see oh, I loved this?
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.480]   the speech that
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.600]   What's his name game?
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:57.240]   Another thing along with peeing a lot. This is another thing that comes up comes up as you get older
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:04.160]   Kevin Spacey see Matthew new Kevin Spacey gave at the Edinburgh TV festival about
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.340]   Exactly this which is there's a huge opportunity here and greed is
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.120]   preventing it from you know
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:18.960]   And this point was it doesn't matter what the platform is or what the packages or what the machine is or what the thing
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.320]   You're watching it on is it's all about the content right?
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.880]   Yeah, so good
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:33.440]   So good, I could play I'll play out Netflix or well, he's it starts with the conversation about house of cards, okay?
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:37.320]   But it really let me let me find it for you
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:42.840]   It's a big deal to have you stop it. It's a big deal
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:50.280]   It's so good. This was a YouTube event. This is the Edinburgh television festival was a YouTube event
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.920]   Well, I see YouTube on the podium
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.480]   By the way, it's a lot because this is a television. I know well
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:02.240]   YouTube horns in it's it's a message that YouTube wouldn't mind spreading to the rest of the world
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:08.320]   I think I'm gonna jump you should watch the whole thing. It's too long for us to we'll give it short shrift
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.840]   But it's if you watch the whole five-minute piece you'll love it, but let me jump
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.880]   Thrones on their computer here. Let me let me skip back a little bit here. We go for kids growing up now
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.640]   There's no difference
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:24.800]   Watching avatar on an iPad or watching YouTube on a TV or watching Game of Thrones on their computer
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:30.920]   It's all content. It's just story and the audience has spoken
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.680]   They want stories
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.400]   They're dying for them
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:43.920]   They're rooting for us to give them the right thing and they will talk about it binge on it carry it with them on the bus
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:51.840]   And to the hairdresser force it on their friends tweet blog Facebook make fan pages silly gifs and God knows what else about it
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:57.360]   Engage with it with a passion and an intimacy that a blockbuster movie could only dream of
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.640]   And all we have to do is give it to them
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.960]   The prize fruit is right there
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.240]   Shiniir and juicier than it's ever been before
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:15.040]   So it will be all the more shame on each and every one of us if we don't reach out and seize it
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.400]   And I want to leave you with the words of a man as good as any
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.840]   To address the nexus of commerce and art
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.240]   Mr. Orson wells
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.200]   Who once said I hate television?
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.400]   I hated as much as peanuts
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.960]   But I just can't stop eating peanuts
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:40.800]   Thank you so good. That's Kevin Spacey speaking at the Edinburgh TV festival and urging broadcasters and everybody else
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.360]   It's the telegraph by the way published that video, uh, Jeff
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.680]   Um to just you know get it out there. Don't worry about
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:54.400]   Channels and control get it out there people want this stuff and if you give it to them
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.480]   They will celebrate it in a way that you will you will reap the rewards
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.560]   It's interesting that that was really good. He didn't he could have gone a step further
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.800]   He was making he was separating the creators from the audience a little bit
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.880]   You know they want it from us
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.040]   He should have could have got a little step further
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.000]   And and and acknowledge that the audience creates around the things that you create as well that it's complete
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.800]   I mean he mentioned the silly gifts and the and the mashups and all that
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.960]   Uh, but but you know, there's there's still that us and them look
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.600]   Spacey has you know has earned his stripes and I guess you know, it makes sense that he hasn't us and them
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.800]   He's he's reached a level that most you know entertainers and actors don't don't reach
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.360]   But still a little bit of that us and them mindset there
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.520]   Well, that is that he's old school that he's old school. He's a old school
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.400]   They're just waiting for us to give them, you know, uh, but yeah, no, he that was good speech
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.720]   I'm definitely gonna watch the whole thing. It's a big step forward
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.440]   The next step is to say and we're all creators. Yeah, see that with my two daughters all the time the tumblr addicts
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.200]   Whenever they're watching a show
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:59.040]   Whether it's you know, dr. Who or teen wolf or whatever they discover the content through tumblr
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   They share it through tumblr. They they live blog tv shows and live tweet them
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.600]   You know voluntarily nobody's paying them to do this because they love these shows so much
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.000]   They're so invested in and and the animated gyps and the and the
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.880]   You know all the stuff that's related to it the fan fiction and whatnot is just part of that experience
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.160]   And meanwhile record companies are suing uh larry lessegg
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.920]   Yeah
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.320]   For uh for the use of a french band's hit single in a video that he gave
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.360]   Uh in an on or that he made of an online uh lecture for him for standing up to
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.960]   Yeah
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.720]   The band who could forget the band phoenix and their 2009 hit list omania
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.600]   Histomania. I remember it's pretty true. It's a movie too, right?
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.320]   Uh, he put it in a lecture. He used to music
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:55.600]   Uh lecture was describing how people had used that song to create dance videos, you know mashups and so forth
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.720]   Uh the australian record company that owned the rights threatened to sue lessegg
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.920]   He's counter sued actually pre sued
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:11.600]   In federal court accusing it of abusing copyright laws and singling him out even though his actions are fair use eff
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.360]   Uh
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.120]   To carrying the doing the water and i'm also glad because because larry's kind of
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:24.160]   Tried to move on past copyright into corruption and money he really is all about campaign finance reform right now
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.160]   Right, but he but i i'm glad he couldn't resist to go back and fight another
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.000]   Well, but i also think the reason he's in a city what he realized in this fight
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.120]   His copyright fight was until we get the money out of the pockets the corporate money out of the pockets of our uh
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.880]   Our legislators were never going to get a change
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.520]   So the first thing to do is is to eliminate the the malign influence of corporations in government
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.000]   Which is right on
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.080]   Um

[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.840]   I'd say I was humbled by this, uh, but I usually reserve that for when my car's been towed
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:44.560]   I'm very deeply honored, uh surprised and and gratified
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:52.240]   I am a member of another hall of fame, which is the rock and roll hall of fame and let me tell you there is a lot more narcissism involved
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.400]   And one of the things I really love about this
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.360]   Is that i'm looking at people
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   whose ideas were the important thing
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.440]   and who who knew that and
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.040]   Who knew the elegant solution when they saw it
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.000]   and caused it to be born
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.360]   and
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.600]   And i'm grateful to all of you because you know I care a lot about the the architecture
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.200]   Of the internet you can't endow

[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.440]   in the absence of the ability to take it away
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.600]   And so it has to be part of the architecture
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.760]   And each and every one of you has been an enormous part
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.400]   Of creating a system that is difficult to shut up
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.680]   and I I am very
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.800]   profoundly grateful to you for all of that

[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:35.360]   He actually I don't know if you watch that section when I asked him about him. He's kind of repudiated
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.120]   He said well, I wrote that a long time ago
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:41.920]   Some things are different and I went up to began an app you know, you know, you still kind of believes it

[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:14.640]   Let's start with jina tripani her tool or tip of the week
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.560]   I found this one on life hacker. This is actually a facebook tip
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.480]   If your newsfeed is overrun with stuff that you don't really care
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.040]   I care about facebook has offered a tool that will help you organize your friends
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:35.200]   Basically what this does if you go to facebook.com slash friends slash organize and chat or leo if you do this this this will show a list of your friends
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.400]   So, uh, if you're concerned about that, maybe don't don't do it on air
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.040]   You go to facebook.com slash friends slash organize and basically facebook will say to you
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.880]   Hey, here's a list of people that you haven't interacted with in a really long time
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.400]   Would you like to add them to your acquaintances list? Oh, wow
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.000]   On your acquaintances list are a quieter in a new speed
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.920]   You don't hear from them as much
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.640]   And I think really just only the post from your acquaintances that really kind of pop or have a lot of interactivity
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.120]   You show up in your newsfeed. So and it's pretty smart. I did this I did this and it was several screens
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.000]   I was like, hey people on this list you haven't interacted with them in a long time now
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.400]   Some people I was like, oh, hey, I actually still want to keep these on my friends list
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.080]   And I would like to see every post of my newsfeed, but they're actually quite a few but I thought
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.440]   I can you know, relegate them to acquaintances acquaintances
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.720]   They don't know
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.520]   If I'm not interacting with their posts or a conversion with them much then then it's a little little quieter in your newsfeed
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.520]   So I thought that's pretty it's a pretty smart tool
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.280]   And apparently it's not
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.560]   They're not facebook isn't really promoting it or there isn't a link to get to it in facebook
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.280]   But if you just go to facebook.com slash friends slash organize it will get you started
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.280]   So you'll get these are just people that you haven't had back and forth with in some way or like
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.000]   Yeah, I think the people who you haven't liked if you haven't had back and forth with you
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.520]   You just have a message with I imagine it's just people that you haven't interacted with in a while
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.720]   And you know
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.680]   on facebook, huh
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.680]   For me that's gonna be most everybody on facebook
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.840]   Yeah, right. I'm getting a lot of people who are actually like tom mara to actually you know friends
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.560]   But I guess I just don't interact with them on facebook
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:09.040]   However, there are also a lot of people who really are acquaintances. So by moving them into the acquaintances category
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.920]   I'll see less of them
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.920]   Which is so it's true if you don't use facebook a lot, basically everybody is going to be listed right
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.960]   So you can check it on check the people that you want to move
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:27.360]   But it's a nice way to kind of I mean because so rarely do we you know our so rarely do I take the time to organize my friends list
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.720]   I you know I have better things to do but like people people who I you know interacted with or worked with two years ago
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.040]   I haven't spoken to in a while. I don't necessarily want to unfriend them, but maybe I don't want to hear about
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.760]   Their dogs is Chad johnson. I don't want to hear his stories about his cats
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.320]   Oh
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.720]   Even if I haven't liked this stuff in a while
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:55.280]   But it's a nice kind of automatic way to to prune things without having to go through the list manually. This is good
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.280]   It's taking me five pages
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:03.040]   Uh, they seem to be some organization because that poll page was all people I work with so they are there's some organization
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.400]   To this yeah if you put people like on a list like if you made a twit list
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.400]   I'll go through the list. Yeah
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.920]   People from this wit list you haven't interacted with in a while you want to add them to acquaintances
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.360]   Yeah, good. This is a very useful little thing here. I'm doing it right now
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.240]   Thank you. Jeff Jarvis
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.560]   You're probably off your list
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.960]   No, no, I know I love hearing your stuff
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.280]   But there are people that I just I don't even really know who the hell this person is so
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.520]   I think i'm gonna make them an acquaintance, you know
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:39.600]   I had a couple of like who what when yeah, should I keep my accountant on my acquaintance list or my friends list
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.160]   Always so difficult to know
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.280]   How compelling are your accountant status update?
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.000]   He's a big drunk so he's actually quite fun if he's entertaining
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.560]   I went through something even more radical
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:59.440]   I started with with that type of tool and then they started instead of moving a lot of these people
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:06.160]   Into a list. I would just get rid of them completely and I think I got rid of about 80 percent of my yeah, uh, facebook
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   network and then I
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.760]   Wrote about why I did that and it's it made facebook a lot more usable
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.480]   Yeah, you really should it's a good idea to prune. I think I've heard that from a lot of people
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.120]   I just I worry about hurting people's feelings. I mean i'm being too nice
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:23.600]   And I did do that and I did do that. I had to apologize to a few people really people
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.320]   I added a few people back. Yeah, does it say Matthew just pulled you pulled to just defriended you
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.480]   How do they know but they know if they go back if they go and look at their
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.080]   Connections they can see that you're no longer connected or they can see that they're only now
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:45.040]   They're subscribed to you or following you instead of this is probably why facebook has this acquaintances feature, right?
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.600]   Yes, so you don't have to
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.000]   De-mote people without letting them know you put somebody in purgatory without telling them
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.640]   Yeah, that's also why there's a subscribe feature
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.800]   Right. I hit the lit I hit the limit not on friends, but I had the total
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.960]   I just would never say no to anybody. I just let it sit there and so I got thousands
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.360]   We're sitting there and then I couldn't add nobody could add me. I let it sit there for like nine months
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.040]   When nobody could add me it was kind of nice. I do find it thought that
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:19.360]   When I post a photo it gets liked by 15 people with foreign names who I have never
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.760]   Met and I don't understand what is going on there right like they're subscribed to me
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.760]   I guess yeah, and so yeah, I just don't understand that's all burners
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.200]   By the way, you're Canadian so that means us right yeah, yeah, okay
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.960]   More than most of the day of the world
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.640]   Don't find the startup and apply to my economy because that accent's way too thick
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.720]   I say oot and a boot oot no one will fund me
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.000]   By the way, I finished the whole process and at the end it says you've organized your friends
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.920]   Now let them know how easy it is and you can actually share this I said a nice tip from jina tripani
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:01.280]   Onto again. I can share this on my facebook timeline. So they are they are publicizing it in this fashion. You can reshare. Yeah
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.920]   Yeah, I uh, I'm so attention my attention span is so short. I I by screen three. I was like I never got there
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:12.880]   I'm so done too many screen. I'm so done
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:19.920]   So many screens. Hey, Matthew. Did you want to share anything with us a tip or an idea or anything that you think people should know about?
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:23.600]   I do have one thing that I've I've found incredibly useful
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:27.920]   on my nexus is a weather app and I know
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.520]   Everybody has their own favorite weather app and I know you know
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.200]   Everybody has it's looking for specific things. This one's called arcus
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:42.480]   Arcus and it uses dark sky. I don't know if you guys love dark sky. Yeah dark sky is pretty amazing
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.840]   So
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.320]   Arcus I've found it's you know, it's not a hundred percent accurate because no weather forecast is but it's so
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.040]   granular so you pull it up and it says
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.920]   Uh light rain starting in eight minutes
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:04.080]   Lasting for 12 minutes. Oh, it's not just it's not just oh, it's gonna rain sometime today. It's like eight minutes
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.640]   It's gonna start raining
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:11.920]   It's what's it's I find a fascinating you can get and it pulls in data from basically every
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:17.600]   You know radar installation and weather map and it just mushes them all together and it's pretty amazing
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.240]   I just installed it
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:25.360]   Love that cosine an arcus. I think I talked about this on twig. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's a great. It's a great app
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.920]   Uh and they have it's a dollar 98 for the pro version which I would guess is you know
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.640]   Fewer ads or something more stuff
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.040]   Always like more stuff
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.040]   Jeff Jarvis your number of the week
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.760]   Just a minor one
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.880]   A service called parsley parsley
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.080]   dot l y
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:44.880]   um
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.200]   Put out a little report on the traffic to news sites and the general presumption
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.080]   I think in recent years has been all facebook is overcome everything according to their sample set
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.520]   Which is the caveat?
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:00.560]   Uh google still uh drives three times the traffic to news of facebook
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.920]   So with my German friends going all mad at google just remember
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.760]   Wow
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:12.640]   That's google search not google plus or eating all google sites all google says includes plus but it's probably mostly search right?
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.720]   Yeah
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.480]   Cool that is a big difference. Look at that. I mean like towering over everybody else
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:27.920]   My uh my tool is I have two tools. I'll give you two different tools one is of all things an alarm clock
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.600]   Um, but it's just the coolest alarm clock I have ever
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.680]   Uh seen and has a feature i've never seen before it's called timely
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:42.160]   Uh and uh you want to you if you have multiple android devices you want to install it on all of them
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:48.160]   Because when you set an alarm it sets it on all your devices. So sometimes I'm yeah sometimes I miss alarms
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.960]   Uh, you're not going to miss it now because i've got i've got when when my alarm goes off on my phone
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.320]   It goes off it has a timer by the way built and it's also beautiful. I mean you can modify the theme and so forth
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.680]   It's free, but there's an in-app purchase, but when I set an alarm it'll go off on
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.560]   uh the other devices that I have
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:16.480]   Um a tent with timely installed so a nexus four hdc one nexus seven. Uh, I don't know what that is the mojo x
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.520]   So all of these go off at once
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.240]   What's the thing you don't know what it is
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:28.000]   When you dismiss uh when you dismiss the alarm when you stop it it also stops across devices. Yes
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.200]   Nice
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:38.080]   It's called timely. It's I got it on the screen here jet timely alarm clock. It's beautiful too
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.760]   Looks great on uh and you can buy uh different themes and so forth
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.880]   I realized what that other device was that was a galaxy note eight phone, which I was reviewing
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.840]   And I went and now removed from my managed devices since
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.640]   Uh somebody else has it you know the only thing is what's going off is the reason I I do
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.480]   I said it manually on more than one device because it acts as my snooze right
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.040]   Well, I double snooze this has some really good snooze features too. It's got an excellent
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.520]   uh has a variety of
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.200]   excellent
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:11.600]   Sounds for alarms. It's really kind of a neat little thing
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:16.160]   Time-sipping awkward if you were traveling and you set the alarm on your phone
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.520]   Would go off at home and all the stuff at home went off
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:23.120]   Well, that's what happens when you're a single guy. You don't really care
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.160]   Good morning home empty home
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.880]   Why are we looking at all that?
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.800]   All about android yesterday you're kidding
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.600]   This is them showing it off that when you snooze it small world when you snooze it on one device
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:39.440]   It snooze it on the other because they happen to have multiple devices with them at the time
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:42.320]   So he hits it and then on the other device it stops
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.520]   I know that because my alarm was going off all over the house the other day
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:51.280]   This is the google voice problem too, right like google voice rings and like several of my phone
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.680]   My wife hates it. She's like, uh, why is
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.200]   Well, the worst is it's not really in synchronous. It's not synchronized
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.000]   So it'll go off sooner on one phone than the other later
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.320]   Last longer on sounds it keeps ringing good way to find your devices though too, right?
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.000]   It is a good way and now my now look my computer started ringing like through hangouts
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:08.160]   Right?
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.640]   So my computer rings now and on my phone so it's it's awesome and this one is for jina
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.880]   I have one more thing for jina and um
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.440]   This is really ridiculous. You use a case on your htc1
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.320]   I did I I wound up getting a case because I checked in there was a four square special and I got it for cheap
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.240]   Uh, so yeah, it's this plastic spec case. Don't you feel bad doing it?
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:31.760]   I do I take it off I take it off a lot because I actually I really believe in like just using the device
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.600]   I love the device. You know, I want to feel it my hand. I don't want to do the whole condom thing
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:41.200]   But you feel even worse if you dropped it right exactly so I bought a ridiculously expensive case
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.200]   It's almost 60 bucks called the devil case
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:49.120]   And um, I've seen it all over google plus and I and I bought it and what it is is this is a mill to aluminum
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.000]   So it actually looks really slick
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.160]   I mean it's it feels like it belongs with the phone
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.760]   But there is and there is a negative it has tiny little screws that you have to it comes with a screwdriver
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.240]   Which I've I put somewhere and I have lost it
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.440]   Uh it comes with a tiny little screwdriver and I fortunately a couple of extra screws because I immediately lost it
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.840]   So to get the case off you literally have to unscrew it
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.200]   So it's kind of like a bumper. It's a bumper case
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.560]   Yeah, which is nice because the back of the htc1 is beautiful
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:22.640]   It is it is um, so it's really about dropping it on the edge and I have dropped my one on the edge and it does ding so
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.240]   Yeah
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.720]   And this is it's probably not a practical case
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.480]   Because it doesn't really protect anything on the other hand
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:36.320]   It's kind of cool. That's the devil case. Yeah, I got I scratched my one up here and it broke my heart
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.800]   I know broke my heart. I was like no
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.040]   It's the first car like first time he scratched your brand new car. Yeah, it's okay
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.160]   Now it's lived in
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.400]   I went into it at a day to look at the moto x don't worry. I'm not gonna play
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.920]   Um, they had to put the burglar alarm thing on the screen so you can see that they had scratched the glass. Oh
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320]   No
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.760]   It's like that chrome bookmark store. They're just destroying computers. Yeah
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.920]   Don't let your dog lick your computer or your phone. I haven't seen that
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.520]   It was a chroma. It was an old one. It was for the old, uh, you know, the samson babies were standing on it
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.720]   Remember the it was like it's for everybody in your family. It's so cheap. You don't care
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:20.480]   All right, that cheap not not my pixel. That's not the case. No, no, not certainly not with the pixel
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.880]   Hey, thank you all uh for doing this show. It's so much fun
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.160]   Matthew ingram. I cannot thank you enough for taking time out from your lake house to be with us
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.480]   I'm happy to thanks for having me
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.800]   So great to have you giga ohm.com. We were saying before the show that you are so prolific so many great articles
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.780]   And the week is only halfway done from math
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:45.200]   So check it out
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.600]   Next time matthews on we have to end the show with him jumping to the lake on the on the rope
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.440]   Can you do that just uh
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.480]   Here's what I want you to do matthews. Sure turn the camera towards the lake
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.800]   I want you to strip down
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:03.120]   As you run towards the lake your tidy whities down and whatever you feel comfortable and then jump in the lake
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.200]   And we'll end the show that way. What do you think?
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.680]   I'll give us some thought
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.800]   I try
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.840]   You can take the headset off
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.080]   Don't jump in the lake with the headset
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.920]   Uh, we got jeff javis he's from the city university of new york where he teaches journalism
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.800]   He's also the author of public parts and what would google do and is a blogger at buzz machine.com
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.120]   Don't forget google geeke anything else you want to plug
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:30.960]   Some pretty good range of stuff
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.160]   He'll be looking at a moto exit at an atnt store near you
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:40.400]   Stay the damn thing. You're perplexed. Bye the damn thing. You'll be glad you did
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:46.720]   I will think is I already bought it. I have it open the damn thing, but you now you didn't do the moto maker
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.720]   You could have had a color
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.920]   Oh, you did so you already got it. You already got it
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.640]   navy blue with a nice uh
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.280]   Silver accent, you know, that's kind of cool. You can send it back even though you've customized it
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.520]   I didn't engrave it or anything. No, not that you can still send it back. I think I don't think they care
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:06.240]   I think the engraving washes right off
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:10.400]   It's a useful feature
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:15.680]   navy blue really navy blue with a silver accent that's kind of nice
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.680]   Mm-hmm
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:23.360]   Disagree
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.120]   Pull up the plop the thing. What would you get? What would you get?
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.720]   I uh, I got red
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.240]   With uh, with also with the gray accent
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:40.240]   Moto maker.com, but i'm not gonna buy it because I don't want another atnt phone. I have far too many as it is
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.120]   I'm waiting for the unlocked moto maker
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.760]   Because I want and I want a wooden case
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.360]   Don't you want a wooden case?
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:56.320]   See I didn't like most of the colors. No, I didn't either. I think I got cherry. No, that's not I didn't get cherry
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:00.800]   That's horrible. I am so boring. I would totally just get black black. Yeah, make sure white
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   Well, the other thing though is that the the plain old white krimsen here's the one I got crimson
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.840]   Which is very lovely and then I got a uh, the front I got white
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:19.600]   Okay, and then the metallic silver for the trim is that now that's beautiful. I did I did the blue with an
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:26.080]   Mm-hmm. That's okay. That's like the thing about the red is isn't it like cars don't call like red cars have a much higher
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.880]   Rate of being stolen. I feel like the red would really sort of call attention
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.320]   You're speaking with that phone ticket buddy boy
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.360]   Then I don't know why you could pick your wallpaper
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.440]   Which I think is really kind of silly because I'm not going to use any of these anyway, but yeah
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:45.440]   That was clearly just let's know this in to make it seem really custom
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:50.240]   I do like this though that you they will they will put your google account on it
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:56.160]   You still have to put the password in so it doesn't really save you that much time but a and b if I sold the thing
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:02.480]   Speaking of which they did they changed though. They expanded the language. We talked about last week on the resale
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.680]   Oh, they did. Oh, they did clarify. That makes sense. That's why I clarify it good
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.800]   So that was just the early adopter language you can now you can out resell it
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.440]   No, no, no, no, they just
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:20.320]   Clarified the language more now. It's still the case you are allowed to sell it, but only what?
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:25.280]   You'd love to give it to friends, but but you can't if you do sell it. They won't get the warranty
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:27.360]   They won't get anything else. We really don't want you to sell us
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.600]   We don't want you to sell it too bad
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:36.320]   And what I do like you can get matching in ear headphones. So you get the krimmancy schmancy
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   schmancy fancy
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.760]   But i'm waiting for unlocked

[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.840]   That's just a good use of time. I found a really good one
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.840]   I think it's called zen pencils. It's a cart he's a cartoonist who takes
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:05.280]   uh quotes or verse and illustrates it with a comic
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.000]   It's really good. Let me see if I can
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.360]   Scroll down and find him. There's some quite artistic stuff on there
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.360]   There is and there's a lot of porn which really saves me a lot of money
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.000]   Uh
