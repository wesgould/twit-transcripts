[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And Aaron Newcomb. We're going to talk about this big AT&T time Warner acquisition deal.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   The Google Pixel. Well, the end of Google Fiber could it be and a whole lot more.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Twig is next.

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Should we recover the latest from Google?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And the Google verse.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Hey, so glad to welcome Jeff Jarvis back. He's in Munich.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   What are you doing?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Hello.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   What are you doing in Munich?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm at Munich Media in Tog. Munich Media Days.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I'm giving an address tomorrow about how to save newspapers.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Before that, I'm very excited for any German friends. I'm going to be on the Morgan magazine on
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   ZAAF, the "Today Show" kind of of Germany, talking about the election.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   The American election.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yes.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Are they very interested in what's going on over here?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You get any conversation anywhere. You get going on it.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Just wonder how the hell is this happening here?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I think we finally reached the point in the United States after the third debate where people just don't want to hear anything.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I would imagine because most people made up their mind, many of us.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I've just voted because I'm absentee ballot.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Millions of votes have already been cast.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   People are done. It's like whatever happens.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   You believe we're still...
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I think the people who go on CNN saying they're undecided are lying through their teeth.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   They just want to be on TV.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Certainly, if you are undecided, you're not commodity right now.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Everybody wants you.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Ken Bone.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Ken Bone undecided. That's Matthew Ingram.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He's decided to live in Canada.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   He's joining us now from where? Are you at home?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   At your winter home?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I'm in Toronto, yeah.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Okay.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Fortune.com.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Sad to say your longtime colleague, Stacey Higginbotham, is not here.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yeah, that's too bad.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yeah, she's taken...
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And no offense, Matthew, but you're no substitute for her.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Neither am I.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Well, Matthew always says great things about Stacey.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I never met her at Redder Valley Line for years, but you were very...
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   She's the best.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yeah, you said great things.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Great.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And it was actually one of the reasons we chased after her for this show.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's Matthew.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's because of your sterling recommendation.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I talked myself out of a spot.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That's just the Canadian way.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I've done the same thing.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I was...
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Oh, she is great.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I was doing a radio play.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I had actually auditioned for, and passed the audition for a radio play with Francis Ford Coppola.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And we were down in the basement of the Flatiron building.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It was really cool.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Nice.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Nice.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And I was still doing it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I was still a DJ in San Francisco.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I was interviewing Father Guido Sartucci, Don Novello, who had worked recently with Coppola
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.600]   in that car thing, movie Coppola did.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.000]   And I mentioned that I was doing that, and Novello had the nerve to call Coppola and
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   take my job.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Nice.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So they called me and said, "Yeah, you don't have to come back."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   All's fair and love and show business.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Damn.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   See what happens?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Never, ever.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Look where you are now.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Who's heard of him and then we're stuck in.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Whatever happened to Don Novello, he was funny.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   He got upstaged by a fake priest.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   No, Don is actually great.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   He is great.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I don't begrudge him that at all.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.760]   And the fact that I was able to sit next to Francis Ford Coppola for two nights and act
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.360]   for him was such a great privilege.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.320]   I didn't belong there.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.000]   And I was just glad to have tried to...
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   Hey, I forgot to mention our third partner in crime today.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.920]   John Newcomb is here.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   Hey.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.080]   And he's always a welcome guest on the show.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.600]   He works during the day for a NetApp.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   That's right.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.200]   But by night, he is a maker and runs a makerspace in Benesha and a regular on all about Android
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.680]   and his screensaver's mini-emer show.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   Nice to see you.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.960]   Did you make those that had set there, Aaron?
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.760]   I repaired this headset myself.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   Both of these...
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   You did a great job.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.400]   This headset broke on both sides.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.080]   I was doing this.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.560]   And both sides went...
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   And so...
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.560]   This is a little...
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   Is that Subaru?
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.920]   It's not Subaru, it's Instamorph.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.880]   And you can buy it on Amazon or anywhere else.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.160]   And it's basically plastic that melts at a low temperature.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.120]   So you can melt it in...
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.280]   I think it's like 150 to 200 degree water or something.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.600]   And then you take it out and you can mold things or do like I did and just kind of shape
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.120]   it around the thing that's broken.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.520]   And it's very, very strong.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   So I highly recommend...
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.840]   Better than Subaru for something like this.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.560]   It's better than Subaru for this because Subaru is kind of a little bit more moldables,
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   a little softer.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   It doesn't really harden.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   And this does.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   When it gets hard, it gets really hard.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.680]   And you just don't want to leave it out on your dashboard of your car or something like
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   that because it'll...
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   Again, if it gets over 150 degrees or so, it's kind of re-melt.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   Ooh.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   That's so good.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   You never take these out into the sun.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   Wow.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   I'm impressed.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.000]   So he's proving his maker chops right from the start.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Absolutely.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.840]   Right from the start, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   Wow.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840]   There actually...
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.440]   Google's been kind of busy of late.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   The biggest story and I loved the Google blog announcing it is that basically Google
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   fiber.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   I mean...
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   Dead.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   It's as dead as you can be.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.520]   Although the story from Google is more like, "Hey, isn't this great?"
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.280]   That was an amazing headline.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.960]   Advancing are amazing that...
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   Ah.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   ...by shutting things down.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.360]   And coming from the guy who's leaving.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   Exactly.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   I'm going to advance the bit and...
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   It's almost Orwellian.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   It's kind of funny because at the end of it, he says it all by the way I quit.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.920]   It's so great.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.400]   This is going so well.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.240]   I'm so sad about it though.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.320]   This is Paul from Craig Barrett who was the CEO of Google Fiber.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.640]   They had announced, or at least we had heard that maybe it wasn't an announcement, maybe
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.680]   it was a rumor that they were going to lay off a significant number of people.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.080]   This confirms that this blog post says we are not going to expand Google fiber to any
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.280]   of the markets that were on the list.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.080]   And I'm out of here.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.480]   But it says our business is solid.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.200]   Our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   We expect growth to continue.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.320]   But we should have been putting this down.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.320]   It's like violence.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   People that I'm quitting.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   Verizon stopped Fios as well.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.320]   It's like Fios.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   That stopped too.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   Do you think 5G does replace?
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.120]   Is that some point for...
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.120]   We had had this conversation when the rumor first came out and I'm trying.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.800]   I think that was...
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.160]   Maybe it was Ben Thompson's plays.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.080]   He's very good on this kind of strategic stuff.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.440]   I think it was he who said, "Yeah, this is Google finally acknowledging that it's too
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.680]   expensive to put Fios in.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.680]   It's never going to turn a profit."
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.800]   He mentioned it again.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.440]   I think it was today.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:23.400]   And he said, "Basically Google over promised and had no concept of what they were going
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.640]   to have to try and build.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.840]   You can't just roll out fiber.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.600]   This is a massive, massive investment of time and resources you need specialized people
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   doing it.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   It's a gigantic thing that they said they were going to do.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.960]   It's no surprise they basically admitted they can't do it.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   What if the real purpose of this was to get the other internet service providers to wake
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   up, smell the coffee.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.240]   In fact, in the market, Google did offer Gigabit.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.440]   So did their competition Comcast and Time Warner.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.880]   And it did do that.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   It did do that.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.120]   So what if they're really saying they should have accomplished?
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.920]   But was that their main goal?
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.680]   That seems hard to believe.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.480]   Because they spent a significant amount of money just to prod their competitors.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.800]   I mean, that would be a pretty selfless act even for Google.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   This is really the work of Ruth Porat, the new CFO.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:28.760]   All across the board throughout Alphabet, the story goes that Porat is cutting, is rationalizing
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.800]   these moonshots.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.320]   I think initially, Larry and Sergey had just a lot of money.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.360]   And no, I seriously believe this.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.240]   You probably know better than anybody, Jeff, because you were interviewing them at the time
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   and stuff.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.160]   But I feel like they just said, hey, we got a ton of money.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   Let's do something interesting.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   Let's do something good.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.360]   Let's do flying cars.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.480]   Let's do autonomous vehicles.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.320]   Let's do project loon.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   We don't share--
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   Well, it's also the industry.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.320]   I think Matthew's right.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.120]   I think there was some notion to influence the industry.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   And they succeeded.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.360]   Look at the AT&T time Warner.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.800]   You have Stevenson saying that neutrality is a done deal.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   It's awesome.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.360]   Oh, it's over a done deal.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   Not it's a done deal.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   We accept it.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   We're going to excel, right?
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   I think so, right?
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   Wow.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   No, it's still there we don't have to pay.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.560]   But before we do, I do think that what happened to Google is reality said and they
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.200]   realized that ads weren't going to keep them-- they needed a second chapter.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:37.080]   And they've now with Alphabet and with Ruth Porat and with Sundar Pachai and Larry Page,
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   they've all kind of unified to say, look, we've got to find our next chapter.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.160]   We can't just frivolously create flying cars.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.360]   This has to be a business.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:53.320]   Although I have to admit, I regret-- or I'm going to miss that side of Google, the side
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:02.480]   where they just decided to do crazy, ambitious, even impossible things, even things that didn't
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.720]   appear to make a whole lot of sense.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.160]   Thank God we still have Elon Musk.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.400]   So basically, we're saying-- is Sergey is now was.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.960]   Yeah, don't you-- well, what do you think, Jeff?
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.920]   What do you mean?
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.120]   In the sense that was was the creative genius and any kind of got pushed farther and farther
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.760]   and farther off and out, Sergey is Mr. Bunchot.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   I mean, Larry loves Bunchot too, but--
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   You could make the argument.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   It's just maturity.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   I think it is.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   I think it is.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.440]   Well, maturity is boring.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440]   It is boring.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   Tell me about it.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   Tell me about it.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.480]   That's why innovation doesn't happen from incumbents.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.680]   It happens from lean and hungry young graduates.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.240]   Like HVN-T in Time Warner.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.640]   All right, so let's talk about that.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.240]   That's kind of a big deal.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   You know what?
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.400]   I have decided-- I did mail my vote in, but I want to get it back because I'm going to
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.000]   vote for Donald Trump because he says he's going to stop it.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.480]   Right.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.200]   I don't know if the president can just by fiat say no, you guys can't merge.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.040]   Mm, pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.360]   I think you have to get some agency to go along.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.000]   The FTC or the FCC.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.400]   Clinton says she's at least going to have an investigative committee, which is kind of
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.960]   passing the buck.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.440]   But what is wrong with AT&T buying Time Warner?
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.440]   Wow.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.760]   What isn't wrong?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:38.520]   I mean, to me the biggest issue is that you're going to have just a massive centralization
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:44.360]   of control and a massive sort of acceleration of zero rating.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   Zero rating is just when some-- like T-Mobile does this one.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.640]   A carrier says, "We won't count this against the bandwidth cap."
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:01.200]   And so the presumption is that time-- in fact, Time Warner is probably going-- AT&T has announced
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   that they're going to offer a direct TV now, which is an over-the-top streaming series.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.680]   All zero rated.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.320]   Which will presumably be zero rated, right?
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.120]   It would just be effectively no bandwidth cost to you.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.680]   Remember, though, that in Florida for this to succeed, it has to go over Comcast's internet
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.440]   service and everybody else's too.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.040]   You can't just be AT&T.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.040]   Right.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:27.400]   So that would make no sense for AT&T to buy all this content for $100 billion and then
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.680]   say no one can have it unless they're on the AT&T network.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.160]   But what they can say, because we don't have a sort of consistent rule on zero rating,
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.880]   is they can say, if you're on AT&T, you get it free.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.120]   And if you're not, you don't.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.120]   And so that inherently privileges content that's part of that AT&T package.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.600]   AT&T would own all the content assets of Time Warner.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.880]   Not the cable business, because Time Warner already spun that off the spectrum.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   It's every time, right.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.120]   But they would own-- Turner Broadcasting, CNN, Warner Studios.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120]   Yeah, HBO.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   Not Time Magazine.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.080]   They also spin that off, but it would be this.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   The old--
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   The old--
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080]   Time Inc.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   Where I work.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.680]   But they don't Spider-Man Batman and Superman.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.160]   They don't Mad Magazine.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.080]   Dick E. Bartola told me.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.080]   Is--
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:28.840]   I mean, to me, the only way they can justify paying that amount for Time Warner is by
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:36.080]   using zero rating to-- there's no other justification for paying that much money.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   They're paying a massive amount of money for Time Warner.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   Well, yeah, I think--
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.200]   Yeah, I'm a bad guy than the last bid.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:51.080]   It's also a hedge saying that-- I mean, just what media communications business is going
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.320]   to be good going forward?
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.040]   If you're in the dumb pipe business, which AT&T is, then maybe you want some smarts in
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   there just for hedging purposes.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   Yeah, so that assumes that Time Warner has smarts.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   Well, that's--
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   Well, that's--
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   --but actually, yes.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   It's awesome.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.080]   They have content.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.920]   And I was just saying to someone, I do realize that that's why they're doing it.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.700]   They're trying to make the dumb pipe as smart as possible.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.700]   Meanwhile, companies that are smart already are effectively getting pipes.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:27.160]   And so I think it's actually a lot easier for a smart company with content to get access
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.060]   to pipes than it is for a dumb pipe company to become smart.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.900]   This is the--
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.900]   --there were a retread of killing--
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.900]   --and there all those changes.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.900]   Yeah, Aaron.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.240]   Here you got these media types are jumping on this one.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.900]   Yeah, I mean, this isn't up my alley.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:47.160]   The only thing I can say is maybe they really, really, really just want to run Netscape Navigator.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   Well done.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.080]   I mean, they have to be somewhat influenced by the other dumb pipe companies.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.920]   Verizon's been snagging content right and left, including Yahoo.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.720]   Dumb content, not the best content.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.360]   Although maybe they're not going to buy Yahoo.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   You never know.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.280]   The template for this, though, is Comcast and NBC University.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   Right.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.440]   Which, by the way, sailed through, as I remember, sailed through regulatory.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   Because it's all vertical.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440]   Similar.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   His is vertical too.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.240]   And in fact, they've been bragging.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.720]   AT&T has been bragging.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.360]   This is going to be an O'brainer.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.240]   It's all vertical.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.640]   And that neutrality is a done deal.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.400]   So we don't have to worry about that.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.840]   If so fact, we're done.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.360]   So either there's consensus among the dumb pipe companies.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   Crap.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.800]   This is going to be a commoditized business with no revenue upside.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.120]   We've got to find a way to differentiate ourselves.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.640]   Or it's one of those lemmings we're all going to jump off the cliff together.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.560]   And let's just see what happens when we get to the bottom.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.800]   Probably a bit above.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.440]   Jeff, is this in any appreciable way different than Comcast and NBC University?
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440]   It's a lot bigger.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.480]   Different level of concentration.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.880]   I was thinking about it.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:15.600]   I think that everybody lumps these things together that they call content.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.840]   And I think that there's at least three different things going on here.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.720]   The business that I'm in journalism is information-based business, which is separate from entertainment,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.040]   which is a story-based business, engagement-based business, which is separate from social, which
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.680]   is a connection to communications business.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.560]   And those three keep on kind of merging around and melding and people are trying to figure
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.160]   out what it is.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:47.480]   So you look at what they're not in is the social business, Facebook's in it, YouTube's
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480]   in it.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:54.040]   And what they are in, what they're trying to be in is the communications part and the
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   entertainment part.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.960]   The information is of no value, that's why Time Inc. was sloughed off.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   Sorry, Matthew.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   But we-
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   So, that's right.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   Matthew, you worked for Fortune.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.200]   You're part of Time Inc.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   I forgot.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   I kind of am, yeah.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   The sloughed off.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   The part that was sloughed off.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   I still have the epic.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   I still have the epic.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   So...
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   I apologize.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   I have been very cavalier with Matthew's.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.240]   It's fine.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   It's fine.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.240]   I write about this stuff, so.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.160]   So, you're saying content, there's content and there's content and there's good content.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.160]   What would be the content?
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.200]   If you were a dumb pipe business, what kind of content?
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.760]   You would want video content, wouldn't you?
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.760]   Well, I'm not sure.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.360]   You know what I'm saying is, I think that you want something that's not content.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.560]   I think what you want is to enable people to connect and communicate and-
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]   Social.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   Communities.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   You want social.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560]   Right, and content.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.560]   I think we do.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.640]   It's as a layer on top of content.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.960]   That's BS, right?
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.600]   Social is its own thing.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   The content is a tool.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.640]   So, Twitter is one of these.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640]   Should buy Twitter.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   There's the social.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.240]   Well, not for 20 billion.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.440]   Well, I would say YouTube and- or Facebook and YouTube are the two that work.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   Plus Snapchat, Instagram.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.720]   You don't need an interesting play.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:19.080]   This morning, and I don't think it was widely recognized yet as a play for social as Microsoft.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.360]   Among the announcements Microsoft made this morning is a big new social network for Windows
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.120]   and Xbox based around its gaming platform.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.400]   And frankly, that's a very interesting play.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   Look at Twitch.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   Look at YouTube.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.160]   Look at the people watching gaming videos.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160]   Twitch is fascinating.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   And chatting.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:45.600]   And what it is is a social network with something going on, which kind of facilitates the chat
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.560]   and kind of keeps it interesting.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.520]   And it allows- it does something really interesting because instead of having this kind of free
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.600]   form, everybody equal chat, you have a content creator, the gamer.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.000]   And you have them create a chat room around what they're doing.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.760]   So there's all these mini micro communities within a larger community.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.360]   It's been I think very successful for Twitch.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   Amazon bought Twitch for that reason.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   Huge success.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.640]   YouTube is trying to get in that business as well.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.920]   All of a sudden here comes Microsoft.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.000]   Which owns the platforms.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   It owns Windows and it owns Xbox.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.040]   Adding this capability directly to the platform.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.120]   And I don't think it was really- it has yet been to be recognized that that's the other
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.000]   thing Microsoft was up to this morning.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.400]   That's very interesting.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.840]   I think to Jeff's point, I think it's- we're already seeing that it's easier and possibly
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:43.360]   more effective for Facebook, a social network, to add content than it is for content companies
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.920]   to add social elements.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   Yes.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.840]   There's certainly farther ahead than any media company I can think of.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:57.800]   And it's because they're adding the content into a place where people are already socializing.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.040]   As opposed to trying to do the reverse.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:06.200]   But yeah, you know, the better- how much would it have cost to buy a snapshot?
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   When?
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Now.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.040]   Versus- versus time Warner.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.280]   25 billion.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.280]   A lot cheaper.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.280]   Better deal?
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   The 85 billion.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.040]   Well, better deal, that valuation is mind-boggling.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.280]   That's like astronomical.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.440]   I think the problem with Snapchat and the thing that would make me nervous is there's no guarantee
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   that it's sticky.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.640]   I mean, I think you're kind of- There's no guarantee that time Warner survives.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.640]   And I mean, 100 billion.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   But you have some sticky stuff.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.640]   You have HBO.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.200]   That's pretty sticky.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.080]   I think actually HBO is the single biggest thing in there.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.280]   I think CNN is pretty important too.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.440]   Yeah, no, and that's- and it's great.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:53.400]   But in terms of- in terms of what they need to do with content, HBO, I mean, effectively
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.440]   they need to make HBO a competitor in Netflix.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:02.280]   Does HBO loan its content, does it- or is it like NBC where it's buying content to-
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.280]   Competition.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.600]   It's trying to do both.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.400]   But they own pretty much-
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   Pretty much from-
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   Right.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   They own that.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   They pay-
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   And they're creating more just like Netflix is.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   So, you get the margins.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.680]   If it goes big, you keep it all instead of just getting-
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:25.040]   The thing that complicates this is the announcement today that AT&T is going to do this direct
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.200]   TV now thing.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.200]   Which is very interesting.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.640]   There's already skepticism.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.200]   People are comparing the AT&T time Warner deal to the famously bad AT&T time Warner AOL
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.920]   deal, which fell apart.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.920]   And now-
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   Still hurts me.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.120]   I actually think I wrote a something and I was- this was partly for argument's sake,
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.000]   but I actually believe this may be worse.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Some are saying that.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.560]   Not necessarily financially because that was a massive massively overvalued deal.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.080]   But at least the intention of that deal was to kind of look towards the future.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.360]   AOL was at least theoretically more connected to what was the future.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.480]   I don't see how time Warner is connected to any theoretical future that AT&T needs
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.760]   to have, other than just content to shove down a pipe.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.600]   Does it clarify AT&T's intentions?
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   This direct TV now.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:25.360]   First of all, direct TV, which was an AT&T acquisition a couple of years ago, is faltering.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.800]   So what they're doing is they're taking that brand and saying, "Forget the satellites."
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.080]   Which is, of course, the most expensive part of that brand.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   Forget the satellites.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.640]   We're going to do it over the top, an internet channel, and we're going to do it 100 plus
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.840]   channels for the lowest cost of any of these over the top players, $35.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.800]   Now they don't say which channels.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.600]   And it's going to be free if you're on AT&T.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   Because it's zero rated.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   Right.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   See, I think that's huge.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.440]   I mean, I've said that.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.920]   What?
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.400]   They said that?
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   Yes.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   Okay.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.360]   So Monday, Randall Stevenson is the CEO while talking about the acquisition of Time Warner.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.680]   Just let this slip.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.480]   It'll launch in November.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.200]   So with that information, is that change?
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.400]   How we see Time Warner?
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   Is it really?
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.120]   I mean, that's a way to get HBO on your direct TV now.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.120]   True.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.120]   CNN.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   CNN.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   They want to stream everything.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.920]   Like they said, when they've been talking about direct TV now, they want to stream everything
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   eventually.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.160]   They may even do Alacart.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.440]   So it may not be a package of 100.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.800]   It may be pay for what you want.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.440]   And see prior discussion about, sorry, see prior discussion about generation.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.560]   This is going to be mobile.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   Right.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.880]   So Comcast has a huge investment in and pipes in the ground.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:55.240]   When I worked with my brief, brief period as an executive at Time Warner, the one time
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:02.080]   I went on the corporate retreat on the company Jet to Bermuda or some Island, they had just
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:09.240]   decided to sell Temple, England, which was a timber company because we are a publisher.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.440]   We need to have papers.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.080]   Let's own the paper.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.840]   Pardon me.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.760]   And then they said, well, we're going to buy all these cable companies.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.800]   And I stupidly raised my hand because I'm shocked and I was young.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.600]   And I said, aren't you just trading one pole for another?
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   Oops.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   Nice.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   For us, no to close.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   But it along.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   You were right.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   It's not that you weren't right.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   Just one of the casual community here at the party.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.040]   I think this whole trend is especially relevant, especially the direct TV news.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.840]   And when you put it in light of what Comcast is doing with XFINITY charging, you know,
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.200]   putting a cap on people now and charging a, I mean, it doesn't sound like much.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.040]   But I got the notice yesterday from XFINITY saying, you know, only 1% of our users will
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040]   be affected.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.160]   By the way, you're in our 1%.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   You're the 1%.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.080]   I'm the 1% now.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   You're using one of the terabyte.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.120]   I'm absolutely using more than a terabyte because I'm backing up all my files to Google
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   with Drive.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.480]   I'm backing up all my photos.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.160]   I'm streaming media all day long.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.360]   I'm not watching TV over the, over the cable or broadcast.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.040]   Well, sometimes broadcast, but never cable.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.800]   And so I think that, you know, AT&T sees this trend and they want to get in on it.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.880]   It's going to be a huge competitive advantage for them.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.000]   If they can say, Hey, here's all this free content that you can stream, you know, for
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.920]   free from us as opposed to paying, you know, Comcast $50 a month for just, just, just for
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.560]   the availability of streaming that content over other networks.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.400]   This is AT&T's play for the future.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.720]   They understand that dumb pipes don't make any sense.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.120]   The content is king.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.720]   They're going to, they're going to bypass.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.120]   They're going to go over the top and they're going to go over the go beyond the cable and
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.200]   look who they're aiming at.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.280]   This is the direct TV now website TV beyond your wildest dreams.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.280]   It's coming.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.920]   Leave your name and email here.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.360]   We'll hit you up later with the deets.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:14.640]   This is aimed at the sub 25 year old who has never had broadcast.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.240]   How do you do fellow kids?
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.760]   That's all I thought of.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.160]   How do you do fellow kids?
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.240]   This is completely aimed at the new, this is the future.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.360]   This is AT&T saying, all right, we're going to, we're going to plan for the future and
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.400]   we're going to have H by the way, $35 a month and I get HBO and CNN.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   It might be enough.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.960]   They have considerably more than that.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:41.600]   They've already got deals with Disney, NBC, Universal, Turner, AMC, Viacom, Scripps, Stars,
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.000]   A&E.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.040]   You know, of course, the big problem is you don't have the live locals.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   We're doing this in the face of exactly the same plan from Apple.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.360]   Apple has yet to make any deals at all.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.400]   Fox and CBS just made a deal with Google, right?
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.840]   For a similar virtual bundle, you've got Sony View, which is more expensive for the less.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.240]   But it's not going to be zero rated.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.840]   And it's not going to be zero rated.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.360]   Like to me, this makes total sense to me as a consumer.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.480]   This is a great deal.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.720]   It's a cheap price.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.320]   You get a ton of content.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   That makes sense.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.760]   But the fact that to me, it doesn't work like their whole model is not going to work unless
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.760]   without zero rating.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.640]   And zero rating is a hugely problematic topic.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:30.680]   If they effectively privilege all that content that comes through DirecTV now or through however
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:36.720]   they're streaming it, then Stevenson said something like, "Oh, Netflix will be fine."
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.680]   Well, the point is not whether Netflix is going to be fine.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.480]   The point is whether this model effectively cripples new services that might come along
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   that can't afford to pay to be part of that package.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   You're going to watch Twitter.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   You're going to watch Twitter if it counts against your bandwidth caps.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.880]   No, of course you're not.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   No.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.760]   Especially if you have all this other stuff.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.880]   I mean, obviously Netflix can afford to pay whatever fee they want.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.880]   They've got billions of dollars.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.320]   No, the incumbents are fine.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.520]   It's, as you say, it's where it kills innovation.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.080]   But if Aaron took out, Aaron, if you took out all of your entertainment watching out of
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   that bandwidths, hogging you do, where would you be?
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   I bet it's probably maybe a quarter of that bandwidth.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:32.040]   Now when you get a 4K TV and you start streaming 4K video, that's going to change.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.040]   Yep.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   Yep.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.640]   I mean, me and my kids are always on games all day long, downloading the latest games,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.320]   which is a huge download right there.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.400]   But then just playing games constantly online, you know, bumps that ticker up even more.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.520]   I got to say, by doing that Comcast is playing right into AT&T's hands.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   Yep.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520]   Exactly.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.160]   And I don't think there's any technical or financial reason they should have a cap.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.800]   I think that that's greed.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.000]   But boy, you know, rethink this Comcast because here comes AT&T with an offer that says, "Well,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   don't worry.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   We won't count.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.600]   We may have bandwidth caps, but it won't count against the stuff you do."
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.240]   By the way, this is a variety says, and I think this is probably everybody's agreement,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.200]   at $35, this is a loss leader.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   For sure.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.840]   This is not a, this is so where do they make their money?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.480]   It's 50% cheaper than at least a couple of the competitors.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.960]   So how do they pay for this?
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:28.160]   And it's been shown that companies that do zero rating typically have much lower bandwidth
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.720]   caps than companies that don't.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   Well, let's talk about this.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.760]   So they're going to hit you one of the channels.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.640]   These channels make a huge amount of their money, obviously, for consumer fees.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:46.560]   If AT&T devalues this content and it's buying channels that make money through consumer fees,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.360]   that's not making sense to me.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:55.760]   It's, there's more, there's another angle too, which is, let's say AT&T is, is giving
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.400]   sort of privilege access to things that are zero rated through, whether it's direct TV
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.440]   now or whatever, what about when it goes to try and get say CBS or somebody like that
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.920]   to play along with, or NBC to be part of the package?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.440]   Is Comcast going to say, "Yeah, sure, we'll license you NBC Universal stuff or whatever
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.520]   so you can push it through your zero rated computing?"
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:23.120]   Well, that's the thing that scares me the most is that you start seeing siloing of content.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   Exactly.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:30.160]   And then HBO, and now you have to have AT&T if you want to watch NBC or Universal stuff,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.960]   you have to have Comcast.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.520]   Now that's something where I have to think the FCC would step in and say, "And it's,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.560]   but there's been threats of that for many, many years in many ways.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.880]   You know, in the early days of mobile phones, they were going to have original content,
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.760]   you couldn't get anywhere else.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.320]   Apart from some sports deals, it really hasn't happened.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.800]   Yeah, I think that's the kiss of death.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.160]   And I think customers revolt.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:59.520]   If the FCC doesn't do anything, then customers remember the music industry learned this at
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.520]   their peril.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.440]   The real competitor is piracy.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   Right.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.760]   And so, and they do this at your peril.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.800]   You make this expensive, you make this hard, fine.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   I'll download Game of Thrones and you'll get nothing.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.200]   And it's going to be really interesting to see what happens to this deal as it sort
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.480]   of goes through the process of closing.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:25.640]   If the FCC does decide to use this as a time to say something about zero rating, they've
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.720]   kind of hinted at it.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.400]   They said they're looking at it.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.840]   They said they're concerned about it.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.040]   If they decide to make an example of the steel, that could remove a significant amount
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.480]   of the rationale for doing this deal at all.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:46.280]   You know, we knew that this was going to be a disruptive period of time, that we were
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.880]   entering into this IPTV era.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.160]   It's been very ugly already and it's going to get uglier.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.720]   I mean, that's just what happens in disruption.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.360]   And what you're seeing is everybody jockeying for position and trying to have, you know,
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.680]   with a crystal ball forecast.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:06.080]   And it's interesting that AT&T has that verbiage on its direct TV now site.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   It's really, it says, all right, well, forget you oldsters.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:16.760]   We're going to go after the millennials and we want to own them for the next 50 years.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.040]   But does, does AT&T have a great reputation with users of any kind, let alone millennials?
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.880]   I find that hard to believe.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   Nor does Comcast.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.640]   I mean, frankly, none of these guys do.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.000]   Everybody hates Verizon, AT&T, a Comcast.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.840]   Find one person that likes any of that.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.040]   And so there are only strategies to lock you in somehow because they know they can't win
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   you over.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.320]   Meanwhile, Google and Apple do have good, you know, reputations.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.640]   They could play this game, right?
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.760]   And I'm really looking forward to both of them.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   And Facebook.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.360]   It's interesting to see Google signing those deals.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.880]   It's been so long.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.120]   They've been working on something like that for five years.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.480]   But they've never been able to get the TV guys to play ball at the price that they want
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   them to.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Is Twitter a player too?
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.080]   I mean, Twitter really wants to, well, have you watched TV on Twitter?
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   And they're doing it.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   I mean, they're just-
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   It's very limited.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   They can't, right.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:09.160]   And they can't, they basically can't afford to do the things that Google and Apple can
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   do.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:15.360]   They, they could afford to pay 10 million to the NFL, but they can't afford to pay hundreds
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.920]   of millions of dollars, right?
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.440]   They're financially just not there.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.240]   This is actually a game of, not game of drones.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   It is drones.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   The game of nets.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   It's really, it is.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:30.840]   There is a vacancy and there everybody's, you know, coming for it and winter is coming
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   for users.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   And it really-
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.800]   And it's coming for TV companies too.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   I mean, that's why they're doing it.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.040]   Isn't, aren't the content companies safe here?
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   Isn't this-
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   No.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.560]   Doesn't this put them in the, in the, in the cap or seat?
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   No?
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   Well, they're not so-
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.480]   It doesn't make them safe.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.680]   I think it gives them good bargaining power.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   What?
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.680]   So HBO needs to get-
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.800]   HBO needs to get social, Jen?
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   No, no.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.360]   What I'm saying, what I'm saying is that this is where I'm talking about these three
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.160]   layers, right?
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.280]   There's, there's entertainment, there's, there's connectivity and there's information,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.240]   which other information aside.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.760]   And you can't just add social to content.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.680]   So you, that's why YouTube, you, what the, the party that's blowing it so far here, I
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   think is YouTube.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.720]   If you, anyone's going to own the young ends and give them deets.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   It's, it's YouTube.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:25.520]   And the other party that had, that is screaming video, video, video, but is not showing a strategy
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.680]   yet is Facebook.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.200]   So that's the two that I think that they're scared of.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.160]   Now whether they get their acts together and actually become the new entertainment medium
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:40.800]   because you can be both entertainment and social, that's the potential of where this
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   goes.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   And I think Facebook is going to get there.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.120]   I think that's why AT&T decided to do this and decided to pay so much because they're
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:53.080]   afraid that once Facebook starts turning it on and, and tries to become effectively a
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.960]   broadcaster and distributor and pipe that they will win.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.400]   They have, they don't have, there's a card missing from their hand.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.400]   That's the zero rating card.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   Right.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.080]   Only a, only a bandwidth provider can do zero rating.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:16.600]   If you believe, if you believe that TV as you know it is the, the, is going to grab most
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.000]   people's time and attention.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.480]   This is why, this is why I always call on my seminal experience going to VidCon.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.560]   And I'm going to go to VidCon every damn year.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:33.000]   I can because it teaches me how people view, you know, I went to a session at VidCon with
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.160]   YouTubers on stage talking about how they had talked about their mental difficulties,
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.920]   whether that was anxiety or depression or suicidal or eating disorders or whatever.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   Right.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.720]   And then the, in the audience, so-called audience were people who had experienced the same thing.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.240]   My point about social is it's not that you, gee, I can talk, I can have a game around
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   Game of Thrones.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:59.000]   My point about social is there was a, a human tie of empathy there that simply does not
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.720]   exist in the one way.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.440]   Well, it's why podcasting is, it, it, it's exactly.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   Exactly.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.000]   It's some degree benefits from that.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Yes.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.040]   And I think it's also, if you accept that video with this is where I thought Jeff was
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:18.960]   going, if you accept that video is becoming a lot more, um, atomized and sort of disaggregated
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:25.240]   and linear television, as we know it is sort of going away, whether it's through binge
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:31.760]   watching multiple episodes or the reverse where it's micro micro chunks of content, that's
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.040]   a game that Facebook is predisposed to win.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.360]   That is not a game that time Warner is predisposed to win.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   And so-
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   But don't you think people will want both?
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.840]   I don't think it's going to be mutually exclusive.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.000]   No, I think they will want both and they will continue to want both.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.720]   But there's more of one than the other.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   One, two.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.160]   But there's separate, there's separate worlds that we, we, we pulled all three together
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.600]   and called the media and storytelling.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   And they got started by atomized.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   And they're all being atomized.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   They were advertising.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.640]   And, and what we're seeing is a new leveling of water in the new city.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.600]   But it is still a vibrant ecosystem and there's a number of, you know, there are a number
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   of niches here.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.600]   Totally.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   And that's good.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   And actually, I believe Amazon is going to be a player too.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.240]   Amazon is spending a ton of money to develop original content.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.840]   I would not count Amazon's watch.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.560]   Amazon's watch transparent over the last two nights.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.160]   We've got some great shows and they are willing to spend to come up with them.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.520]   You know, they're going to launch the music service as well.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.920]   I was just going to say how long is it before Verizon buys Netflix in?
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.680]   So Netflix is one that everybody, for a while their Disney was talked about.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.640]   Apple has, people have talked about them by Netflix.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.520]   I don't think Netflix wants to sell, which means if you want to buy it, it's going to
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.800]   cost a massive amount of money.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   Ostal acquisition.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   It's going to be.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   I was just thinking between, you know, maybe if you combine Netflix with Yahoo, maybe you'd
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   have something.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   It's a similar.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   You're a disaster.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   One of the things is interesting.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   I agree.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:12.160]   I think you have Netflix minus 10.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.960]   One of the things is interesting is about this AT&T acquisition is that they seem to have
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.160]   thrown price out the window.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:24.600]   In other words, definitely at this point they're saying, you know what, no matter what it costs,
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   we got to do this.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.400]   And that's why it feels like a Hail Mary pass to me.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.400]   It's a Hail Mary.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.400]   I think it is a Hail Mary.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.280]   Well, there are those that argue that time order is being undervalued and full disclosure
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.440]   for my days working there.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.440]   I still own that stock.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.440]   Who's arguing that?
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.440]   Jeff.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.440]   I'm seeing it.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   I'm seeing it.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.480]   No, I'm seeing it, which amazes me.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.960]   I mean, this deal is orders of magnitude larger than previous offers.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   And on any multiple basis, it's way over.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   It's a lot of time.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.880]   You know what's frustrating to me is that Google and YouTube just don't seem to get
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.840]   the urgency here.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.600]   That's because they are the urgency, Leo.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.880]   I do think YouTube, they're in the cap or seat, but I don't know if that's forever.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   No, it's not.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.840]   They better get their act together.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:14.280]   But they've got to, again, I think we're looking at, I'm not going to say millennials
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.920]   and kids, but I do think that there's a, you know, we don't know.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.000]   Look at our kids and our kids do watch.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   My kids watch those.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.160]   YouTube exclusively, 22 year old.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.160]   Exactly.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.200]   I think that there's a world of just non-Amazon media companies.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.720]   Amazon's acquisition of Twitch makes a lot more sense now.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   And actually, did you see Twitch?
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.200]   As you showed Jeff Bezos was prescient.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.720]   Twitch is rolling out shows.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.680]   So basically there's a cooking show that they're launching.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.720]   So it's not just watch, you know, so and so play.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.080]   They tried the Bob Ross thing and that went so well.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   They're realizing people will watch content.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   It was fascinating.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   And I'm really interested.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.160]   Exactly what Twitter wishes they were doing, which is chat around content.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.160]   And I don't think, so Twitter is too kind of broad and diffuse.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.640]   Like Twitch, it's easier to...
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.840]   Twitter is too dirty and nasty.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   Focus.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   That too.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.920]   Well, believe me, Twitch chat can be equally nasty.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   Definitely.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:20.200]   We've seen at least two companies suggest that the kind of trollies, you know, offensive
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.480]   nature of Twitter was part of what kept them from making a deal.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.680]   Both Salesforce and Disney.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.480]   Well, you know, you got the same thing in YouTube comments.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.400]   You got the same thing in Twitch chat.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.680]   If any, all of these companies are going to have to somehow deal with this.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.560]   Twitch is very aggressive at banning channels.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.360]   If there's any nudity, boom, you're gone.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.640]   And YouTube comments have gotten better, have they not?
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   No.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.840]   Well, they got better briefly because of Google+, and then they just...
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   Oh, really?
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   And then they went right back to...
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.360]   Let's take a break.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.680]   This is a good conversation.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.880]   I'm having some fun here.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.440]   Jeff Jarvis is staying up late in Munich.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.800]   And thank you, Jeff, for doing that buzzmachine.com.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   And what would Google do?
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:08.760]   Regular poster on Medium and elsewhere and follow them on Facebook too.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.680]   Between you and Robert Scobull, there's nothing...
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.000]   There's no room for anyone else in my Facebook feed, but I have to say...
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   I'm not sure what I think about the way I'm calling it all.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I'm not comparing you to Scobull.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.080]   I was about to finish that sentence, which is the value of your posts much higher.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.880]   Robert's just on a tear on Facebook.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.800]   I think the two of you have realized that this is the social platform.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.120]   But I can't get off Twitter.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   I...
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.960]   No, lots of tweets are on Facebook, right?
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   That's why I'm saying that.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.240]   For me, Twitter has become a read-only medium, and I'm very happy with that.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.960]   Jeff, do you cross-post all your tweets or just some?
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   Yes.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.040]   I stopped it for a while, but then I started it again.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.880]   I wish I had the chance when I posted any given tweet to decide.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.680]   You can do that with if this, then that...
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   That's what I've done with the bother.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.560]   Also with this, Aaron Nukem, we'll have a little something more down your alley.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.280]   We're going to talk about the Google Pixel phone in a bit.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.280]   And I guess...
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.280]   Ooh.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   Ooh.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   Because Jeff has to decide.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   He's got his at home.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.640]   Should he send it back before he opens the box?
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   Or should he...
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.120]   Oh, so Washington, send it to me.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.360]   That's Matthew Ingram from Fortune.com.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.400]   I showed it a brought to you by Blue Apron.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:29.320]   If you are sitting here and you're at work and you're thinking, "Oh, you know, what am
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.400]   I going to have for dinner?"
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   I have...
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.560]   This conversation is so common to me.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.160]   Lisa, my wife will say, "Okay, what are we having for dinner?"
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.000]   And then I'll say, "Oh, let me think.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Okay.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.360]   Oh, now I got to go shopping."
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.320]   And then by the time you're done, you say, "Can we just go to the Mexican and go have
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.440]   Mexican or Applebee's or..."
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.800]   And half the time we do, that's not good for us.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.360]   It's not good for our pocketbook.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.120]   Fortunately, there's Blue Apron, which is fantastic on Blue Apron nights.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.320]   I know what I'm going to cook.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.320]   I'm going to come home.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.240]   There's going to be a refrigerated box on my doorstep with three different meals, all
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.440]   the ingredients for each of them, including a recipe card that tells me exactly how to
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   make it.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.880]   And 45 minutes later, without any shopping, I will have the house will be filled with
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.480]   beautiful aromas and I will have an amazing meal.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.680]   Either for a couple, actually if you're a single, it's great.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.680]   You get two meals, right?
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.720]   You get dinner and tomorrow night too.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.360]   Or for a family, they have family plans with more ingredients and family, kid-friendly
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.720]   ingredients too.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:28.720]   And what a great way.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.240]   Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everybody while
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.640]   supporting a sustainable food system, setting the highest standards for ingredients and
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.720]   building a community of home chefs.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.440]   Seafood is sourced sustainably, always fresh in that refrigerated box.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.800]   Beef, also fresh, raised humanely chickens, free-range pork, raised naturally, regenerative
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.600]   farming practices.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.920]   And you never get more than you need.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.360]   You always get, if you need one eggplant, you get one eggplant, you need one clove of
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.600]   garlic, you get that.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.200]   I love the little bottles sometimes I get of sesame oil or soy.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.880]   It's wonderful.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.080]   They reduce food waste.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:07.160]   You cook exactly what you want and you've got an amazing meal with ingredients that
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.440]   you may never have tried before.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.400]   And then after that, you now know how to cook that meal.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.400]   They don't repeat.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.280]   You got at least a year between recipes.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.760]   So go right now to Blue Apron.com.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.240]   Pick a few recipes from this week like crispy chicken Milanese with warm Brussels sprouts,
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.560]   celery, potato salad or Thai, green, curry, chicken and squash.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.800]   With U-Choy, Jasmine, Rice and Cashews.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.280]   Oh, I'm going to get this one.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:36.040]   Roasted pork steamed mugs with black garlic mayonnaise and spicy cabbage slaw, seared salmon
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.960]   and fall vegetable hash with apple brown butter dressing.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.440]   Pick three.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.240]   Your first three meals are free with free shipping.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.280]   By the way, Blue Apron delivers to 99% of the cotton-l U.S.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.120]   Go to Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.000]   You'll love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home cooked meals.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Keep for your kids too.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.200]   The research shows that Blue Apron families cook three times more often together.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.440]   This is what you want.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.120]   Not just family dinner, but family cooking.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.960]   Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:14.040]   Thank you, Blue Apron, for all that you're doing for your support of our show.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.600]   I almost don't want to end the conversation.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   I have a feeling we'll be talking a lot more about 18-teatime warner and the changing landscape.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.880]   In fact, it's going to be probably the kind of a thematic part of the show for years to
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:34.160]   come as we watch this transition from broadcast to over-the-top programming.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.120]   Anything more you want to say before I do move on?
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.920]   Any other thoughts?
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:44.360]   Let's talk about some hardware.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.200]   I have put in my reservation.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.360]   You can't order it yet for the Jamboard.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.960]   I'm pretty excited about this.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.560]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.960]   This is a really weird product from Google.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:04.400]   It's a 4K display that ties into your mobile devices.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:10.520]   It's a portable whiteboard with touch and drawing.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.480]   You can collaborate, but you don't have to be all in the same place.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   Could I just happen anywhere?
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   Let me turn this.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   But the really great ones?
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   Down a little bit.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   Those need room to grow.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.480]   Meet Jamboard.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.840]   It almost feels like a concept product.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.080]   They aren't selling it yet.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   It's 55 inches.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.080]   Sketch.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   Drop image.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.560]   Microsoft is something very similar with Windows 10.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.880]   Pull things directly from the world.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.880]   This is more googly.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.920]   It feels more friendly and you don't really see an operating system around it.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.320]   I presume it's a Chromebook inside.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.320]   No margins.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.320]   No rules.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.760]   Jamboard is designed for the way you think.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.960]   The way you work.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.960]   I feel like this is awesome.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.960]   I have a performance from the internet.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   Is it just me?
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   It's just me.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.680]   Bringing your team together to unlock their creativity.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.600]   It also has a camera on it.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   It starts here.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   With a brief.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.920]   Paying along to the conferencing system you already have in many board rooms and conference
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   rooms.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   I would put this in our conference room.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.560]   It's got a little eraser.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   No batteries.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   No charging.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.720]   Capture the finest details even when you're working on the big picture.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.080]   Looks like it has handwriting recognition.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.400]   Jamboard was born to move.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.920]   An intuitive plug and play design that's ready to go.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   One cord.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.160]   No matter where your inspiration is.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.080]   The plug's into the wall.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.480]   Any place?
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   Any time?
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.040]   This is a new kind of teamwork.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.640]   An experience that lets every contributor share.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   Must use Jeff.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.200]   You do a lot of these brainstorming meetings.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   It's my creation.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   Things in corporate world.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.200]   You're a way of expression.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.720]   You must use these things, right?
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.560]   We imagined for the way you work today.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   I'm trying to talk.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.560]   I'm not cutting these out.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.160]   Oh, I'm probably gating you.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.720]   Yeah, I tried to.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   Alright.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.080]   I was wondering why I got so quiet.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   I mean, mute the set.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.360]   You enjoyed it, didn't you, Leo?
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.360]   It was actually right.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   I enjoyed the piece.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   The piece of clothing.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.360]   Beautiful.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.800]   By the way, I was seeing $6,000 or under six.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.160]   It's just like a niche product, doesn't it?
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.120]   I set this to my colleagues at CUNY.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.640]   We want them for our classrooms now.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.160]   Classroom, boardroom, conference room.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.600]   Yeah, I would have kept that in my office.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.920]   Yeah, especially since it does hangouts as well.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:19.640]   I mean, since it's a computer, it's built in.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.440]   You don't have to worry about adding another.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.440]   I don't know if you've had this experience, Jeff.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.320]   I know I have at work trying to do Google Hangouts from your thing, and then you're doing video
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.560]   conference, and then someone else wants to start a WebEx, and it's all confusing.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.360]   Having all of that stuff, the whiteboard and everything built right into one platform,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.600]   I think, is huge for schools and for business users as well.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.480]   Cross-platform, it's Android and iOS.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.760]   You can have two Jamboards and two locations and collaborate together that way.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.000]   I don't know.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.840]   I mean, it's not going to be a massive product for Google.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.360]   Microsoft has been trying to make something like this.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.000]   They bought a company that makes this thing, and I don't think they've yet to sell it.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.920]   I think that it's much, much more.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.080]   It's twice as expensive at least.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   And one of the Korean manufacturers had it too.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.280]   I forget who's Amazon or LG?
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.800]   Well, we've seen digital whiteboards before.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.080]   I've seen them for years.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.680]   First half of 2017, and it's specifically for G Suite customers.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   I just don't know how many schools are going to be able to buy those things for 6 grand
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   to eat.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   They're expensive.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.880]   But schools buy projectors.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.200]   They buy PowerPoint projectors.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   They...
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.200]   True.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   You're right.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.360]   And I think it's one of the reasons they emphasize mobility.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.800]   You don't need to buy more than one.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   You can roll it around.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.400]   Kids class had to bring in an old computer because they couldn't afford to get anyone.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.320]   Yeah, no, I believe me.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.400]   I'm in California.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.520]   You know, there's no money for schools in California.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.360]   All right.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.440]   Other hardware.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.920]   The pixels here.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.600]   Extremely short supply.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:02.280]   In fact, Google just announced that it's going to be later in November even.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.040]   Some people who apparently, some people have ordered pixels and were told earlier delivery
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.480]   dates are going to be pushed back.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.080]   Did they underestimate, do you think?
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   Or is that or they have a hardware problem?
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.640]   They have a manufacturer issue.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   It's hard to say.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.640]   Verizon has them.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.360]   In fact, the reason I have a pixel, mine doesn't come until November 8th through 10th,
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.520]   according to the reason I have a pixel is I sent cars to Verizon and they had them.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.760]   He just went and walked in and bought one.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   So I've been able to play with it.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.640]   And Jeff, you did order yours immediately at the event, right?
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.640]   You're getting it.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   I came out to the cars.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.040]   I was driving to the airport or were going to work for the airport.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.520]   Did you want this box?
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.040]   Oh my God.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   I was going to bring it and I thought, no, customs could be a lot of fun.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.520]   I was going to unbox it here in Germany.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.640]   I thought that this will confuse the heck out of people.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   So I left it at home.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   That's a very good point.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.320]   What do you think of it, Leo?
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.200]   Google's charging too much for it.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.280]   It's the same price as an iPhone.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   Exactly.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.600]   Point for point.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.360]   And of course, we just saw the bill of materials.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:12.840]   I don't know how accurate those are from the supply chain folks, but I supply.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.600]   But the bill of materials is I think was 285 bucks.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:22.360]   It's a little bit lower than Apple, but it's not low enough that probably could be a lot
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.520]   less expensive.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.800]   The problem is the fit and finish look and feel are secondary really to something like
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   the iPhone 7.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:33.840]   If I gave you an iPhone 7 plus and a Google Pixel XL to hold in your hand, I've done this
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.920]   a few times.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   We just didn't know.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.720]   Well, this was much, much, much nicer.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.760]   The iPhone camera is as good.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.000]   Actually, it's a funny way to say it because usually you say it the other way around.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.280]   Well, the Pixel camera is almost as good as the iPhone camera.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.160]   Actually, it's better than the iPhone camera, but it's missing two things that are really
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.600]   important, optical image stabilization.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.880]   The iPhone camera has two lenses and those of us who've used it now are hooked on it.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.200]   Not the only phone that does that.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.760]   The LG's been doing it and others, the B20 doesn't.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.440]   I think the G5 did it.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:14.040]   It's really useful to have a second zooming lens, but where this really beats Apple and
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.360]   everybody else, everybody else, including Amazon, including Microsoft is the Google Assistant
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.920]   is phenomenal.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:23.920]   Give me a task.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.920]   I'll give you.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.320]   Actually, I'll do one right now because I'm flying out.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   What time is my flight tonight?
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.920]   Hmm, I don't recall.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.760]   Well, that's useless.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   Thanks.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.000]   I can do that.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.360]   When am I flying to Gainesville?
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:50.760]   Delta Airlines flight 1,960 from San Francisco to Atlanta leaves at 10.30 p.m. today.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:56.720]   Where are some good places to eat there?
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.200]   I found a few places.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.680]   So these are Gainesville restaurants.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.840]   So it remembers context.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.000]   Yeah, so it remembers what you asked just before.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Siri doesn't do that.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   I don't think.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.440]   Make me a reservation at Embers.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:13.920]   Sorry, I don't know how to do that yet.
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.600]   So that's one limitation.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.920]   It has to be on open table.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.800]   So I don't know which ones of these.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   Well, that's a problem.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   The reservation.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   The reservation.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   The reservation.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   Reservation.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   Reservation.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.800]   Reservation.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.880]   Yeah, you know, I can hear I'll do it.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   I'll do a restaurant.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.840]   We know that does do this.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.600]   Make me a reservation for Central Market.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.800]   Here's a result from Search.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.900]   Oh, wow.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.900]   You're not doing well.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.800]   But if you ask, we're reservation tonight at Central Market.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.000]   Here's the top search result.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.080]   So it's saying I have bad internet connectivity.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.880]   So maybe that's what's going on with this.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:59.400]   In the past, it's done very well.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.960]   It would walk me through it, make the reservation.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.520]   It's assistant.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.840]   It's for some reason.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.440]   I probably should restart the phone.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.840]   It's probably the Wi-Fi.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.960]   But it's very, very good.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:14.080]   And what's also notable, it's dictation is almost perfect.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.440]   Even in noisy environments, it's been very--
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   And it is only for the Pixel.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.440]   The Assistant.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.440]   And Aloe.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.240]   And the Google Home, but it will not be available, at least
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.960]   now, on any other Android device.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.280]   That's right.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.080]   Which I find interesting.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.840]   That's irritating.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.680]   But maybe they made the decision that they
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.840]   need the extra horsepower in that phone.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.120]   And they want to make it more exclusive too, right?
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.720]   So they can justify you paying that much for it.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:51.760]   Or maybe also that the servers, they don't want to--
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.280]   this is a challenging thing to do.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.280]   They want to make sure--
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.560]   You don't want them to experience crumble.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.240]   There's a lot of reasons that they could--
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.560]   And we've discussed this over the last few shows.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.960]   And I think we kind of agree that eventually Google
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.120]   will push this out to other Android devices.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.360]   Yeah, they have to.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.000]   They've got to.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.280]   I mean, I'm assuming this is going to run on Google Home,
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.800]   and that can't be as powerful as--
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.200]   It is running on Google Home.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.520]   So it's not really a horsepower thing.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.920]   Yeah, the work that goes on is going back at Cloud.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.920]   It's not happening.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:25.800]   It's a gaming.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.400]   Exactly.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.880]   And we've often talked about really the main thing Google
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.360]   announced on October 4th was not the hardware,
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.880]   but the fact that they're going to put a system everywhere.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.360]   This kind of universal assistant is the future for Google.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.880]   Let me try.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.320]   What was it?
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.000]   OK.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.760]   Somebody in the chat room suggested.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.480]   What are the reviews for Dr. Strange?
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:54.840]   You know, this is-- something's really--
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.520]   it gave me a look up.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.360]   You know, I wonder if this might be server-side.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.800]   So this is much, much, much better than it's behaving right
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.640]   now.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.560]   So that was the biggest thing.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.680]   It's not a bad phone.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.880]   I mean, it's not poorly made.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.120]   The screen is very fast.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.360]   Well, before we went on the ear--
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.560]   Leo, before we went on the ear, you said, oh, Jeff,
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.640]   you're going to love this phone.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.560]   You're not going to set it back.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.000]   And now, now I'm hearing.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.240]   In comparison to something you don't want, which
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.920]   is an iPhone 7, the hardware is not as nicely done.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.360]   There's features of the iPhone 7 I miss.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.280]   But compared to other Android phones,
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.160]   there's no question this is the Android phone you want.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:35.840]   The best.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:41.200]   Battery life is very good, not great, not perfect,
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.520]   but pretty good.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.360]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.760]   I was hoping for better.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.080]   I'm getting the smaller one.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.440]   This one, Carson's going to get to keep this one when
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.480]   my smaller one comes November 8.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.400]   And I don't know what the battery life will be like on that one.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.720]   Now, here's your question, Jeff.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:00.400]   Should I get rid of my 6P and replace it with this?
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.120]   And I don't know.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.640]   I mean, frankly, I don't know if it's that much better
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.120]   than the 6P.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.320]   That's what I'm--
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.160]   Imagine a 6P with the assistant, basically.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:11.720]   And by the way, the camera is fantastic.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.120]   Very, very good camera.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:13.640]   I mean--
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.400]   Let's be honest.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.440]   If I weren't doing this show, you wouldn't.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.720]   And I probably wouldn't do it.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:20.160]   No.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:20.560]   Now you wouldn't.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:25.120]   I'm tempted by the camera and Google Assistant, I have to say.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:27.240]   I'm not buying it until the price comes down.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.480]   And I'm a huge Android fan.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.240]   And it's outrageously expensive.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.120]   It's jaw-droppingly expensive.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.840]   And I'm really surprised that they did that.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.480]   I mean, if you compare it to something like--
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.120]   I posted this on Google+ and Facebook and all the rest--
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.920]   the Honor 6X, which is--
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:43.880]   I don't want to call it low-end.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.680]   It's got high-end specs, but I'm sure it's
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:50.240]   going to be a cheap phone, let's just say, cheaply made.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.920]   But it's a really nice phone--
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.360]   or really nice specs on it.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:57.200]   And it's like 230 bucks.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.520]   5.5 inch phone.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.440]   It does dual SIM.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.720]   It does external SD cards, 4 giga-ram.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.680]   And then you can go all the way up to 128 giga-storage.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.040]   I mean, it's got all the features.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.360]   And I know it doesn't have the fit and finish like people want.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:15.200]   But you can get it for-- well, assuming, at least in China,
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.440]   the high-end phone is going to be $230.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   Who knows what it will be if it ever comes to the US?
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.120]   But it's just like, man, if Google
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:28.600]   would have made this, the Pixel phone, $4.99 or even $5.99
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.120]   maybe, I think they would have sold a lot more.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:31.640]   Now, who knows?
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.760]   Time will tell whether they do sell a lot of them.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.880]   Maybe time will prove me wrong.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.560]   I don't know.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.560]   I mean, there's very good--
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:39.160]   Why did they go so high?
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:39.960]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.200]   What does the rationale?
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:47.040]   I personally think that they are trying to compete with Apple.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.400]   And they think perception is that if you're
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.440]   charging a lot of money, that puts you as a scenario.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.240]   It's a terrible way to compete.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.560]   We're going to compete by being equally--
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.840]   Well, Jack's our price, though.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   Even though the quality's not--
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.600]   And by the way, it's not waterproof.
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.720]   It's not waterproof.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.340]   The speakers, they replaced what was really a nice speaker
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.200]   set up on the 6P with speakers on the bottom that
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.360]   are easily covered by your finger.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:14.480]   And you mentioned the Xiaomi Honor,
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.440]   but also-- don't forget, Huawei, which built the 6P,
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.520]   has a very good choice, the Axon 7, which is essentially a 6P.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.000]   The story, Rana Mario had this in ours,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.360]   Technica, is that Huawei was tapped to build this phone.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.720]   But the turnaround time--
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.280]   what was it?
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.800]   They ended up being HCC building it,
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.520]   and they had to build it in nine months.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.960]   And so they literally didn't have time to make it waterproof.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.280]   And I have to say, that's credible.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.040]   That's credible.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.200]   So I think, aside from a very good camera, which, frankly,
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.920]   these days is kind of table stakes for a high-end smartphone,
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:00.360]   the only real differentiator is the assistant.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.600]   By the Pixel launcher, I should show you that,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.640]   because that's the new launcher.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.400]   You can download that, can't you?
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:06.880]   Or not.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.080]   Maybe you have to have a Pixel to use a Pixel launcher.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   I'm not really a fan, but it does have one new feature
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.800]   that I think could be good.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.840]   It's something that they cribbed from the iPhone.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.520]   On the iPhone, if you 3D touch an icon,
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.720]   you can get a menu of possible actions.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.520]   And on this, if you long touch an item, it has to be--
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.040]   right now, it's almost only Google,
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.440]   and not everything for Google.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.520]   You'll get a little pop-up menu.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.680]   For instance, if I long touch the camera,
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.520]   I'll get a pop-up menu that gives me a choice of take a video
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.440]   or take a selfie.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.720]   If I long touch my phone icon, I'll get most commonly called
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.280]   contacts, or I can create a new contact.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.040]   The problem with that is that there's very few icons.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.120]   And this was the same with Apple in the early days of 3D touch.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.360]   There are very few icons that support it.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.480]   But the behavior when it doesn't support it,
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.080]   and even some Google-- here's Google+,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.240]   is that when you long touch it, it puts it in the move icon,
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:12.200]   create a new screen mode, which is really bad.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.800]   That is not-- I mean, that's terrible.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.480]   You swipe right.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.960]   You do get the Google now, as with Google Now launcher.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.160]   This, you can't change. There's a widget at the top that
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.840]   is essentially just Google branding.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.920]   There's the Google G. When you tap that,
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:32.760]   all it is is the Chrome search bar with some previous Chrome
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.280]   searches.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.720]   It's not particularly useful.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.880]   And on the right, you get temperature and weather widget.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.280]   And these are not removable.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.600]   So come to think of it, Jeff.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.080]   Send it back.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.560]   Chat room says you can, sideload, pixel launcher.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.360]   Yeah, you can get the APK for it.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.440]   I like Nova launcher, but Nova launcher doesn't do that long
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.240]   press thing yet.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.440]   So--
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440]   No vlogger.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.200]   No vlogger.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.640]   On a whole-- if I play with a system on a home,
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.920]   that'll give me some sense of it.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.280]   By the way, just saw in Twitter, who was it,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.600]   who did this for us, Steven Sandoff,
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.680]   said that Google has renamed cat Google cast Google home.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680]   Yes.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.320]   If you have Google cast on your--
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.520]   The confusing.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.020]   Yep.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.080]   If you have Google cast on your--
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.160]   You're going to have a hardware item called home that
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.040]   has nothing to do with the application called home.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.160]   Anyway, but I'll have the hardware item called home, which
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.560]   I want to play with.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.680]   And that will give me a sense of a sense of it.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.360]   Yes.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.600]   And Alo does, too.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.920]   Alo is assistant.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.720]   That's the other thing.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.920]   And I'm really mad at Google.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.680]   They're messaging--
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.440]   It's terrible.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   Stories is just awful.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.040]   So you're supposed to use Google--
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.760]   the messages app on this phone.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.400]   That's the default messaging.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.960]   Hangouts-- I know-- it's still around.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.040]   I like Hangouts, but it's still around.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.360]   But they're deprecating it, right?
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.200]   I guess.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.800]   And then Alo does not take SMS messages,
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.000]   so it can't be used as your SMS messenger.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.760]   It's crazy.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.480]   That's what it should be across the board.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.400]   Alo should be your SMS messenger.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.280]   They've really bunged that up.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.120]   So you know what, Jeff, send it back.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.240]   I changed my mind.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.920]   I'm now getting more and more angry.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.960]   The 6P is a nice phone.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.480]   It is.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:20.980]   It is.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.880]   And that life isn't better than the 6P.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.040]   It's the same as the 6P, basically.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.080]   The 6P is going to go down in price now
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.120]   that the Pixel phones are out.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.480]   So it should be a bargain.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.120]   Because I'm not--
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.080]   Because I'm not fine.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.960]   I think having fine, especially as you travel,
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.760]   as much as you do, is great.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   I have that on the 6P.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.040]   The 6P, if you're on the beta program,
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.280]   you've got 7-1 now.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.240]   I got it a couple of nights ago.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:50.480]   Google is becoming a frustrating company.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:56.520]   I will say, I tried just today to describe Google's messaging,
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.680]   like platforms and features and services
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.640]   to a normal person, a mortal who doesn't read about this stuff
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.160]   all the time.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.520]   And I failed.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.920]   And I don't think that was me.
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.480]   I think they'd--
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:08.840]   No.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.560]   Eventually, this look came over their face, like, give up.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.120]   Like, this is just way too complicated.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:21.800]   We talked about it yesterday on security now.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.800]   It's hammer time.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.800]   The row hammer, which is an exploit
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.440]   that takes advantage of flaws in memory that
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:35.240]   allows a bad guy to get root access remotely to your phone,
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.480]   is a problem on many Android devices.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.120]   There is a proof of concept that's
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.720]   out to the newest version of a row hammer, which
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.160]   affects modern Android devices.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.720]   The good news is, as far as I can tell,
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.440]   I tried the tester on here at Crash.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.640]   But as far as I can tell, this is one advantage, the Pixel,
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.880]   because it uses DDR4, I think, is immune to the row hammer
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.920]   attack.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.000]   However, that's the other reason why you really
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.600]   want a Google phone is security.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   They're the only phones that would be kept up to date.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.720]   The problem with row hammer attack
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.640]   is it's a hardware attack and is not easily mitigated,
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.400]   if mitigated at all, in software.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.520]   So there's no update.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.440]   So you just have to hope that you have hardware that's
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.240]   incompatible.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:26.440]   And of course, all the older Android devices
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.000]   are vulnerable.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.320]   Watch the show security now if you
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.720]   want to know more details, because it's
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.720]   pretty technical.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:44.520]   Is it true that they put the Google address on the SIM card
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.800]   holder?
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.400]   They what?
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.720]   They put the Google physical address on the rundown.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.440]   What?
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:51.960]   Is it?
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.840]   Why did they do that?
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.920]   Take out the SIM card.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.640]   Take out the SIM tray.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.840]   And the--
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.280]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.200]   What is the purpose of that?
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.320]   It seems like the street address.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.480]   Yeah, they put the street address of the Google headquarters.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.880]   Wow.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.800]   OK.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.600]   On the SIM card.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.800]   So if I lose it, would they mail it back to Google?
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.840]   Yeah, I really--
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.760]   I have no idea why.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.120]   They're taken it back.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.680]   They're personally.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.240]   Let me-- here's a--
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.720]   John's just brought me a SIM hopper.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.760]   Oh, I hope I'm not sticking it in the microphone hole.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.080]   I hate it when I do that.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.720]   Well, I could say something, but I won't.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.120]   Uh, it's, uh, yeah.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.440]   1600 amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, California, 94043.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.040]   I didn't notice that.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.080]   Return to sender.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.080]   Why would you take that?
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.040]   So I go back and forth on this.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:50.480]   I agree.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.360]   Why would you do that?
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.520]   But at the same time, it's kind of cool, too.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.600]   You know, it goes back to the days when people used to sign
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.320]   their name on the PCB on the inside of your Commodore 64
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.760]   or something.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.480]   You know, I think that's--
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:04.880]   I don't know.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.760]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.320]   But at the same time, it's an Easter egg,
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.880]   and it's like, yeah, why?
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.360]   I don't know.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.320]   Maybe put something else there, but it is kind of cool.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.000]   You know, they got-- this is the first phone with Google
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.480]   branding on the phone, right?
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.680]   And that was, by the way, why Huawei did not
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.600]   want to participate with--
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.200]   in the Pixel program, because they wanted Huawei branding.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.400]   So they bowed out.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.320]   That's why HTC came in at the last minute.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.280]   They could have said, you have too much money.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.960]   You schmuck, but they didn't.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:35.360]   I don't know, Jeff.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.240]   I hate to say don't get it.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.120]   But basically--
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.000]   It's a lot of money.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.960]   It's a lot of money.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.240]   It's way too much money.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.960]   Basically, my two phones are going to be the Pixel
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.720]   and the iPhone 7.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.040]   And neither is perfect.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.800]   I've yet to see the perfect phone.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.800]   [AUDIO OUT]
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.600]   Let me ask you.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.360]   So as the Pixel is to a tablet, the Pixel C is to a tablet.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.880]   The Pixel phone is to a phone.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.000]   Which one is a leap above?
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.760]   Pixel C is so disappointing, too.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.200]   I love that tablet, but the hardware I love.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.160]   But it's not a particularly useful tablet.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160]   But I use it now.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.000]   It's what I use.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.400]   Yeah, I like the phone.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.360]   I like the form factor.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.040]   I like the hardware an awful lot.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:27.560]   The crap.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.320]   They never modified Android in a way that made it as useful
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.080]   as it can be.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:38.760]   I think that a lot of this is Google realizing
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.920]   that the differentiation is in software now.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.920]   We're not seeing the type of advancements
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.760]   in the hardware anymore.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.000]   And so I was thinking about this over the past few days.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.840]   And I was thinking about how the Pixel and how bummed
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.440]   I was over the price.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.320]   But I think that now the advantage is I'm
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.800]   going to get a Pixel because there's this software feature
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.160]   I really want.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   And I can only get it on the Pixel phone.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.000]   I can't get it on other Android phones.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.600]   And that's a weird thing Apple.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.000]   It's really for Google to do.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:09.880]   It's very weird.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.240]   Very uncougulating their dissatisfaction
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.760]   with the Android ecosystem that they've
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.600]   lost control of it, right?
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.840]   Which is a real problem.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.040]   That's no good.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.320]   Maybe this is your next phone.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.240]   The Xiaomi Mi Mix, the bezel-less phone
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.280]   that's only available in China, although Marcus Brownlee
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.800]   and others have been showing it off.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.000]   It is a concept smartphone that you can buy.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.080]   91.3% screen to body ratio.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.160]   Very, very little bezel.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.240]   It's big, 6.4 inches.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.160]   This is bigger than the Nexus 6.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.240]   And frankly, I don't know--
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.920]   I know everybody's crazy about this, but where do you hold it?
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.400]   I know.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.360]   When I have to hand my phone to the airline employee
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.400]   to put on the thing, that they're
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.360]   so delicate with it, that I don't want to hit anything.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.800]   I like a little bezel.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.760]   Little bezel-less.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.560]   By the way, what's interesting about this is $516.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.520]   With an 821, the latest Snapdragon, 4 gigs of RAM,
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.240]   128 gigs of storage, 16 megapixel camera,
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.440]   and a massive 4,400 milliamp hour battery.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.360]   Wow.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:26.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.120]   Wow.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.440]   That's $516.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:28.880]   What did I say?
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.160]   $516.
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.800]   It's much less.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.240]   Much less than the--
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.040]   How big is the battery in your new phone?
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.080]   $30.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.440]   What is it?
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   $3,500?
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.240]   Is it, I think?
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.520]   Wow.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.400]   Wow.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.560]   And there's an 18-carat version with a 14-carat gold
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.760]   around the camera and fingerprint sensor.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.080]   That is going to be $590.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.680]   It's still less.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.680]   And that one has 6 gig of RAM and 256 gig of storage.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.120]   So that's what I'm talking about.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:00.840]   Like if you're--
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.520]   It doesn't have--
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.680]   But it doesn't have Google Assistant.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.560]   Google.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.240]   How much is the Google Assistant worth to you?
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.320]   I think, Jeff, you're right.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.160]   Keep the 6P and you've got the Google Home.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.080]   You can play with the Assistant.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.840]   Wow.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.040]   Wow.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.520]   That's a nice phone.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.760]   Do you-- but I want to-- I need a little bezel.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.400]   That's another complaint about the pixel
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.320]   is the big bezel at the bottom.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.240]   They could be disabling the touch sensor just
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.000]   around the edges, like just a couple millimeters
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.680]   or a millimeter around the edge to make sure
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.080]   that you don't accidentally trigger it.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.320]   Another good thing, I have to say,
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.680]   the wallpapers on the Google Pixel are great.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.440]   There's a live earth wallpaper that
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:51.160]   shows current cloud cover and the current date terminator.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.760]   A bet it kills your battery, though.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.920]   Yeah, maybe that's why I'm in battery sucks.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.200]   Doesn't suck.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.320]   Doesn't suck.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.840]   Marcus Brownlee apparently in his review
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.280]   said they are ignoring edge touches.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.760]   I just don't want to touch the edge.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.360]   And I like the Note 7 edge and the Galaxy S7 edge, which
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.720]   did have edge to edge on the left and right.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.040]   So--
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   Mm-hmm.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.040]   All right.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.560]   Facebook, most secure for instant messaging services.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.760]   That's kind of a surprise, but that's
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.920]   according to Amnesty International, which
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.360]   has an interest in this because, of course,
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.320]   they want to make sure dissidents do not get in trouble.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.880]   So security is very important.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.760]   Amnesty International ranked all of the services.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.800]   Apple came in second with iMessage and FaceTime.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.000]   Skype, Snapchat, way down the list.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.400]   And there won't be any privacy in the future,
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.120]   according to Joe Westby, who is a technology researcher
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.440]   for Amnesty International.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:56.800]   So using their messaging app is a great idea,
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.080]   but don't post your stuff actually on Facebook.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:00.960]   Yeah, well, I think that's--
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.560]   --the delete it.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.040]   Speaking of which, did you see that AT&T
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.800]   has actually a little business, a little side business,
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.080]   giving your information to the feds?
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.840]   They've been doing that for a while.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.440]   They've always been cooperative.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.320]   Very lucrative.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.280]   And we knew that--
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.480]   So I went to a session today at the Sudhooch and Zaiton,
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.840]   where Dan Giltmore interviewed Edward Snowden--
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840]   Ooh.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.640]   --for a journalist to Kakathon that was there.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.400]   So it was a small group.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.400]   So it was really, really--
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.120]   By a Skype.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.440]   Of course.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.360]   Well, Google, I think--
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:37.880]   Hang out.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.480]   --by Hangout.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.880]   You can use it on YouTube to all watch it.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.680]   But that was his first soliloquy, was about how basically
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.440]   the government had to come to the phone company to get
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.800]   stuff and the phone company find turn around,
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.400]   so what do I make?
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.000]   It's a business.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.520]   OK.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.000]   You know?
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:53.520]   Great idea.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.520]   Here's what--
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.800]   Capitalism at work.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.720]   And AT&T denies, you know, oh, we did--
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.880]   it's just-- we got some dedicated employees.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.560]   But according to the Daily Beast--
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.680]   by the way, you always know that it's a profit center when
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.880]   they give it a brand name.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.040]   It's called Hemisphere.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.080]   North, South, and East and West.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.640]   It's too bad they didn't use one of those cool CIA co-games
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.960]   that are dog catcher or--
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   Wind shark.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.360]   So obviously, we know that telecommunications companies
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.520]   have to hand over records.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.520]   They're often asked for this, and they don't have much right
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:35.760]   to say no.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.520]   But according to Chris Segoian, who's
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.480]   analyst at the ACLU and a really great security guy,
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.680]   AT&T doesn't have to data-mine its database to help police
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.520]   come up with new numbers to investigate.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.400]   They're actually going well beyond what law enforcement
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.480]   is asking for.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.000]   And because AT&T has so much metadata,
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.120]   they don't give the law enforcement the access to it,
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.240]   but they'll analyze it for it.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.320]   They'll mine it for law enforcement.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.480]   AT&T has three quarters of US landline switches,
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.680]   just behind Verizon.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:12.360]   And it has cell tower data going back to July 2008,
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.080]   longer than anyone else.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.040]   Verizon holds records for a year sprint for 18 months.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.080]   And remember, AT&T was one of the very first--
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.560]   I forget the name of the program, but decades ago.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.720]   Echelon.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.000]   Was it Echelon set up effectively access
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.200]   to their entire backbone?
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.760]   We know, because a whistleblower talked about how AT&T had
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.920]   let the NSA put a bug in its San Francisco.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.400]   Yeah, he set the whole point.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.400]   Analysis is done by AT&T employees
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.920]   on behalf of law enforcement clients
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.640]   through these AT&T intelligence centers,
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.120]   20 of them across the country.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.920]   They're staffed not just by AT&T,
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:59.240]   but by federal agents and local law enforcement.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.040]   Super.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:00.840]   Nice.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.360]   And oh, you'll love this.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.120]   When they send the statement of work to law enforcement,
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.400]   the government agency has to agree not to use the data
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.560]   as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings,
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.880]   unless there's no other available
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.560]   and amissable probative evidence,
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.560]   because they don't want anybody to know this is happening.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.000]   Mm.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.560]   Nice.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.880]   There's a non-disclosure agreement.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:26.400]   First, like a great business.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.880]   He's a little lazy.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.560]   Adam Schwartz, who's an activist, a staff attorney for EFF,
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.440]   says, "The first time I've seen an AT&T document
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.000]   "which requires parallel construction and a service
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.240]   "to governments, very troubling,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.800]   "and not the way law enforcement should work in this country."
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:46.680]   Of course, the federal government reimburses the municipalities
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:52.000]   for hemisphere, and that money goes into AT&T's pocket.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.920]   And it's warrantless.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.520]   Did I mention there's no warrant?
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.760]   I mentioned that.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.960]   They just say, yeah, about it.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.600]   Save time.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.920]   We don't need a warrant.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.320]   Whatever.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.160]   What do you want?
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.720]   Anything you want?
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.920]   Hey, Leo?
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.080]   Yes, sir.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.280]   I think I'm going to go collapse.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.560]   Are you tiring?
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:10.880]   All right.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.680]   I'm tired.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.320]   Let me quickly wrap it up with an--
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.280]   Oh, good.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.520]   Do a base camp, but we'll just wrap it up.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.200]   Why not?
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:18.720]   Yeah, OK.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.320]   Jessica, you've got to go do the German today show.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.960]   Our show today brought to you by Basecamp.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   And we know Basecamp.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.280]   You know David Heinemier-Hanson.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.640]   We've had him on triangulation.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.600]   His partner Jason Freed, they created 37 signals.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.440]   They've always been interested in making work more productive.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.760]   But more than no more productive, more friendly to workers,
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.920]   to you to make your work better.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.960]   They created Basecamp many years ago.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.920]   They've actually renamed the company a couple of years ago,
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.280]   Basecamp and the new Basecamp 3 just came out,
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.480]   and it is awesome.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.320]   Completely rewritten from the ground up.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.120]   It's a private, secure space online where teams can stay
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.120]   organized, can discuss what they need to get the job done.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.280]   Forget email for this.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.160]   Forget messaging.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.520]   It's all in one great tool message
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.480]   where it's file storage to do is chat, schedules, automatic
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.560]   check-ins.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.080]   The home screen-- there it is right there--
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.840]   provides a more visual approach because it's
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.560]   card-based.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.800]   Your projects are there.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.720]   Teams, company HQ.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.360]   That's the intranet.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.520]   That's Jason talking about it right there.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.600]   You can easily access your assignments, your bookmarks,
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.760]   your drafts using the My Stuff link on your homepage.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.840]   You have a homepage.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.880]   Set up teams to share ideas, ask questions,
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.320]   and collaborate on projects.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.400]   You can even brand your account with your logo.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.960]   So this really looks good.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.680]   Jason Freed is awesome.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:47.480]   We use it for our live events to manage all the events
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480]   from planning to execution.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.440]   Colleen loves it.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.600]   She says, it's easy to use.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.600]   It's a great way for all of us to stay in touch.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.240]   Know what we're doing, Kara, likes those email reminders.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.520]   Are you forgetful, Kara?
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.320]   And it's easy to assign tasks and keep
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:04.320]   track of how those tasks are being handled.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.160]   That's what we've been looking for for a long time.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.440]   The whole idea--
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.040]   I talked to Jason Freed for a long time.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.840]   I've interviewed both of them many times.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.840]   The whole idea is, as your business gets bigger,
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.120]   if it's five people, it's easy to keep track of what everybody's
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:15.620]   doing.
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.040]   But as it gets bigger-- and I think it's--
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.240]   for us, it was around 20 employees.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.560]   You need a better way to keep track of who's doing what.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.600]   Where they stand.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.280]   And this is the solution.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.760]   It's just a low-stress solution that gets the job done.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.520]   You know what I really like?
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.600]   Like I said, they're very humane.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.440]   Jason really thinks about how it feels to be the user, the
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.960]   employee that uses this.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.400]   You could set your work schedule in here, so you don't get
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:42.040]   notifications when you're not on at work.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.160]   So that you have your real-time off.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.040]   Basecamp is awesome.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.200]   You get a calmer, more productive workplace.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.800]   And I love the pricing.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.160]   They don't charge per seat.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.200]   It's a flat rate, very affordable for one seat to a 10,000
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.680]   seats.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.480]   It's incredible.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.880]   You can sign up today with a free trial.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.560]   Go to basecamp.com/twit.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.240]   You've probably heard of Basecamp.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.160]   You may even have tried it, but you've got to see the new
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.120]   Basecamp 3 free for 30 days.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.960]   Trust me, this is a huge and wonderful update.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.440]   Basecamp.com/twit.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.720]   Jeff Jarvis at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.560]   He's a sleepyhead.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.360]   Always a pleasure to have you on the show.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.760]   I really missed you last week.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.440]   We always miss you.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.120]   Yeah, sorry I wasn't there, but I thought that it would have
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.400]   been Wi-Fi at all.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.160]   Are you coming back?
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.520]   Will you be back next Wednesday?
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.040]   I'll be back this weekend, yeah.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:37.520]   Yep.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.600]   Look forward to seeing you back here.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.840]   Lots more to talk about.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.960]   We didn't really get to the DDoS or any of that stuff,
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.640]   but that's all right.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.880]   I'd like to have more for next week.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.000]   We did have a great conversation, I thought, on the
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.200]   time Warner thing.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.280]   And since a couple of you have been time Warner and
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.240]   Plus, it's kind of interesting to hear that.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240]   Show you the scars.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.040]   In fact, guess who's still there at fortune.com, but it's
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.280]   the spun off time ink.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.720]   Matthew Ingram is great to have you.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:06.200]   Matthew I on the Twitter.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:11.280]   One T in that Matthew in the correct Canadian fact.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.160]   Always a pleasure, thank you, Matthew.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.320]   Erin Newcomb, one of our favorite makers.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.520]   Don't forget the Benisha Maker Space.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.600]   You could follow him on Twitter @ Erin Newcomb or Google
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.720]   Plus Plus, Erin Newcomb.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.720]   I know we'll see you back here soon and all about
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.440]   Android or the new screensavers or whatever.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:27.880]   It's just--
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.520]   Plus weekly, too, right?
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.600]   Yeah, in fact, I was just on KnowHow, showing people how
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:37.320]   to build sprinkler irrigation system timer out of a
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.400]   Raspberry Pi Zero.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.440]   So you can go check that out.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:39.880]   Wow.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:43.200]   I just uploaded all the code for it to GitHub today, and it
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.960]   should be posted now.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.960]   If it's not, I'm sure Brian or somebody will be posting that
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.640]   in the show notes very soon.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.520]   Next week, I hope Stacy will be back next week because I want
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.640]   to talk-- she's, of course, our queen of internet of things.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.000]   She's got the internet of things podcast and website.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.160]   And she wrote a very good piece in Medium.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.840]   The internet of things is not trying to kill you.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.320]   You should read it.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.480]   No, I'm big sure to read it.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.080]   And we will talk about it next week in conjunction with this.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:08.760]   Can't wait.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:13.680]   DDoS, it'll be great to have you all back in studio with us.
