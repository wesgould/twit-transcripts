[00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:04.120]   It's time for twig this week in Google show we covered the Google verse but the cloud
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:12.000]   We covered journalism we cover anything we darn well, please pretty much we've got Jeff Jarvis between Jeff and me
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   We're cranky enough for everybody
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   Buzz machine comms his blog his books are many including public parts
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   What would Google do and Gutenberg the geek and be where geek sparing gifts and all of that actually just geek sparing gifts?
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.960]   That's the list yes, you don't have to beware of them. Yeah
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.120]   It's good to see you again, Jeff good to see you
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.760]   You look on my mat well cuz that's because our office flooded what
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.360]   Brilliant building turned off on the holiday weekend very very critical horrible cold time
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   They decided to turn off the heat on the sixth floor, which is too force above us
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   And it went the snow melt and come in the window what happened no the
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.080]   Fire extinguisher pipe burst out good Lord. Oh, it froze. They've torn up by office
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.640]   I have to home. I'm whining. I'm complaining
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.080]   Here you just stay home just stay in here. I'm home. I'm on the new Mac. You sent me on the new microphone
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.480]   Look at that. You sound great. You look great. You are great. I'm not pink
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.440]   Kevin Tofel's also joining us from giga
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:27.680]   Howdy howdy I am not cranky we were just talking about the Beatles before the show and how can you be cranky happy now the Beatles absolutely
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.200]   I noticed that he has John Paul George and Ringo on
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.800]   The wall behind him and what's interesting those are originals those are
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.600]   That's pretty cool. You know what those were from Kickstarter in fact the there was a DVD documentary on
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.200]   Roland Sherman the photographer who took those and I got those as part of the Kickstarter nice
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.000]   This man is so serious. He went out and bought a turntable
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.520]   So he can play the original capital 45s. I
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.360]   Do have actually the a first pressing from the UK of help sitting over by the turn you're not gonna put a needle on that
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   I am I have not yet
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.840]   Honestly, I have it's like opening an 80 year old or 30 year old bottle of wine or 80 year bottle of course like I
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.040]   Don't you the minute you touch it. You play it. It's gonna lose some fidelity. Yeah, it's gone
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.880]   I mean no, it's just a keepsake for me
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.440]   So neat. I remember when I was a kid
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.360]   We had the 45 I'm trying to remember it was I saw her standing there on one side
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.680]   Oh, she was just 17 and the other side would play it played it to death loved it loved it
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.960]   This week in nostalgia this week and beals
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.640]   Hey, a little
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.480]   Beep is it give me some German help here is it shodden Freud
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.680]   John and Friday when well, I'm is that the right word. I'm looking at Lenovo calm right now
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   Yeah, don't write it
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.880]   Cast it they probably fixed it in fact
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.440]   I know they've fixed their DNS entry, but they were hacked Lenovo calm was hacked
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.760]   By it looks like the lizard squad if you click the page or you look at the title of the page it goes back to it a Twitter
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.600]   account at lizards circle
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.960]   Don't know if the people who acted have anything to do with the slideshow the images the people in the slideshow
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.560]   Or even what's going on, but this is not if you went here to buy a think pad think twice
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.720]   This is this is not with no vote. This is the weirdest. This doesn't have any text as far as I can tell
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   It's just a slideshow of images. So so what are the odds? They've got super fish installed on their servers. Yeah
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.640]   Yeah, wouldn't that be funny?
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.400]   And of course there's a Java update a new version of Java is available. I let's skip that. Thank you
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.560]   Let me if I close that page. Oh it clicked and it brought me to the Twitter isn't that interesting?
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:06:00.360]   Yeah, of course Lenovo the news in the this week and Lenovo selling laptops with
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.680]   Software they claim were for it's free your benefit
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.980]   software they've been putting on there and stopped in January stop last month, but
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.000]   The ostensibly they claim was to help you searches in searches with image recognition was in fact merely
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.360]   intercepting all traffic including
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.080]   SSL traffic so that it could add ads to the web pages you were visiting ads that presumably benefited Lenovo
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.600]   Turns out that super fish had gotten this technology didn't bother writing it themselves
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.840]   They got it from a company called Komodia and we talked yesterday on security now about Komodia
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   Komodia apparently was run by 14 year olds. We're not sure because just the worst software ever
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.520]   Just they'll explain something to me was this but this was this was just junk word about her
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.720]   Why this is not software anybody wanted right it was what Lenovo says people want it in fact
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   We just had I had this debate with Paul throughout you earlier on Windows weekly
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.200]   He said he's every time he talks to the OEMs who make these Windows PCs loaded with bloatware
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.720]   He says the and to a man they all say no no we know people want these
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   Oh B
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.880]   Line the beest of S's you could say that with an antivirus you could see cuz all of them come bundled with McAfee
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.320]   Or oh and you see you could say it wouldn't be completely
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.640]   Bizarre to say well, we know people are gonna want an antivirus so as a as a customer convenience. We give them six months free of
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   antivirus acts of course Kevin Kevin do these things happen on your Chromebook?
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.880]   You know, it's funny you say I did I didn't my public service announcement and said hey if you need to remove
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   Superfish from your Chromebook here the steps
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.800]   Even even a Lenovo Chromebook
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.920]   As far as we know no Lenovo Chromebook has Superfish on it
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.400]   Well no Mac does either
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.760]   But I have to say you're right. This is this is something that Chrome OS doesn't have to suffer from no these OEMs
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   I mean they have to be getting money to
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.640]   For these apps to be put on there. I would imagine that that's the benefit is I would think right yeah
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:15.080]   You know, I mean the first thing that I thought was well, you know way we're kind of to blame because we've pushed the price down
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.520]   Solo on Windows PCs. I just bought a fifty nine dollar
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.040]   Windows 8 tablet the HP streams are 200 bucks for pretty decent
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.120]   laptops and so there because these the cost of goods is equivalent to the price they're selling it at in some cases they have to
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.600]   Make a profit somewhere. So that's what the the ad where I would presume. That's why they put the ad where on
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.240]   Although you got a look at Chromebook the same price for a Chromebook, right?
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.040]   And they can't put adware in a Chromebook
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.720]   No, there's very little that the OEMs can do or have done in the past
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.840]   I think Samsung put a couple of small apps on one of their chromes, but yeah
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.720]   I'm sure they had Google's blessing though. I mean, I don't I don't think it's something that you can just go and do
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.080]   Otherwise, I think we'd see this become a bigger problem in the Chrome OS area
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.920]   And we're not seeing that I'm sure Google controls this
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.240]   I just got the new Samsung Chromebook to review yesterday by the way. I'm before you buy really nice
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.160]   229 bucks. Yeah, really nice and no, I know presence of Samsung at all on it
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.240]   Yeah, that's
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:25.360]   Yeah, right can't but but while you're on the topic of Chromebooks since I brought it up and Kevin backed me up here
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.920]   Big news the big news
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.320]   pixel to pixel to all three of us the world Google admitted that
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.400]   85% of the use is all the Googlers, but Kevin you and I are the other 15% I
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.320]   Think so everybody went to IO three years ago as a pixel
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.200]   Yeah, even so I got all kinds of tweets immediately afterwards say Jeff your dreams come true
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.960]   This by the way was in a briefing Google did and has since pulled down
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:01.240]   Yeah, so Google's not admitting to it publicly. This was not a public admission, but who are they were talking to?
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:07.920]   Teamwork event wasn't it okay? Yeah, I think so teamwork is for people who I
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.400]   Think it's Google for work type. Okay, stop and
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.520]   The presenter said and here's some good news. Yes, we're working on a next generation pixel and
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.920]   Actually, that's that's the second time this month that this information has kind of gotten out and been pulled because
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.600]   We do a chrome show over at Gigan Omen
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.880]   We had noticed in the beginning of February several mentions of a device that was being worked on
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.960]   We look in the chromium OS bug tracker
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.400]   That's where Google is tracking bugs for all the chrome stuff
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.840]   They're working on and there was mention of a new laptop that had a light bar a touch screen with the same resolution of the pixel
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.920]   There was even a screenshot so we're like, uh-huh
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.400]   and they pulled the they pulled the screenshot and so we kind of figured two three weeks ago
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.480]   This was coming and you know, we should I don't know if you guys want to talk about what to expect
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.760]   But I I really expect a big big change here at least in the outside. I expect just better specs
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.040]   Don't you I really want LTE on it. That's one thing Google Google are you listening? Keep the LTE very important to me
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.800]   Otherwise, I think he has just a faster processor and probably some more memory and things like that
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.720]   But it's it's a it's a you know, what are you gonna do?
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.660]   What's the do well? There's one thing missing is the battery life isn't very good on it
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.360]   Well that that that too. Yeah on the pixel I should say and they and they and of course is pre has well
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.080]   So they by putting a broad well chip into it
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:29.160]   They should be able to double the battery life easily which will be amazing because right now. What are you getting three or four hours?
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   I don't get more than oh god. No
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.880]   It's about five is the advertised it, but I mean these pixels are almost two years old now
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.040]   So I'm getting about four because it's been used so much. I think it's excellent really
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.520]   Yeah, yeah
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.640]   You know turn the light down a little bit close once in a while that kind of stuff the
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.840]   Yeah, you know, the other thing is my touch screen is just starting getting a little hinky three years old
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.280]   But but I love the things still I actually brought mine out to compare it to the Samsung Chromebook, you know
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.400]   now thirteen fourteen hundred dollars versus two twenty nine and
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:09.240]   I have to say with the improvements that have been made in chipsets and so forth if the screen is not as good this
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.000]   That is a beautiful screen on the pixel. It's weird because it's for three aspect ratio
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.080]   Nobody's making screens like that in fact
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:23.720]   It's the one of the main reasons I can't use it on the air here is we've never been able to get to work with our our equipment because it's such a strange
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.560]   Aspect ratio, but in most other respects keyboard trackpad
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:33.640]   speed battery life the sand the two hundred twenty nine dollar Samsung Samsung not Samsung
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.840]   Samsung is is
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.720]   Pretty comparable in better in some ways. So it is time to Shiva the Toshiba one, you know
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.280]   It's a high-res screen for an ice cream. The only problem is it's high resin. So the type is just
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:57.720]   Three three two of course. It's not three two three. That's why it's really weird for three is TV aspect ratio. It's three two which is like a
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:05.240]   Surface through but but somehow Kevin, but they do say that they do this as a you know as a demonstration
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.960]   To show what a Chromebook can do. So there's got to be something in it that that revs the engine done there
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:18.600]   Well, we could do that too. I don't know about that. I don't know that there's that much more you can do
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:25.120]   With the hardware that's out there and available and still keep the prices down to where Chromebooks are going to be attractive to people
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.000]   This is the $1600 Chromebook
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.440]   That if price were no object you would you would do what you want. What could you do?
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.360]   You know that I don't know what they could do
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.640]   I I almost want to see them get rid of the touchscreen or offer a non touchscreen option and have us cut two three hundred dollars off the price
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.200]   You know that's one thing they could do make an $800 pixel. Well, you don't know what here's what I want
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:56.080]   I was thinking about this and I actually tweeted him and didn't get an answer considering but but my old gumba Michael Dell
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.880]   You go back to
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.840]   The early days of Dell. What was Dell specialty? You know
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   Burger King you have it your way
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:12.600]   Why doesn't Dell make a Chromebook that you can you can touch screen no touchscreen LTE no LTE this memory that memory
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.120]   Somewhere there should be a customized Chromebook and that would be your $800 machine
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.800]   Well and Dell does it now with at the low end
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.760]   I mean there's six different models of their brand new Chromebook 11 and you can get touchscreen no touchscreen 2 gig gram
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.480]   4 gig gram 16 gig of storage 32 gig storage. Oh, well, you know
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:38.560]   No, I mean that's that's geared towards the education market and I think that kind of points to the problem and that is
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:46.200]   There enough of a demand for a customized Chromebook that and OEM will take the risk and invest that kind of time and effort
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.560]   I don't know I think the lack of your range Chromebooks proves one point is that
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.920]   Part of the appeal if not the entire appeal of a Chromebook is his low price
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.440]   So making anything anything
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:06.760]   I know security simplicity ease of a group installation for a school. It is pretty amazing. You don't have to worry about
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:13.200]   Crap where I agree that's that's important to those guys and so so and that goes together with price for a school
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.280]   Yeah, but yeah, well, you know the other thing I think Kevin is
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.320]   You know I ran
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.320]   Watch McCall of the the Linux
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.880]   Distro on it for a while, but you could only do that in the dev mode
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.120]   I used to call it crona because it was tastier. Yeah, that's right
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.280]   And it was just too flaky to run in dev mode as my main machine
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.080]   But I could imagine that if you had a pixel that really was easily just switchable bit back and forth
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.040]   They're not gonna do that. Why would they do that?
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.800]   Because because their geeks run Linux their geeks one, you know that that would be hot for geeks
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.340]   Well, it's interesting because Rene
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:57.980]   Rene Niami who was the one who's said there's gonna be a new pixel and she did say what was it 85% of the users are Google employees
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.620]   What she neglected to say is nevertheless
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.660]   They didn't very make very many the vast majority of Googlers do not use Chromebooks. They use Macs
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.300]   Well the vast majority do yes, but I know lots of people who use their Chromebooks
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:16.540]   Yeah, but I'm just saying it's not the not even the laptop of choice. This is a time
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:21.200]   This is a laughable small whatever it is. It's a laughable small number. We know that we've always known that I
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.640]   Have to say though every time I review a Chromebook like the Samsung. It's so easy to set up
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.980]   It's just great because I said I spent a lot probably
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:37.020]   Most of the time I spend reviewing stuff is setting it up installing stuff getting it to work like I like it work
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:42.100]   Especially with phones. There's nothing easier to the setting up a Chromebook you log into your account and you sit back
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:49.180]   It's awesome. I don't think I've ever spent more than five minutes to get a Chromebook up and running from one to another
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.700]   I mean, it's just amazing. Well not only that to rebuild it entirely. Oh, I mess up
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.660]   So that's what minutes yeah
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:08.260]   It's done. All right. I got a new product for you. Just got the box. I got a mysterious email from Motorola a Lenovo company
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.060]   Although to my knowledge, there is no snapfish on Motorola phones yet
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:22.020]   But I just got an email last week from a Motorola saying we'd like to send you a box. It's embargoed to six to eight a.m.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.500]   Pacific time
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.340]   Wednesday the 25th today
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:31.780]   Your box will arrive and I think their hope was that people would have live unboxings all over the internet. I
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:38.340]   Just I wasn't gonna rush in so I came in at my normal time and we opened up the box and this is what we got I
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.580]   Think this is inspired. I wish more companies would do this from a point of view of a tech journalist
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:48.600]   What a wonderful thing so I open up the box and here here's it says slide to start
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.400]   It'd be great if it had a time run. You really couldn't I know
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.060]   Do not open wouldn't that be great?
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.020]   Well at a rock, you know what based on when it arrived
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.660]   I guess there wasn't really that wasn't an issue because I couldn't open it to arrive
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.500]   So you slide it open actually I'm sure it came out this way and it said the new Moto E
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.020]   So this is the second generation of Motorola's really inexpensive
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.980]   Phone list price 150 bucks and it was kind of cool. It says start here
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.180]   So you open the flap and that actually in here were
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.740]   These put your hand in and something will bite it off. I know
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.780]   These bumpers. This is one way you can customize it. They have a variety of colored bumpers
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.220]   And then you flip this open. This is I thought this was really cool. Here's the well-p-welcome desk
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.620]   Oh, you also had a badge with your name on my name on it said Motorola that would let
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.940]   So I already got my badge. Thank you at the welcome desk and there's
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:50.340]   And then you pull open the door and there's little seats for you and the other press to sit in and
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.340]   And there's what's what's his name?
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.540]   Ricosterlo. Hey Rick. He's a little Rick and there was a phone in here
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.940]   Which I've since taken out but that is so cute. Thank you Motorola
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.180]   What a great the phones was getting very good notices today that they've done a lot of price
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.060]   This is remarkable given now somebody said it was be it was for sale
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:20.420]   So let me unlock it because I think that's by might have leaked the price and information last week
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.980]   Somebody said it was for sale 120 bucks, but I think that's for that's for the three just for the 3g
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:32.540]   Okay, so this is the new one full 4g. It's a small screen. It's a QHD screen, which is what 960 by 540
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.380]   245 pixels per inch, which is
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.140]   Small but but not tiny now
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.300]   It's only eight gigs of storage in fact the first thing I had to do was take apps off because I it of course
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:51.140]   It immediately auto installs everything and once you take apps off, but it's a good-looking screen. It's fairly it feels fairly snappy
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.020]   It has you know, okay Google
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:00.980]   The standard okay Google doesn't have the lot of them a lot of the motos stuff, but it does have the watch while you're driving
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.300]   It will do assist the motor assist. Yeah, I really I love that
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:11.140]   There was and it's supposed now. I don't know anything about battery life yet because I just got it
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.340]   But it's a fairly hefty battery for a sigh something this size
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.940]   Here's the says meeting have a productive meeting so it won't ring now because I'm in a meeting which is awesome
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:25.380]   And it's lollipop and not only lollipop, but clean lollipop. It is
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.100]   It is effectively
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.100]   you know Google
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.620]   Version or any any motowear on it at all. There's just the moto apps there needed to do assist
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.860]   And I think it probably has the connect app which a lot or migration app my great
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.980]   Yeah, to migrate stuff. Oh, it's like a mini nexus. I mean, it's pure Google. It's pure Google
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.580]   So in fact for people want a really cheap nexus for development. This is a great choice
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.180]   They're saying in the press kit. They say it's for first-time phone
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.020]   You know buyers it's for kids
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.260]   This comes off and you can customize it
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.540]   There's a black version also and a variety of different colored little these little colored things
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.060]   Oh, this is something nice even though only a gig storage. It does support an SD card micro
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.820]   I'm just a third. I don't work it on that. Huh? Why don't why don't more phones?
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.700]   I think that's such a nice feature
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.260]   It's hard to do in the OS, but I think Google's figured it out now
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.060]   So if you wanted to storm it would be for more for music not so much to give you more app storage
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.660]   So now I've made it a pink phone
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.340]   because I like pink
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.500]   I think this is for a first phone. It's also third world oriented
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.940]   They will be a dual sim model and there is an FM radio in it. I think that's something that
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.780]   Already nation. Yeah, yeah, it's hard to know nations want but
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.860]   For anybody who wants a cheap unlocked phone
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.060]   I mean you think about just just remember back to our wonder of
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.820]   Smartphones and what this cost $129 for a phenomenal phone
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.820]   And also also compare it to the prices being rumored for the new Samsung
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:04.300]   Over a thousand bucks eleven hundred thousand bucks. Yeah, unbelievable. I
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.580]   Give Moto a lot of credit here. I mean they came out with this Moto E last year. I got one sitting here as well
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.100]   Great little disposable phone absolutely great backup phone
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:19.020]   They have a purple thing on your yeah, I put the purple band on there my little Rick costor low he won't stand up
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.020]   I don't know what happened
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.020]   he fell down but
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.940]   They they added a front-facing camera which last year's model did not have yeah five megapixels front and back
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.540]   No flash on the back, which is a little unfortunate, but that's okay
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.820]   You mentioned the Moto assist it also has the some of the notification stuff that the Moto X has yes
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.220]   You can't put your your hand over and have notifications appear. There's no sensors for that
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.540]   But if you nudge the phone when it's sitting down
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.500]   And the screen is off the screen will actually wake and show you your notifications
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.300]   So they're doing what they can with this, you know with very limited hardware
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.720]   I mean this is up to a quad core chip as compared to last year's dual core chip inside
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:03.860]   It's a snap dragon 400 410 something like that. Oh, yeah, it's not gonna set the house on fire
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.820]   They last year's model actually only had four gig of storage. So this is the eight gig is actually a doubling
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:14.300]   It really I mean it's almost the same prices last year plus it as LTE. I think this is remarkable. I yeah
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   I think that for a kid it's also
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.020]   Feels indestructible
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.300]   Gorilla glass very plastic II but boy you feel it also somewhat water resistant
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.980]   I feel like this is the kind of phone that somebody
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:32.900]   Would give a kid or your first phone if you're in a budget constrained. Yeah kakudos to Motorola
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.900]   I think this is really pretty impressive
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.660]   Kevin this is probably coming out of Chicago not out of China. I
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.620]   Mean the design and the accessibility and all of that well
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.620]   It's it's hard to say I mean if you look at it you can see in the band that I have I mean it looks like the Moto X
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.660]   Design which really originated back here. So they're kind of yeah
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.260]   I mean it's the dimple and everything
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:58.620]   It's just a reuse of a very smart elegant design and it's a little bit of a chunky monkey because of that battery
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.740]   But the you know they say 24 hours of battery life to be expected
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.140]   See that's remarkable
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:09.060]   I actually cast my Moto X aside in 2014 Moto X because I couldn't get through a day as much as I love it
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.740]   And I had the leather back and everything but you know if I get all the features in it last a day
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.460]   This thing's compact. I this isn't a bad choice at all
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.420]   You could actually buy buy one of these outright for 149 never put a SIM card in it
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.540]   Just use it as a Wi-Fi Android iPod for you know right
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:32.620]   Unlocked unsubsidized price well then 129 because you don't need the 4G right good point. Yeah
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.420]   Why did they release this before?
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.340]   Because there's gonna be a lot of noise from Barcelona starting on Saturday and
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   The best way to avoid that is to do exactly what they did
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.480]   Yeah, this clever little box with the mini Rick
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.820]   Osterlo in it and by doing that they got our attention didn't they?
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.460]   Hi, Rick yours is like yours is like falling over
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:00.940]   Yeah, he like there's glue on the bottom, but my glue never set so Rick. I'm gonna put him on my desk somewhere
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.500]   I like I really like Rick and I and I I really think I
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.620]   Hope to know what doesn't screw this company up as they have screwed up. Yes think that
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:18.540]   Nice nice job. We got is the thing bad bad. I mean, I know they just not have super fish
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:25.460]   It does not have super fish so it was only on the low the cheap consumer grade products that it has all that
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.820]   So yeah, here's some masking tape in here the obviously brick cost really even has a back
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.060]   Oh, they went all they went all my god
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.420]   holy cow
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.820]   Changes everything
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:53.940]   I love how this is kind of like thumb thumbing their nose at the big kind of what's become a tradition now
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.380]   Which is just that in order to get attention
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:01.500]   They feel like these companies feel like they need to throw these huge announcements
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:08.460]   filled with you know glamour and Broadway music and all this stuff when really all you need is a clever kind of
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.500]   Campaign that sent out at the right time
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:16.780]   Which in this case ends up being before Barcelona and they're gonna get a pretty decent amount of awareness and coverage out of it
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.820]   Yeah, you know what you know what else about that is that if you go to I've been you know
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:26.180]   I'm for the sake of of of Twitter. I've gone to the big Samsung event at Radio City. Oh God, right?
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.820]   We're where number one was an awful event number two. They don't give away any phones
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:35.420]   Yeah, there were three I'll bet it cost five times what just give it away the phone in the queue box
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.580]   Right, and I think they said a lot of these to bloggers and people who probably can't afford to go to Barcelona
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:47.500]   Don't they don't want to go to Barcelona. So you get more attention by doing that
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:53.900]   Yeah, smart. They're Moto the Moto X announcement this year wasn't or last year was in Chicago. I
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.380]   Think you need it on your shoulder. They'll I can do that
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.380]   Like it's picking your voice. You're you know the good the good angel of the bad angel. That's a good question
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.460]   He's hanging on for dear life, I can tell you that
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:15.940]   Rick Rick not long ago you could you would have stuck to your head I yeah, I probably still good enough
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:22.260]   No, no, maybe not free action figure with every phone purchase an act great. I love it
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.100]   Imagine imagine if you could have gotten this ear-owned Steve Jobs in the end of the day
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.780]   Let's take a break we come back
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.940]   I think we're gonna do like a mini changelog cuz Google has announced some big big thing
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:38.340]   I need stuff neat stuff and we'll talk a little bit about what's new with Google in just a second Kevin Tofol is here
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.020]   From giga home. It's always great to have you on Kevin. I appreciate that
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:47.020]   I wish I don't know how we got we got out of the habit of having Kevin Tofol on all the time
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:53.340]   I'm a bad habit to break. I don't want to break this habit. Don't worry. I'm on it. Yeah, Kevin's great
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.100]   As is everybody from giga home. It's a great bunch over there. I will let them know I appreciate him
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.780]   The emeritus is he all my merit is
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.940]   Meritess
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.860]   Emeritus yes, he's always good for a key money quote. Oh
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.900]   Yeah, just calm up
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:21.780]   Also, of course, Jeff Jarvis we have more coming up in just a bit our show today brought to you by hip chat as you probably notice
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.940]   Nowadays teams are distributed. They're all over the place
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:32.180]   I bet you it was rare that you get everybody a giga all-in-one spot when you have to work together though
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:38.100]   It's nice to have tools that make that easier. We discovered hip chat when we were working still are on a new
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:45.180]   Twit website the team we're working in in Austin uses hip chat and we did and now I keep it chat out running all the time
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.420]   We liked it so much the engineering team started to use it sales teams started to use it. We're gonna you
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.540]   I'm I want to still want to use it with my hosts, but they're a
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:58.980]   Fraction sponge. It's hard to get them to use anything. Maybe I should just send them an invite you could do the same
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:06.180]   Start your hip chat account right now for free at hip chat comm slash twig. What is hip chat?
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:14.500]   Well, it looks that first it looks a bit like instant messaging, but it is also video chat document sharing screen sharing
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:20.300]   System updates code sharing all integrated into a single simple easy to use platform
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:27.820]   There's all these plugins to 57 services that hip chat plays nice with like github and jure and zen disk zen desk
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:34.420]   We you know link he runs every time I have somebody posts a link into the hip chat and gives a synopsis of the page
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:39.900]   Little things like that make it so valuable so easy and fun to use
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:45.620]   Emails too slow. It's asynchronous meetings. They get sidetracked. They waste your time
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:53.340]   Regular instant messenger just doesn't have the features that hip chat has hip chat keeps your team in sync and by the way

[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:09.780]   There's got emojis and things which makes it kind of fun to play with your team easy to set up fun to use

[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:27.740]   Alright a mini Google change log you don't have to play the trumpets or anything
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:32.500]   You can't belong to I'm excited about this. We were talking before the show
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:38.940]   Google just announced that they are updating Google's play music's online storage
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:44.020]   To 50,000 songs. Oh look. It's Kevin Tofol has the story
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.860]   Do you do you want me to call you Kevin C Tofol?
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.860]   You could if you want I answered a lot of names
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:57.260]   The Vorax says you have to use the C as if there's another John de Vorak, but he that's his brand
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.260]   So I'll call you Kevin C Tofol if you wish
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:06.140]   This is great news. Tell us about it. Yeah, this is big news because up till now Google play music only allowed
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:12.820]   20,000 tracks in the cloud for free now for free you get 50,000 tracks
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:18.780]   Which is god I can't even imagine how many albums and all that is and I haven't come close to the limit on my 20,000
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.780]   But now you've got 50,000
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.580]   I actually I was an iTunes radio guy for a while
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.900]   But I moved over to Google play mainly because of the free storage
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.980]   Yes, now they've got the songs the integration which I love yes, and I mean a lot of tracks
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.860]   Are that I own are not available on Google play or elsewhere like my Beatles for example?
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:43.780]   So I upload those there that the real big thing to me is cross service cross platform services
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:51.060]   I can use Google play music on Android iOS Chromebook Chromecast PC Mac whatever
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:56.300]   So this this is really nice news for people who are Google play music listeners
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.640]   They also updated the iPad app. So it's a full native iPad app which really makes it because it's got such a great UI
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.540]   It's definitely material design and I think that's really nice
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:11.820]   They bought the songs of service we've mentioned this before and that's incorporated in so I think in terms of radio
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:16.140]   They absolutely compete very well with Pandora the fact that your own music is in there
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.980]   That's like Amazon music which does the same but now with 50,000 songs. I
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.020]   Was not able to get my whole library in there. I can't
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.060]   Oh, how 38,000 something like that Wow
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.220]   so
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.540]   Having everything in there, you know who loves this a friend of mine is a professional musician
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:41.460]   He has a lot of his own music has never been released on his hard drive and he was really concerned about losing it
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:46.340]   Google play music uploads it so it's it he end up
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.780]   This is the service that he uses because it not only gives you everything else
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:55.540]   All of his own music is stored on Google play music and available anywhere he can listen to Google play music
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.780]   So that's that is huge
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.780]   Mm-hmm. I I
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.860]   Use that you can get a little on your Android phone a little
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.940]   Widget that's a dice
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:10.740]   That's the I'm feeling lucky button and you just press that the dice goes rubber tumbly or the I'm feeling indecisive
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.180]   Yeah, yeah, I like I'm feeling lucky right like I just want to listen to something
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.020]   You know what they do this kind of need I thought at first
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.020]   Oh, it's just gonna be a mishmosh of all my stuff
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   But in fact they make a station that is kind of as a whole each time it's different
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.480]   But it's like if I you know if it start well, let's see what starts with here
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:33.540]   Frank Ocean and then Mac Miller absol king cuddy. It's all kind of Drake. It's all kind of ASAP rocky
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.060]   A lot of this is my own music, which is fun mixed in with some stuff
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.740]   I suppose from this the all-access
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:47.140]   I expected it not to work as much as well as it does for that very reason because you know often if it's just purely random
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.900]   You know, I've got I have I have music in Google play
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.980]   But I also have very random stuff in in Google play for you know
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.820]   Not so intentional reasons right if that comes up in a playlist like that's not ideal
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.660]   I think my son's music is ruining my Google
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:09.460]   The lucky there's a lot of like a lot of hip-hop in there. Let's see if I can refresh it get something different here
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.900]   You know what they have to fix is the device authorizations. Mm-hmm. Amen
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.740]   All right, yeah switch phones a lot like the first thing I did on this Moto E
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.620]   I just removed the Google play music icon
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:28.020]   So I can't even see it because if I hit it I'm gonna authorize this device and then we deauthorize for per year
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.140]   I actually had to work with Google to deauthorize all of mine
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.580]   Just so I could restart with my own personal devices and they were very you know gracious enough to do that and I appreciate that
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.900]   But you know that's that's got to go. So what's the total four device five devices for you?
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.720]   You can do ten ten devices five of them can be mobile such as tablets and phones
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.260]   It's pretty much an unlimited amount of
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.740]   Computers because you can use the browser for that so it's not it doesn't really count
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:59.100]   But you know for people who review devices all you do you open that like or that app and all of a sudden you just authorize a device
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:05.060]   And that's that's a mess. I refresh my radio and finally I'm getting my music you can you can turn this up if you have my
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.700]   audio I don't know
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.980]   When my granny was 95
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:18.420]   I love listening to Navy Seals March incadences when I'm in the gym
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:24.780]   So after this we're gonna get the Marine Corps marathon song airborne rangers. Where have you been?
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.660]   Rescue Ranger somehow I got
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:37.260]   The American Patrol by the American military band the US Army Green Barreis singing
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.260]   Oh Lord, I want to go home. I
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.140]   Have a I have a military cadence channel
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:50.900]   Made for me is a is a drill sergeant telling you to get off your fat ass an exercise for me by Google
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.180]   That is where that's coming from playlist. Yes
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.180]   I gotta go do some pushups. I
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:07.140]   Confessed to having a few cadences on my album in my my albums. So you really do yeah
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:14.420]   You know wait wait wait, I'm using you really no I really do I saw it obviously saw that picked it up and
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:20.980]   Ran with it and I mean ran with it because I've never seen I didn't know this all existed okay, I
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:27.340]   There's apparently this is from military modern military cadence volume one
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.820]   Seen an old lady. There's multiple volumes. Oh, yes. Oh
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   Oh

[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.500]   Here's the C bees
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   Pump me up
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:54.260]   No
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:38:00.020]   Okay, this is how Google wins the internet there is no other music service
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.740]   Put this playlist together
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.180]   That's amazing
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.500]   Okay
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:17.140]   That's so wacky it is I you know to go from ASAP rocky to the US Army Airborne at Fort Benning, Georgia
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.700]   One mile no sweat
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:25.580]   Pretty impressive and this is in the Google collection not some of that was my
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.020]   What's my I'd add that to your library Leo

[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.180]   I don't think I
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.860]   No, cuz I've been buying things on CD and leaving it on CD
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.740]   Oh, you know you got needles on vinyl and I haven't you know, I haven't digitized that yet
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.620]   I put every I get everything into my computer one way or the other so
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:23.460]   The other thing that's changed and this is less of an exciting change apparently the porno is leaving
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.540]   Blogger, what do you think about that? I think it's smart
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.180]   It means that Marissa Meyer owns pornography now, which is great
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.900]   Starting
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:40.620]   I'll explain that in a moment starting March 23rd. You cannot publicly share images and videos
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.700]   They're sexually explicit or show graphic nudity on blogger
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:50.980]   Google says will still allow nudity if the content content offers a substantial public benefit see that's that's the
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:59.020]   Well, if it's an anatomy lesson, maybe or something well, we say I don't want Google to be on any I really I really don't like this
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.020]   The problem is it part of takes over
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.700]   Look at Tumblr
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:10.020]   Yes, so that's the real problem. It's I think it's on blogger. I think it's I think it's a sequestered
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.220]   You know, there are warnings
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:19.100]   It's true. Don't you have to go through a block you do you're gonna see it don't do it of course if you're
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:25.220]   13 years old you go looking for that right but but my issue is that I don't want the Google nanny I
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:30.460]   Don't want Google to become our artistic and and it puts Google in a position
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.180]   where
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.180]   You know pick your country
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.740]   The problems are gonna have well if you'll do that in America if you get rid of porn America
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.740]   Why don't you get rid of pictures of women here?
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   I I am not comfortable with Google putting itself in this position and
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.260]   I was always kind of proud of them that they allowed it really not saying you got to like porn
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.060]   but they allowed it because they they they they speak and
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   I'm Google. I'm what's going on here. The only thing I can figure out is that this is maybe tied to the YouTube for kitties. Oh
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.240]   Which was also released this week. It's a new
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.300]   Yeah at the exact same moment read it does the same thing. I was just gonna say read it
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.700]   Yeah, just feel well read it didn't do exactly the same thing already
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:18.260]   It is say if you're gonna put an explicit content up you have to have the permission
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.980]   It has to be from the person who's in it or you have permission of the person who's in it
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:28.620]   Which is a direct response? I think to the fact that reddit was being used for up skirts for jail bait
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.820]   You know our side chart jail bait for revenge porn and of course for Jennifer Lawrence images
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.860]   Reasonable response I know
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.740]   And I get the scourge of the of the crappy stuff going on
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:48.420]   But but you know to try to find the price you go to to tumblr to find the provenance of any given
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:54.140]   No, which means you can't you can't from you can't put that up. You have to I know what that means almost
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.020]   It is it almost becomes weirdly more intimate
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.220]   right
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.460]   And
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:08.500]   And how do you have to prove you're the permission me again? Yes, right? It's dealing with something that slimy and awful
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.300]   Was going on I think read what it's doing is reasonable. I do
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.280]   I I'm not sure I agree with you on Google
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.340]   It's gonna be if Google were the only place you know if blogspot were the only place you could get this stuff
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.500]   Maybe but Tom now if tumblr says no more adult material and tumblr
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.100]   Then maybe that's a general shutting down
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:32.300]   I think the issue Leo is is is I understand Google shouldn't be the
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:37.740]   Arbiter I agree of what's good and bad for us and this is a challenge because Facebook
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:43.460]   Google+ all of these sites to some degree do have to become arbiters, don't they?
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:50.860]   You know not everything goes but I think Facebook and Google+ and are a bit different
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.660]   Facebook won't allow people breastfeeding breastfeeding
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.100]   I know which I've always thought is awful
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:43:00.940]   I thought it was absolutely ridiculous and I never I never liked that out of Facebook and you know part of what is is
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.100]   Is it we're spreading our American puritanical view to the world?
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.940]   You know go into a French subway or a German subway and look at the billboards and you see
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.260]   breasts women have them
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:18.340]   And I'm talking about you know, hard porn and disgusting stuff for all that but that isn't I mean truthfully
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.980]   That's not you're not just incidental pictures of breasts on I understand but now where it wears away as the line
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:28.680]   So they're not they're not saying you know tasteful. There's they're basically saying
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:35.000]   nudity right yeah, that's and that makes it a little difficult. Yeah, that's that's a problem because because
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.780]   But well, it's just as bad if you say tasteful
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:43.300]   That's an American standard now set to the world and I think in a diverse and open world
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:49.780]   That's wrong and they were the problem here is the reverse can happen Iran can say no no no use our standard for the world
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.140]   right
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.580]   And indeed, you know kind of tries that mean there should be no standards at all
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:02.260]   Of course there standards. This is this is the free speech and yelling, you know fire in the theater argument child pornography
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.940]   Yes, you don't you don't allow it. I agree with that there are victims to it
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:13.420]   There's a play that I just read the review today on the Times called the nether that came from London to New York
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:19.740]   About a evidently a very disturbing but apparently very well done play that I'm now eager to see
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.980]   because it's about the idea of having a
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:31.180]   Made-up world the nether is a new world for the internet and you go into this wonderful place where you
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.020]   and you don't see this perhaps but but you
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:41.380]   are part of child pornography and and and and violent crimes against children, but they're made up children
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:48.500]   So they're trying to play obviously with right how far do we go and and that's a fine discussion to have Kevin. What do you think? I think I?
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:54.560]   Need I need to hear from both sides, but the bigger news to me is that people still use blogger to be honest
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   I
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:02.880]   Didn't even know about this until it hit the headlines and whatnot. Yeah, no, I know I know I
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.540]   Got my start way back when using the blog spot and also, you know
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:12.720]   I see where Jeff's coming from because I don't know that I want one singular company
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.680]   Especially in the US to dictate what's happening in the world how these tools are used and so on
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.880]   The question though is you know does Google just not want to be held responsible for the contents that's on there
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.860]   You know if they're going to be held responsible for what they're what they're hosting then they want to lay down the law
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:33.640]   I'm not saying I agree with it, but I can I mean Apple doesn't get any heat for doing this data
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:40.080]   They well they get a little bit of heat I guess but there very dead they had to do a spec Apple had to do a special arrangement with built
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.600]   the largest newspaper in Europe because
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.960]   Built has you know my my line about built is that it's tabloid at heart, but the paper is bigger
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:53.240]   So the naked breasts are bigger, you know, it's on some big paper and that's part of built and
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.920]   So they had to get dispensation for breasts in Germany and Apple said okay because you're a newspaper in Germany
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   We're gonna let you put boobs in your app
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:08.700]   That's see this is what your that's this is the reductio ad absurdum
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:13.440]   Yes, they're pointing out that where do you draw the line and it gets sillier and sillier and
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.520]   You know, it's just covered on both sides it is culture if you go to Germany and I'm not you know
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:24.320]   Or sooner than me go to Germany you turn on TV a technical night and you get the the sex the ads for the sex call channels
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.360]   It'll blow you away the first time my god
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.400]   By you used to go to New York to watch public access
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.600]   dirty dirty George I mean I'll be George George George. Yeah
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.840]   I was I was blown away by that and that's a that's a
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:46.320]   unfreely available television for you kids for you kids who don't know the reference not the why should we spread this
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.400]   For anyway, but ugly George was this very odd guy who would walk around and in
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.840]   Short shorts and kind of wearing foil and in the earliest days had a huge VCR in his back
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:02.640]   Yeah, the huge camera and he would his whole shtick was to water the streets of New York and and and attract as he put it
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   goils to
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.840]   Follow him into it into a hallway or room somewhere to show off their body. It was I was it
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:15.520]   It was on Manhattan public access a TV and now by the way, it's on YouTube
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.440]   Well, then I'll see in a few minutes. Oh, we should be very careful here
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:27.280]   Although this is YouTube how far could they go in fact doesn't that raise the issue of what do you do with YouTube?
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.320]   That's a good question. Yeah
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.000]   Well, how far does I don't even know how far YouTube goes? What the world is I have to say?
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.560]   Uh, I have it I live with a 12 year old now and I'm and he watches youtube all the time and I'm shocked by some of the stuff that's on youtube
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.080]   but no
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.920]   no sex
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.000]   No, no explicit nudity
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.200]   Which makes you wonder what I'm gonna see here
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:54.800]   Me too. Um should I just keep going here? I'll play it and watch and I'll let you know
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.920]   No
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:06.720]   Um coco crystal posted this who that was the young lady at the beginning apparently she was an advertiser in public access television in the
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:12.880]   I guess I don't know there was another talk show where they just sat around nude. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there was a woman
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.560]   Uh
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.280]   Yeah, I can't remember remember a name visit New York and say it beat a friend's apartment and say whoa
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.440]   television
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:29.760]   Yes, so this video they cut away as quickly as they can from the nudity. Okay, but apparently they're not as swift as they think
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.640]   I mean, well, okay now now I'll argue your point. You've got a point
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.920]   So if what if youtube had allowed sex then it would have turned entirely. Well, that's the problem in the new port
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.880]   That's the problem. Yeah, and we have you point
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.320]   There is literally a place called you porn and if you want that you can go there there is a precedent youtube you've got a point there
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.720]   Um
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.640]   I can understand not you know, not in my not wanting it's in my backyard
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.200]   Yeah, I get that too, but but again google is in a particular
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.920]   position where it is a gateway to
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.800]   through content right now
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.240]   um
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   And and they're in such
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.280]   Hot water all around the world on on try you know
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.160]   Everybody's trying to make them salute their local standards
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:19.200]   So I am not I am not approved as everybody knows
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.960]   And uh, and I am very sex positive and I like nudity
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:28.800]   But I also think that it should that it's not necessarily a bad thing to segregate it
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:34.320]   So that i'm fine with that even I who enjoy all of this don't want to see it everywhere
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.720]   Yeah, I'm absolutely fine with that and labeling and all that kind of stuff. I think as only was
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.680]   Um, but you know, what's going to happen is some german
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.960]   Nutus club and there's lots of them because it's it's a cultural belief
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:50.400]   Is going to come in and find their their site taken down when they're to them. This is not pornography
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.840]   Well, let me point out that you could you can still have it. It just has to be private by invitation only
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.040]   If you're a club you can invite everybody in the club and they can okay
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.520]   What if you're trying to use it as a marketing tool for people to come to your new somewhere? I mean it just
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.320]   Oh, it's what you know, you can't be on google
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.920]   I'm just let's not here. I am you know defending pornography today on the show. No, no, no
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.160]   You're defending free speech really, but I'm also trying to defend google against the precedent
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.120]   Of being forced to be the world's nanny and and I see
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.440]   Um, the unintended consequences in danger of that. That's what's worrying me about this
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.160]   Uh, you know, and then I look at tumblr and it's
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.920]   It's infested
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.960]   That's an issue. I get it. It's a brand issue. I get it
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.240]   and uh now
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.720]   Marissa my our owns pornography is this really I mean
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:47.360]   Yahoo is home to if you everybody go from blog spot to tumblr because anything goes
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:52.560]   Actually, you know what they actually come to think of it. They do anything does not go in tumblr
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:59.440]   Uh, they've done a variety of things to reduce the vera the amount of uh adult content on tumblr
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.120]   So
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.440]   I don't know I took my uh, my daughter my daughter's class from her school. She's a high school senior
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.960]   And as a class around women in media they're doing a three-week project. So I took them into meet katie koric
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:15.840]   Yesterday who was wonderful and delightful and generous fun. It was really great. They were really
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.440]   Wow, what a treat for them. Uh, it really was it really was and they got to talk with her for a bit
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.400]   And they also got to talk to market Sullivan of the New York times. They got their cutting ass
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.120]   My media connections came in handy. But anyway, as we're in the elevator going up to yahoo
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.520]   Which is which by the way, you know is in the old new york times building
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.920]   In the great lady. It's so funny. Yeah, it is
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.400]   They went from visiting the New York times at his new building over to visiting yahoo at the old new york times building
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.880]   They didn't they didn't understand the by the late at this irony
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.320]   Um
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.480]   Was we're going to the elevator up to yahoo. They're saying
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:48.560]   Tumblr, Tumblr. Can we see tumblr? That's where we're gonna see tumblr. They were all excited about that. Yeah kids love someplace
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.120]   Yeah, um
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.440]   and as of course
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.760]   To my mind and I agree with you weber we he says we could show all sorts of violence
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.160]   You know when it comes to nudity and healthy sexuality. No, no
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:07.840]   Um, so you know, but that's the world we're in. I don't want to see by the way. I don't want to see violence
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.000]   Everywhere I go on the internet either. Oh, I think uh
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.760]   I don't know the problem is a fence is a terrible standard. It's very hard. It's wrong as it's a real court knows
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:26.240]   Ryan was at his standard. Yeah, child pornography is illegal and has victims and and you get rid of it because of that
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.680]   Right, uh, but to get rid of something because it could offend someone
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:34.800]   the slipperiest of slopes nightmare in a chat room raises a good point which is
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.880]   Uh
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.720]   In workplaces you absolutely cannot be looking at adult content period
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.840]   Uh, it the workplace is liable
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.720]   Uh, you know, you you can lose your job with a workplace can get sued for making a a
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.760]   Uh hostile work environment
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:57.680]   So maybe this is just an attempt by blogger. I mean if they use those standards to say we want to make sure all of our
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.920]   sites are work friendly
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.600]   I so I was sitting in the faculty meeting and I must confess that faculty means I do have the uh tweet deck up
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.360]   Don't go to tumblr
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.040]   Well, no, but I had up there was a guy there was a guy who um
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:16.160]   I don't know how he had my fears all of these things you put in your in your twitter feed three years ago
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:23.360]   And there's a guy who had great jokes about the jets turns out he also runs a stripper club
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:28.000]   I've had that or a service in north in new england and i've had him on there for three years
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.960]   Only like last week that he started putting up naked pictures on twitter
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:37.200]   And I and the first one popped up as i'm in the faculty meeting with faculty on either side of me. Nice. Yeah, it's so you say what i'm saying
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.600]   But but no
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.440]   Shouldn't that have a warning that you would say I agree to see the you know the
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.440]   Potentially offensive setting in twitter that you could say I don't want to see it
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.120]   Yeah, I think I have that set because I I don't have any of those those pop-ups
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.160]   You know just show up because that could be obviously embarrassing right
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.880]   um
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.840]   But that's another good point twitter doesn't seem to have any rules do they
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:05.520]   No, I never get that was the first time I saw a naked picture on twitter. I swear. I never get them
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:12.160]   Yeah, it may be i'm just with you know ancient old prudes if you follow people with x x x in their handle
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.480]   You're more likely to see something
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:22.400]   Um, all right. Well a good discussion. I don't know what the answer is frankly
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.480]   I guess i'm i guess you've swag you swayed me jeff
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.680]   But I do understand how a couple you swayed me too
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   because the youtube example does set a precedent I get it but
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:41.120]   Only you know societally redeeming breasts may now be seen
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.200]   So whose whose job is it to go beat you go to go be the breast bluster
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.600]   You know
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:54.160]   Well, that's the problem, but but google faces this in every respect they have to decide this and all the time
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:00.080]   They're always an arbiter to some degree. Um, and maybe the difference of forces. They're not just linking to what they're so they're hosting
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   Yeah
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   Yeah
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.280]   Eight
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.480]   Hun i'm sorry 500. Oh, that's probably a number. I shouldn't give you
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.840]   Steel this number. No, that's okay. You're right. You're right. I got numbers. I can have this one
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.360]   Yeah
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:24.560]   535,000,000,000,000 hours are lost to driving every day
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:32.320]   That's an amazing number half a billion hours. I'll tell you leo leo. Yeah 500,000 those are mine
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.720]   This is from a 2007 study done by harvard healthwatch
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:43.760]   The average american spends a whopping 100 mint one minutes a day driving. That's crazy
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.360]   Is that's crazy
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.000]   I am now two hours now
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Wow
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Pulaski skyway
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Is being prepared and it is
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.520]   Yes, it's a mess
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.200]   Uh, yeah, it's a it is it is god awful and so i'm two hours
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:07.600]   You know i'm today. I could have stayed home because I had no idea to do this here because my office is flooded
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.880]   Student wanted to see me no higher priority for me
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.600]   One meeting scheduled so I go i've been two hours for half an hour meeting with the student
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.120]   Nice most of two i'll get done while i'm there and drive two hours back
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:24.240]   This is a a great article by uh james bellfoy who is uh
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:29.760]   On medium he's founder of views wagon, which is a ride share advertising platform
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:35.040]   Which is kind of intriguing, but he says one of the incentives for google to do a self-driving car
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:39.360]   Is that's 101 minutes they could they could get back that you'd be surfing the internet
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:45.040]   And not only that would if you add that up half a billion hours
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:52.480]   A day recovered for google is a lot of revenue. Yeah. Well, in fact he calculated his four billion dollars
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.080]   Nice
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:59.680]   And it also gives google something else which is what your android gives you and weighs gives them is your destination
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.040]   Where you're going?
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:04.320]   And what what's along the way google now just started like i'm going i'm going
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:08.080]   I don't know if it's in the chain do we do we do we ever do we break out of the changelog?
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.240]   Could you just start one changelog thing and then lose i did squirrel
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:18.640]   I did two whole changelog things and that's all we had now we we actually have things in the changelog block down like
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:25.120]   Rogue on the changelog i went rogue i will do more changelog go ahead finish your throw
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.880]   Um, uh, I didn't know we had a changelog block. I'm sorry
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:33.280]   Well now we'll tell you gas stations along the way the feature that I want which people remember it and told me on twitter
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.800]   Is that I want when I'm going from here to there. I want to be able to say
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:41.280]   Don't tell me the nearest starbucks which is you know, I can't there's no exit here
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.920]   I want you to tell me the starbucks along the way
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:48.000]   Or the or the restaurant the kind of restaurant I like along the way
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.440]   I like mexican restaurants tell me the next one at the next exit
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.840]   And all you would have to do to your thomas vehicle is you wouldn't even have to you just say stop at the nearest
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:01.440]   At the next extra restaurant, right? You even have to search for it. Did he stop at the next mixing restaurant?
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.960]   It sounds like you need a carbox on the polasky skyward you need a starbucks on the polasky
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.040]   Kevin are you in new york too?
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.960]   I'm in pennsylvania, but I head into the city
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:16.000]   Which is a three-hour drive for me for events and such and one of those hours is on the polasky skyway
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.760]   Yes, oh, I feel so bad right now because it's because it's it's broken
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   So I make my living on people who are stuck in their cars. I might add
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.720]   But I feel so bad for you. I am so sorry
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.280]   My commute five minutes and I could walk it if I fell like you
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.640]   I hate you and it's so funny when google pops up that uh, it'll be seven minutes. There's traffic on the way
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:46.480]   Just makes me smile, but I did for many years. I had it to our to our plus commute
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:52.560]   That's right. So I know what it's like and I just uh that was one of that's actually to me one of my strongest
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:58.400]   Factors to moving to pedaluma once I moved here to not working in san francisco
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:05.440]   And that's how twit came about all right inbox by gmail now in more places. This is the
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.720]   Gmail interface that I prefer but a lot of people
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:16.160]   Uh, don't like an awful lot they've added as I mentioned google music and now inbox both have native ipad apps
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:21.200]   Also inbox supports firefox and safari you don't have to use chrome anymore
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.680]   Have you come around on you don't like this jeff do you um
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.800]   I'm afraid of it
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:34.160]   You remember how much you scared me when you had me put up those in gmail you have me put up these tabs and I
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.640]   Didn't like it. Yeah, it freaked
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:42.960]   And the problem is I don't know what it's like because it's only good, you know on my gmail account which I don't use
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:48.800]   I use my apps account. So when it comes in i'm afraid it's gonna be like an autonomous car
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.720]   Uh, where's gas pedal where's breaks on this thing?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:59.360]   Uh, I don't know why but it's the first thing I've ever found that gets me to inbox zero
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:05.840]   It's easy. I use it on all my devices. I even wow so you are really oh it is the app for me and they haven't do you use it?
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:11.600]   You know I I try it every now and again jeff and I struggle because there's such a low information density there
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.400]   I don't get a ton of information. I guess that's the whole point of it, but I'm so used to
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:22.240]   You know being drowned in gmail for the past 10 years that I can't break out of it. Yeah
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.600]   Um
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:32.000]   I don't know. I seem to be the only person who likes inbox. It is missing a lot of features. I I there's no signature
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.240]   I have to use a macrow to put my signature and there's no encryption. I think that's really important google needs to add that
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.440]   Yep, nevertheless, uh, it's just the fastest way to do triage for me. There's no undo
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:49.120]   Undo send which for me and undo send there is no undo send in mail there is in gmail
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:54.080]   Oh, because there is that's because gmail just holds on to it exactly and I use it all the time
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.360]   And how many times do I send something in the minute? I send it
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.000]   I read the thing that I wasn't supposed to type in there and I
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   Change it when I get an email from somebody who sent something something something something wrong to me
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.040]   And then I get another email from them saying, you know darlene wants to retract that email and I just laugh
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.240]   Because if you're using outlook for everybody's using exchange and outlook you can do that
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.600]   But the only in certain circumstances. So so the other problem I have with now is that I use
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.480]   uh, mark is unread like crazy
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:28.320]   Because that's my way to say okay. I know about this. I'll do with it later when the market is red
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.840]   And there's a pin thing where it better than this better than mark is unread you can mark is unread
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.000]   You can move so i didn't find it
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.920]   You just move it to the inbox and it's unread but the better way to do that is to pin it
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.280]   There's a little thumbtack icon stuff you pin sits there forever until you unpin it or you sweep it
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.360]   I don't want that either
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.680]   I I tried to use the star and gmail. Yeah, but it's like it's do list to me. I I can't do it
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.720]   I just can't do it. So it'll stay there for a little longer
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.360]   But then if I don't really do anything with it well, god didn't mean me for me too
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.840]   I have noticed that people are in in in boxes and each email are very personal
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.960]   And the more that you've customized it and specialized it and got it just right the less likely you're going to use a new system
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.160]   Frankly and it's just it's interesting how personal
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.840]   Everybody's email habits have become just mostly because I think it's so information overload and we have to have some solution
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.880]   Um, so I my email system wasn't working for me. So it was easy for me to shift
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.400]   And I have done I have had big filters and all that say you know 1800 you dora filters and stuff
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.000]   Google launches invite program to bring inbox to google app for work customers
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.960]   So I guess I can now invite people who use apps
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.040]   Well, we we have google apps for our email here you can
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.040]   apply
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:57.280]   To be one of the first companies to be able to integrate inbox into google apps
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.600]   All right, let's hear from our staff who wants me to do that. I do
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.920]   Mike l can I so do and you do Jason you like
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.960]   I like inbox. I think it would be incredibly useful
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.280]   More so in business than it would be in my personal needles. You don't want it
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.760]   Slanina he doesn't like anything google though. So he doesn't care Jason clamps. Just a motion. Is it?
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.560]   Yeah, you don't have to use it. No, no, you don't have to use it
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.080]   That's well, so what's not everybody's not forced into inbox. It just means that it supports it. So I should apply
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.040]   Sure, where do you apply?
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.200]   I think your admin has to
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:42.160]   Your company is me he has his own personal google for yeah, I'm just apps. So it's just me
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:49.440]   Uh, yeah, I should apply Russell. Would you is Russell still here Russell? We I don't know who our admin is he must be Russell
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.720]   Russell's the admin
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   inbox, okay once so
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.840]   You have to email google at inbox for work at google.com
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.360]   First invites will be going out next month only admins can ask
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.920]   Make sure you do something nice for your friendly neighborhood sis admin on july 31st
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.600]   Nice plug for sis admin day
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.800]   Um, I was that again leo inbox for work inbox for x at google.com
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:25.920]   Google says companies that should consider signing up for the early adopter program are those that want to use inbox as their primary email service
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:34.320]   whose employees are heavy mobile email users and those that want to partner with google and user studies to learn more about how employers use this
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:40.320]   Service we do use you know we have at twit.tv is our uh domain and we use it
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.600]   The truth is I don't ever check my email at twit.tv
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:53.280]   Because I can't use it. That's another solution entirely. Yeah, I was gonna say there's no such thing as inbox zero except of course
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.040]   Just deleting all of your email shutting down your email accounts entirely
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.800]   Just go offline. Yeah, I remember seeing my inbox with 25,000 unread messages
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:10.960]   By the way, the way I fix that is I use that was the most satisfying sweep of the day. I used inbox. I pressed sweep
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.400]   25,000 messages gone
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.240]   That was a nice and did you suffer any consequences from doing that? I have
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.040]   My mother thinks I died
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   Okay, well, it's a big consequence
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.920]   No, no, I have no zeros no consequences because anybody who hadn't heard from me by now
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.960]   That's the thing I hold on to these emails for so long like I really do need to get back to this person
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:39.600]   This email is three months old. I guarantee you that person is not losing sleep over the fact that they didn't hear back from me at this bright
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.200]   Email that's called. I hate email
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.040]   That's there's a word for that declaring declaring email bankruptcy. Yes
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.000]   And you send an email out to people and say hey or you post it somewhere. Hey, oh no
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.120]   That's every day for me inbox here. I'll tell you what I'll tell you when you hear inbox zero when you die
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.240]   I plan to have an auto responder when I die
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:09.520]   We know you have an inactive account manager take your after that's right. Yeah, right
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:16.240]   AdWords app for android, but it's only in Canada. I'm at next item. Google explain
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.160]   Yeah, I did this didn't excite me all around google expands flight
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.840]   I didn't even know there was a google flight. Now this helps you decide where to go. This is the flights
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.160]   shopping service
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.160]   Did you know about google flights?
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.160]   Yeah, yeah, I use it actually some really instead of like Expedia
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.160]   Yeah
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.160]   Uh, gonna get frustrated with Expedia. It's very good
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.720]   Uh, this is using their ita
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.840]   They bought it. It's more aimed for people. I mean
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.560]   I'm doing a business thing. This is gonna sound obnoxious
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.280]   But i'm doing a business thing and i've said, you know, I want this flight and I want it business class and I want this
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.640]   No, this these things are all meant to find you better prices, right?
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.680]   But but if you if you go in and try to search for
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.560]   some destination
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.720]   it will um
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:08.080]   Give you a very nice visualization of flights, but notice what what was just there leo on the last screen. Yeah
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:12.960]   Suggested destinations. That's what's new here. Uh, google knows what's best for you
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.800]   You're looking to go to fort worth, but maybe you'd rather go to hanalulu. Yeah
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.600]   You're so right google
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.920]   That's pretty fun. Although it is a little devilish, isn't it?
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.400]   Um
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:34.080]   Perhaps let me let me do this. So is it flight? I didn't even know about this dot google dot com
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.040]   Um, so let's say this is a flight and i'm
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.960]   uh round trip san francisco to fort
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.160]   worth
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.160]   texas i have to
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.600]   She's trying to decide there's a podcasters hall of fame induction ceremony in july 31st
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.400]   Trying to decide if i want to go
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:03.040]   I don't think i can because it takes forever, but let me just so where does it suggest better places to go? They call that main page
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.520]   You already did that a bit ago. Yeah, that was for hotels. Yeah
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.920]   All right, uh
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.560]   Go back to the main page the flights page. Oh, I see here
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.000]   So notice that nine similar flights and that does these nice visualizations. Yeah, this is nice. Yeah
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.640]   I'll be using this from now on
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.440]   Show 12 longer and more expensive flight. This is good
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:29.360]   I would you know use kayak and hip monk and all that stuff. This is this is competing with that. Yep
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:36.080]   Yeah, because they're not I imagine if I choose this flight, I then get sent to elaska airlines. Yeah, you book with elaska
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:42.080]   And I don't know what the business dealers does does google get a spiff. I have no idea probably travel agents
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.280]   That's what i was wondering because usually if you uh book reservations flights, whatever
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.400]   All that stuff comes through email. So google now actually has all that information. So I know they're not getting additional information
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:57.360]   They didn't have so what's the angle here right san francisco to barf alona
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.880]   Let's go right now
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.360]   All right. Well, that's fun. I'm not getting suggestions here, but I did on hotels
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.800]   Now, what do they suggest better than barcelona? There's nothing better than barcelona. Yeah, they didn't bother
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.320]   No, it's nothing better
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.440]   Oh
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.000]   Bass searches barcelona dallas fort worth suggested destinations. I see so it's when you go
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.360]   Uh when you first enter it will give you some suggestions
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.080]   I'm not sure why they what they get out of that
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.440]   Does matter does paris give them a little kickback for everybody
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:36.160]   It comes to well, it's also it's also the philosophy the google wants to give you the core information not send you all over searching for stuff
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.040]   Which of course, right?
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:43.280]   This is off those sites where you went searching before what I want is is okay google get me the hell out of here
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.200]   That just does it
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   My self-driving car takes me to the airport. I get on a plane. I don't know where i'm going
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.800]   I'm most best. Yeah, you want i'm feeling lucky but for travel for travel. Oh, that's a great idea
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.960]   I want that every time of my name. Would that be fun. That would be pretty great. Yeah
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.600]   So the google calendar app or the end has changed on the android. I always I use sunrise
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.440]   But uh, apparently now you can get a uh, seven day
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.320]   view pinched to zoom
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.640]   And more on the calendar app. You know on a small phone a seven day view
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.480]   It's not
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.880]   It's not I guess it hasn't been implemented yet online
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.000]   Seven days zoom a lot of people complained about the fact that there was no seven day view on the phone
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.680]   You would appear on a tablet with a larger screen, but it wouldn't be on a phone
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.040]   You can't even tell what you're looking at but I guess people are used to this seven day
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.600]   I am yeah, well you can you can tell what's most important is all that though that day is free
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.760]   Yeah, but you know what what happened is that I'll have a I'll a haircut on the saturday
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:47.040]   And I and I won't have looked at the at the saturday calendar because there's no business appointments and then I say oops
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.880]   Oops
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.520]   I missed that you know who had the mobile calendar done right that was palms webOS. I hate to
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:01.200]   Make a dead horse there, but uh, you know it would accordion your calendar would accordion fold
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.320]   And it would show you when you had open slots when you didn't and such it was really nice on a mobile screen
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:14.960]   Well, maybe we'll get it on the who who's using webOS now somebody's using it lg on their tv's. I think yeah, there you go
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.520]   Yeah, so i'm a calendar on my tv
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.160]   Oh
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.640]   That's the google change log
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.600]   Right
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.200]   Oh
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.640]   DGG why did google buy toro?
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.000]   Which is not fatty tuna
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.240]   But a facebook marketing startup formerly known as red hot labs
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.920]   uh
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.920]   toro
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.520]   Is used to make launching and optimizing a facebook ad campaign as easy as possible
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.560]   Why maybe they just maybe it's in a choir right it's these two guys
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.160]   Yeah, because it did seem a little odd. I can't imagine that google cares about how how easy your heart it is to set up a
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.800]   Facebook marketing campaign
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.160]   They'd raised one and a half million dollars in funding from investors
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:09.440]   Um
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440]   We don't know how much they sold for
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.880]   In its announcement toro writes joining google will give team members access to more resources and distribution
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.120]   allowing them to continue our mission of making the lives of app developers easy
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.160]   I think they'll apply it to google sites or google properties. Don't you think
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.720]   See what else google glass news
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:36.480]   Um
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.480]   It's not dead yet
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.920]   Sounds like money python not dead yet
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.720]   Get in the get in the wagon not dead yet
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:54.880]   Google is shuffling engineers in the glass project a new team developing the new version under new leadership
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.680]   Hmm
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:07.440]   So the project graduated out of the google x uh lab into the hands of tony fidel tony of course went on to other things
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.600]   Um
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.600]   Google has been seating prototypes of google glass to glass at work partners
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.880]   Continues to approach partners. So it's not dead yet
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.440]   But there's a new fresh strategy
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.800]   And we're starting to see posts people like steven lau
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.880]   Um
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:33.920]   He was the according to this article in nine to five google the face of the secret san francisco glass foundry developers event
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.640]   Last year or two years ago
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.400]   engineer and technical lead on the glass software team for four years
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.840]   Uh, he was part of the group that built google glass and he says it's been a wild and crazy ride
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:51.040]   But after three years and eight months, I'm leaving glass to start a new episode of my career over at youtube
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.160]   Wow
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:59.200]   Jeff you don't pull your glass out anymore. Do you know you don't show your glass?
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.680]   No, i'm embarrassed. Yeah
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.640]   Jason it was my it was my it was my peak of google fan boyish foolish
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.080]   I will flick it fast
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560]   This could change the world look at everything
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.240]   It was as if it was done just to make us make fools of ourselves
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.640]   You reach peak fan boy and sinker. Oh gotcha
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.520]   You never you never got suckered in the glass kevin
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:27.120]   Actually, I did and to be honest. I buy all of my own devices
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.360]   Giggum does not reimburse me. They actually reimburse me for that and i'm kind of glad they did
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:40.160]   It's the only thing they've ever reimbursed me for 1500 bucks 1500 bucks. Oh plus I I got the special frames with prescription
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.360]   I was 20 for that but oh well
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.320]   $2,200 both done. Yeah, that it adds up
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.160]   But you know if they are seeding any type of new prototypes and such to google at work partners
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.600]   That's probably the best possible market they can work with at this point because as a consumer product
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.920]   It's just not there yet. I'm sure people want it
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:05.280]   But there are a lot of places in vertical markets where it could be handy. You know what I want right now
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:08.800]   snacks
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.440]   Get your nature box out everybody we have the new thing that we do everybody who has nature box at home

[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.760]   Nature box has given you a chance to get a free trial box of their most popular snacks. You just made
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:31.840]   Yeah, you love what no, you know, is this the pineapple? Oh, is this is different? No, it's what is the apples? It looks like the pie
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:38.400]   All of the deliciousness of the pineapple rings which are our favorites now in fuji apples too
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.880]   Crunchy or offer the latter the neat thing about nature box

[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.000]   I got a box with a crunchy rick oster though. Oh, yeah
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.760]   That's a very special prize inside
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.160]   It'd be good. They should do that a free risk rick oster low in every box
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:43.280]   Poor rick. He stated mo to roll it though. I was I was pleased to hear that because I think he's a great guy
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.280]   I think was he the one knows another guy
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:54.400]   I met at one of the mo to x events who admitted to designing. No, maybe it was rick mo to blur
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.600]   Oh
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.240]   No, that's what I said. I don't think I would have admitted that even I know that's a shocking admission
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:10.080]   I said I said I think it was rick. That's was you know, I had a droid x droid all the different horrible
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.880]   He said we had to do it because androids, you know 2.2 gingerbread
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:20.160]   Just really wasn't very good. And so we had to all of the oem's had to kind of
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.040]   Do what we could to make it a more usable operating system
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.920]   But I think I might argue that it did not improve things
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.360]   Portion. So I picked your whole product team sitting around
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.560]   So what do we want to do? Let's make it blurry
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.120]   Blurry and have all kinds of stuff keep coming on the phone using up their vegan. Very
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:44.080]   Yeah, it was I know you have to differentiate, but that wasn't the way well to be fair blur didn't actually make it blurry
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.040]   It just felt that way
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:53.520]   I mean really wasn't blurry, but this but you got to commend now with commend them under rick oster lows direction
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.520]   They are now pure as pure google as you can get in a company that isn't
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.160]   Nexus and that's how they differentiate
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.000]   It's a great way to do it
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.440]   Mobile world congress starts in a couple of days. We've got maryam jwah flying out tomorrow
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.560]   Mike elgin flying out. I think saturday
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.880]   The congress officially begins march 1st, but there's of course press conferences
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.720]   All of the big phone manufacturers have big announcements
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.000]   Maybe not monorola. I guess they've shot their wad but
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.440]   Uh, we expect to hear more about the google. I mean the uh, samsung galaxy s6
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.400]   Um looks beautiful
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:39.680]   We've all seen the teaser i'll play it one more time. You probably had it yesterday and all about android, right? Yeah, it doesn't tell you much about the phone
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.400]   Uh, it's apparently some sort of
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.560]   the flow
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.560]   liquidy
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.560]   flowing
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.560]   It's really
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.760]   Sit back get a box in nature box enjoy the ride
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   It will disappear
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.800]   Reflections will be free
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:08.400]   Colours will end
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:17.200]   The future I expect a bunch of monkey apes to be uh, it is
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.400]   Yeah, it's a phone. I can't believe how much colors will
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:27.520]   Colours will live and things will fly and it's just a phone
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.440]   Well, kevin kevin if this were the first smartphone you ever saw
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.040]   Yeah
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:41.600]   I would feel like one of the monkeys staring at the monolith I agree with you, but we've seen phones for how many years now
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.680]   And when you actually see images of the phone, this is from an xda forum
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.800]   bubble wrap
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.480]   Take it out of the bubble wrap
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:21:02.080]   Yeah, and you know, it's a gal. It's just gonna be I mean $1,100 is this is gonna be
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:06.320]   This sam is hung on a redeem itself
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.600]   I don't know kevin you cover this don't you?
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.560]   Yeah, I'm shaking my head because they've taken such a beating lately because they focus so much on the high end
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.320]   They've crammed so many features and things starting with the galaxy s4
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:23.760]   Um, you know, I'm thinking there would be three three different additions here jeff in this in terms of price
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:29.280]   Uh, you know the dual the dual display the display try display. That's try display
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:35.360]   Try display both left and right side and front, you know, so all three of your eyes can see things on the phone
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.280]   Uh, that may be very expensive. Yes because of the curved glass on both sides
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.760]   But I would imagine there's going to be a standard galaxy s6 edition that's much more reasonable on price
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:48.800]   Um, you know, I think the bigger thing here for them is to get rid of all their touch was bloatware
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:55.280]   Which remember is they halved on that also talk of microsoft apps pre-install, which is good for microsoft
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:00.240]   Uh, I like that idea. I do like that. They would not replace the google apps, right?
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.920]   They would just replace the samsung apps
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.080]   I don't think they can replace the google apps by by licensing agreement. No, right
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.440]   So that would be nice because who needs the samsung calendar the samsung anything
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.920]   Uh, the other thing that stirs me when I when I try to fix and help a friend with a samsung phone
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:21.520]   Is that it's just so off putting even even the settings. I can't find anything on it. Right. Well now
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:27.920]   Let me say this I do use a note for it's my daily driver. It is in many respects the best hardware out there
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.240]   Many would agree the best camera phone out there
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.680]   Um
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.600]   I I you know, I love the the stylus and I love the screen is there's no better looking screen at the edge
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.080]   I played with the edge for a while that does not woo me
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:47.200]   But that's a good hardware device and they to their credit samsung's backing off a little bit on touch whiz bit by bit
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.000]   if you add your own launcher and uh
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.600]   And a lollipop skin you could almost feel think you were using lollipop
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:23:01.040]   Do you see any benefit to the you know added curve? No, no, I played with the edge screen. It was crazy
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.080]   It didn't make any sense. We can make you one more can you imagine a benefit?
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.480]   I just want to show you ask is can you imagine a benefit?
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.520]   I imagine a benefit a benefit that they sold at their
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:15.040]   Announcement, which is that you're sitting in a meeting you've got the phone on the table in front of you and you can read the edge
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.720]   Except that the way they've set it up the edge is upside down that way
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.720]   Ah and there is there was no way to turn it around and I thought well wait a minute
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:28.160]   This I guess if you put the phone no, there's no way to read it
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:33.520]   You had it was like why is it upside down you're supposed to look at it like this
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.360]   That makes the other point of it was an extra navigational
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.040]   Oh, yeah, well and you can and you can have little bubbles
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.520]   Come up the side that was kind of there's like screen savers on it
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.800]   Um, it is an extra navigational so there's little icons there, but I don't find that particularly useful
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.840]   It's also one-handed. I mean if you're right or left handed
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.600]   It's gonna depend on if you can actually use the device or not well imagine now with three screens
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.760]   They want to have it wrapping around on each side
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.080]   Then you have to be what kind of hand would that be?
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.880]   I'll have the thing strapped to me sitting in front of my face and I'll use both hands to to drive on the phone
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.880]   I guess
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.400]   So
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.800]   But it's not waterproof to be oh, yes, no to be fair to be fair
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:25.440]   Miriam was telling me that she has talked to people who have seen the the trifold design and say it's surprisingly elegant and attractive
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.920]   I can all I can imagine that but you know, I told you on the show. I think last week we were foremost
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.840]   The problem I have with every phone I have including my nexus six is when I pick it up
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.360]   I've got to go through this whole you know little ballet to figure out whether it's
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.400]   Upside up right aside up or upside down
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.320]   Yeah, yeah, I mean the Samsung devices do have physical home buttons
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.840]   So it is actually easier to do that than it is on many other true true
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.560]   Um, that would be a selling point
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.640]   I know I hate the idea of a physical home button. I just think that's so pathetic
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.680]   Um here by the way from Samsung Norway
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.160]   Are some pictures the Samsung Galaxy S6 will not look like
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:10.400]   And I at least there's the Norwegians had some some some funny senses of humor about this
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.640]   They had some images
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.360]   Of uh, let me see if I can this is rumor six
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.720]   Samsung has expected release a flexible foldable phone
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.920]   How can I see the other rumors the left arrow is it the left one? Yeah, here's oh, yeah
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.520]   Here's rumor five at all glass galaxy
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.280]   These are the concept drawings you see all the time on the internet and I like them
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.240]   But they made their own it is rumored that the get next galaxy will feature a larger display
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.520]   Uh, that's a blue blueprint
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:45.600]   Uh three sides. This is the three side for the pono galaxy. It looks like a pono player
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.080]   The new galaxy is expected to be durable
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.840]   Uh
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.360]   This is one with forward-facing stereo speakers. I think that's for you kevin and your beetles collection
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:58.320]   It's the firefly edition looks like a bug to me or something
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.960]   So I like I like that they had a sense of humor about it
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.800]   Um, we'll find out we we're gonna have coverage of the samsung event the lg event the ht
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.640]   I like the m9 the new htc
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.440]   Looks nice
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.720]   Both of these will be using the snap drag actually I don't know the s6 will not be using the strap snapdragon 810
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.880]   Uh, that's an oce
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.480]   They'll be using their own a octo octo core exenos
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.920]   Um, but the m9 will be and I think many others will are you an experienced fan?
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.960]   You were you mentioned that you like the uh, ex the x three
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:37.200]   The experience the three actually like it. It's all it's completely waterproof. It's place iris audio nice camera 20.7 megapixel
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.880]   Sony sensor
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.600]   Um, it actually had the same internals as the mo do x the 2014 mo do x so it's it's not bad
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.200]   I you know
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:51.200]   It's not bad at all. It's just sony has never had the carrier support here that the other brands have so that's saying that's they're getting out of the
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.320]   Business now, right?
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.520]   Then you just talk about that. Yeah breaking that out and selling it off and getting out of that business but uh,
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:03.760]   They there was was a leaked experience z4 tablet. That's apparently coming out at mobile world congress
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.760]   So they're not completely done yet. Good
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.560]   Good. I hope so
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.280]   Pebble did announce it or a kickstarter to raise money for a new pebble watch
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.400]   Back to the well again pebble of course raised 10 million dollars was one of the first really
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.440]   successful
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:25.600]   Projects the new pebble watch. What is it at now? I'm wondering let me just
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.640]   I think it's over 10
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.640]   Is it over 10 yet?
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:36.080]   They only launched it two days ago. I wouldn't be surprised it went to three morning went to five million almost
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.240]   It's called pebble time
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.440]   Uh, yeah almost 10 there at nine point six million dollars
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.600]   And this really just shows you that people now treat kickstarter as a pre-order system
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.920]   Yeah in a marketing, uh in a dry area. Yeah
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:54.640]   Which pebble pebble was taken to task on their reddit ama today for
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.640]   Yeah, well, I kind of I see both sides to this one
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.920]   I mean, yes kickstarter shouldn't be for projects that are readily to you know ready for sale and such
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.720]   But the flip side is pebble said look, you know
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.040]   If we go to a big box store, you know, we've got to deal with their marketing and so on
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.240]   This builds buzz for us in our user base. Okay. I get that
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.840]   Also, the big box stores want a 50 profit margin on
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:26.320]   These devices and such pebble through kickstarter. They're just paying a little fee to kickstarter and the payment processing so right there in best
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.760]   pebbles in best buy they yes, yes, they are and they will be again with pebble time
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:39.200]   But they're trying to get as much bang for the buck and as much profit margin out as they can in the first 31 days with this kickstarter project
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.520]   So, yeah, I mean
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.000]   Those profits to best buy is a smart. I just my question
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.400]   You know what the real clock is what the real countdown is to the apple watch release
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.440]   They're trying to get as much of the as they can
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.080]   Right now before the apple watch is out because once it's out
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.560]   I have a feeling all the oxygen is gone from the room for every other smartwatch
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.040]   Of course, if you're an android user, what are you gonna do? You're exactly
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.960]   That's I actually backed the pebble time. I did not back the originals
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:15.440]   I got review units. I backed the pebble time because I switched between android and iOS on a weekly basis
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:18.560]   I'm gonna switch back to iOS just so I can use an apple watch
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.040]   um, I bought the original pebble on kickstarter and
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.480]   Pretty quickly gave up on it. I bought you don't you know what I did I bought it
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:34.880]   And then I I saw all the grouse in about it. I sold it for a profit on even nice job. No, but yeah
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.920]   Nice job, and that was everyone at it
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:42.240]   I gave mine a jad. He loves it. There are people who love their pebble watches
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.320]   You know, there's some
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.320]   You'd only have to charge it once a week
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.000]   Um
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.400]   This one's gonna be color the olden wasn't
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:57.440]   So we'll see mobile world congress is is I think now the most interesting show much more so than ces
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:00.960]   So we'll see a lot of good stuff coming out of there and I will look forward to
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.800]   To seeing that including probably some new android wear
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.520]   devices
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.240]   Um
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.240]   What else
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.480]   Twitter is while you're away feature. I do not like this is now on android. It was on a
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:20.800]   iOS yet Nick yet. Do I have to change the app or?
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.200]   I don't like it
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:30.720]   I don't like it one bit the idea being though see to me the thing that twitter taught us that was a valuable lesson
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.800]   Was that you don't have to read everything when I first started using twitter
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:39.520]   I tried to read everything I'd missed and pretty soon that becomes untenable and you realize quickly
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:44.560]   That's the way life is that's the way the internet is it is a stream a river of information
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.960]   You can't possibly gulp
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.280]   The entire stream so dip in and dip out and that's fine. It's okay
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.600]   You can't it's okay to miss things
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.000]   But twitter apparently has decided no
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.440]   When i'm away from twitter i'm away for a reason. I don't need to go back right
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.960]   No, why does he what people were talking about now during the osm years
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.400]   And that and that's where snapchat obviously changes the paradigm
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.080]   Right
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:14.720]   Stuff dies, but you know what i have to say i got away from doing snapchat only because i want to create stuff that people can read after 24 hours
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.560]   Yeah, I feel like it's a lot of work
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.720]   Well, I wonder if that's I was thinking about that today leo
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:25.120]   Is that kind of an old fart thing where we care about archives and file cabinets and stuff like that?
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.520]   Is is is that just an old habit of ours?
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:31.680]   I think if you're okay some content really has no shelf life
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.120]   The katie kurick's news updates on snapchat espn
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.680]   sports on
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.720]   They there's no shelf life, but I like to think the stuff that we do
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.840]   I mean, I admit it doesn't have a year shelf life
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.440]   Although tv shows i made in canada 10 years ago are still airing
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:51.120]   This i do not recommend
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.840]   But I would hope that we we consider that our shows have at least a week's shelf life
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.720]   24 just seems too short for me
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.480]   Especially if i'm gonna put some effort into you know creating a video and stuff like that. I don't know
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:07.040]   So tomorrow's the big day
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:14.240]   Uh, it's okay. I finally figured out what we're talking about the net neutrality thing the fcc commissioners will gather
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.280]   And we'll vote
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:24.000]   Uh, it is expected certainly the proposal in front of them is that the fcc adopt title to regulation of broadband providers
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.440]   Making them a utility allowing the fcc see the real problem has been
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.440]   That con you know congress didn't give fcc explicit
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:38.720]   Control over internet service providers the fcc tried to implement open internet rules
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:47.200]   Verizon sued and won and the court told the fcc no vorizons right you don't have a mandate from congress to do this unless
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:53.280]   You do it if you invoke title to
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.120]   The telecommunications act and say that they are common carriers
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.720]   Then you would they the judge clearly in this decision the judges really clearly said
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:10.960]   Title two and uh tom weiler fought it back and forth now for a long time. I thought wow. This is great. Tom weiler is listening to the people
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.920]   And then I realized
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.680]   It says nothing to do with the people
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.120]   This has everything to do with which lobbyists brought the biggest chunk of change to the table
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:27.280]   And so for a long time the cable companies the wireless companies ruled the roost
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.800]   Then google and facebook and microsoft
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:36.720]   Decided some years ago to hire their own lobbyists and get in there and this all this shows
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.760]   Is a changing of the guard in washington dc politics?
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:47.760]   The money is now coming from silicon valley in greater amounts than it's coming from the broadband providers
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   You don't think the political pressure of
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.600]   Not the people of
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.520]   Nothing nothing no impact all I really I had an epiphany yesterday
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.280]   I realized because there new york times had a great article on how
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:09.200]   The big internet companies had lobbied for this and that's really and well, but others like like uh was a free press and eff and mozilla
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.200]   And others I think had some objections to that because there was a hey we had a role
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:20.400]   For stating their role. I know that we're I mean there were five million comments to the fcc
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.320]   Yeah, um there were a lot of love the part. I didn't know about this the 30
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:30.000]   30 top fcc executives our officials got got 50,000 phone calls
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.760]   Awesome that their direct numbers were were
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.280]   Hacked and found awesome. Yeah
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:45.040]   Uh, I also see which is very interesting a concerted effort from uh conservatives
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:51.440]   Uh including rush limbaugh and others to fight this to say whoa hold on there, but they're a little late
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.200]   I think they missed the boat. Well, that's gonna be it'll be fought in court now
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.880]   Well, of course for us in in at ates already prepared its brief
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:05.120]   Now you saw I don't know if you saw I added this to the rundown right before that now google the 11th hour
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.920]   Is trying to uh get a change in the regulation. Yeah
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.680]   What do they want?
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.480]   I think what I think the way I read it and I could be wrong here
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.240]   I need you to read this and see
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.920]   I think basically what they're saying is the peer to peer charges made to the likes of google and netflix are not neutral
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.960]   So they're trying to go not just from the front end consumer
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.360]   And to define neutrality, but also at the back end to define neutrality
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.960]   I think the other look I would love to help you with the articles on the financial times
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.640]   Which are behind a paywall and since I am not a subscriber. I cannot read this article on mine. I just had to answer a um
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.120]   survey question when I was in uh
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.040]   survey says
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.040]   Um, it's like boxers or texts
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:48.000]   Google enter your email address
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.680]   Select an access level well, uh free
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.920]   Uh
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:59.600]   If you if you register you get you get some number of you get house of bill plus selected blogs. You don't get the news
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:03.600]   I have the minimum of 645 a week
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.160]   and
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.200]   A lot here
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.600]   Sign up for quick access to three articles per month
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:14.400]   Three per month. I don't want to even give them my information screws them
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.680]   I'm not going to read their articles or but they put it behind a big old brick wall
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]   Google um
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:28.320]   In its filing google said the regulator risked encouraging broadband providers to try to charge companies such as google and Netflix for sending
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:34.720]   Content through their pipes while the same broad broadband groups already charged retail customers for internet access
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.880]   Does that sound like a appearing issue
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:42.080]   Such an outcome would defeat the purpose of net neutrality rules google said in the ft
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.440]   Its effort has revealed cracks and silicon bellies support
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.280]   Think what this shows remember google kind of held back lobbying on this yes
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:52.960]   Uh, although you could probably say they let their packs do it
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.960]   You know, they kind of they let the companies do it a little bit more anonymously
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.120]   But I think what this is about is the so-called forbearance provisions
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:04.000]   One of the things people were very worried about with title two
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.760]   I myself included is that it does allow the fcc to do things we don't want it to do like for instance
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.280]   Uh set prices and charge which which yes, you see said they won't do and so there's a doctor
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:22.640]   Called forbearance which the president proposed that the fcc adopt the fcc agreed to that says we're going to enforce these but not those
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:27.600]   We're going to choose here and not there one of the items I remember in the forbearance was this peering stuff
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.760]   That we won't mess in this workable. Well, so so the the key paragraph
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:38.800]   Uh in explanation net neutrality centers on the ability of broadband providers to control video streaming other content deliver to consumer screens
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:45.200]   But google's lobbying is about a different set of relationships the informal back end links between broad brand providers and
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.960]   Content providers and that's the net that's the netflix cogent
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.160]   Siree is like google is trying to say
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.240]   Well, okay. What that what this is we're winning. Let's let's go the next step
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.560]   Well google doesn't want
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.680]   Isp's like Comcast to charge it for access to me. No, exactly, but it also doesn't want
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.400]   YouTube is the bit I would guess is a big one. Yes, it doesn't want youtube
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.760]   uh to have to it wants to make deals with let's say cogent or
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.400]   Comcast to have access to the network or to have appropriate peering
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.320]   I consider that all part of fast lane. I'm not sure exactly
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:31.120]   Um what they're talking about here. I think well, yeah, and but here's the odd thing about it. So so austin schlich google's director of communications law
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.920]   Um
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:38.960]   Talked about this is a practice of double recovery that could do serious long-term harvard the virtual circle of internet innovation
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:44.560]   blah blah blah right right then a lobbyist for another big silicon valley group
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.920]   Said quote here. You see that google is not a big supporter of net neutrality everyone thinks it is
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:56.400]   Well, they're what they're trying to just make it even more neutral where you can't charge anybody for anything special
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:02.560]   So complicated frankly it is that I don't think anybody understands it including the FCC
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.440]   I think that's one of the reasons big money wins
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.880]   Because they know that the public really doesn't have any idea what's going on
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:15.280]   I think what's really interesting to me also is how the tone has shifted once the right wing demagogues
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:21.200]   Started to wait like glen back and shawn hannity and rush limber start weighing in on this they
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:25.440]   Really galvanized their base and all of a sudden
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.240]   Even in our chat room, which was once very strongly in favor of title two people are
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:38.160]   Horrified by the notion including mark care including mark cuban horrified about the notion of title two regulation
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:41.520]   It's a mess
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:48.000]   It is, but you know, I still think this leo I still think that the telcos and cable companies brought it on themselves
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.320]   Absolutely
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:56.960]   If they hadn't tried to screw us this wouldn't have been an issue the reason this is an issue is because you greedy bastards
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.400]   Tried to nickel and dimas make us think you're your prisoners
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.320]   Uh in a case where there wasn't competition you went overboard power corrupts absolute power corrupts
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.600]   Absolutely monopoly is corrupt and and you did it to yourselves
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.680]   If you had if you had come up with your own standards of decent behavior
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:19.920]   Long ago and held to them and given us decent service without this kind of crap. This wouldn't have happened
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:27.040]   It came up only because you're a holes. I agree and some who blame the FCC for creating the duopoly
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.120]   We have ignore the fact that they were pressured into it by the big cable companies in the
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:35.200]   Uh and the telephone companies who said well in that case we're not going to invest
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.960]   And so you'll notice that the in the language chairman wheeler has used he's he's very much trying to have it both ways
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:45.920]   Well, we want to make sure there's incentive for the broadband providers to invest we'll make sure that they can make money
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.200]   But we also want to make sure that of the o internet is not
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.560]   Uh divided up into you know fast lanes and the best internet goes to the highest bidder
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.200]   Content creator and I agree with that
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.600]   um
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.520]   The next day I'll wait for the other thing that he suggested and I think this is really good
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.000]   And I see good movement from the FCC on this is that there should be competition
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.400]   I think that ultimately that's the only real solution
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.280]   Amen
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.840]   And he one of the things he said is we're going to stop
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:19.360]   We're going to stop these companies from from getting state legislatures to block municipal Wi-Fi
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:22.320]   And that's a I think that's a huge part of it
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.960]   We've talked about that before just sounds like
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:27.440]   Apparently I say chat an ooga
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.920]   And that's not how you say it's just chat an ooga
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:38.400]   But anyway chat an ooga in chat. I know it's balmer, but apparently it's chad nuga in chat nuga. They have a very good very successful gigabit
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:41.360]   municipal internet access
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:48.480]   And this is the kind of thing that cities could foster that would create competition and be very it would solve the problem
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.600]   We'll have to wait. I also have a link. I know what this means for a while
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.200]   Frankly. I also have a link up on the rundown that google has now said to cities
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.760]   um
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:04.480]   Treat us better, you know be get rid of your stupidity and you can attract us
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.320]   For fiber. Yeah, but if you don't make a mess for us
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:11.680]   But the first thing I said is get rid of your fax machines
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.400]   For all this regulatory bs. Yeah, come on people
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:19.920]   I love that story
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.400]   Isn't that great?
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.840]   I also love that there's a Verizon ad there on the uh, yeah, google fiber story. Oh, yeah, right there on google
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:32.800]   Who is that straight? We'll give you files. Yeah. Yeah, we'll give you files. I like jeff chonron. I also
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.000]   We're gonna take a break when we come back
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.280]   Uh, I don't know if they uh warned you kevin. We'd like to do a tip or something
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:45.360]   Something I planned ahead a uh, you know the greatest Beatles album of all time anything like that
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:52.000]   Are there any great Beatles apps like you know, there's we just talked uh on tuesday about
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.440]   Beethoven's I think it's Beethoven's ninth there's or is it the fifth there was a beautiful ipad app with the
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.760]   Is there anything like that for the Beatles?
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.800]   You know, I can't I can't think of when I thought ringo actually did a photography book that was kind of part book part app for the ipad
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.040]   It didn't come out and print at all
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:12.640]   You have to be a hardcore Beatles fan. I really want that. Yeah. Yeah
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.800]   All I know is in your face is a photograph
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.800]   um
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.120]   No, but it's a has a rights thing and this is where this is where it's unfortunate
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:30.480]   The Beatles I think uh whoever owns a Beatles catalog. I don't know even know anymore. It's not michael jackson. That was it
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:37.280]   He used to I don't I don't think yo go gods has some say in that anyway, I don't have any of it. I can tell you that I know
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.600]   They really need to let go
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.200]   Make the Beatles public domain at this point. Have you not made enough money yet?
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.760]   Let it be let it be
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.040]   imagine
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.160]   a world
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.160]   Where the Beatles music would flow freely
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:54.720]   Probably disney owns it somebody says in the chair probably right
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.680]   Ultimately disney owns everything don't they
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:04.080]   You know, they don't own they don't own my ink jet cartridges my toner cartridges

[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.680]   Jeff Jarvis should we start with maybe we'll start with kevin he can do a tip or a
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.720]   Product and then you can do a number and I've got something for you
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:47.280]   Sure sure I can do that. Um, I was gonna my thing was going to be little mini
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.800]   We've been getting so much mile out of that
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:00.320]   So, uh, here's a tip that I actually found through somebody on google plus if you're on google plus
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:07.120]   I highly recommend you follow this person. He is a google evangelist. His name is fran sua bo for he is based in france
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.400]   Uh, and he puts out all kinds of tips tricks about what's coming up in chrome oas and chrome and so on
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:17.200]   And today he said here's how you can add a reader mode to chrome on your desktop
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.520]   There's a secret switch that you can use now
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.720]   I've used uh, ever know it's clearly to do this
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.960]   But it'd be nice to have this natively in chrome and you can do that
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.920]   Basically by reader mode. We made stripping out all of the you know, superfluous stuff
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.920]   The ads the pictures the photos the the junk and get you right to the content
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.720]   So, uh, it's something I think every browser should really have
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.960]   And uh, it's nice that you can do this. It is an experimental switch however
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.640]   So the instructions are on france was google plus post maybe we can put a link in the show notes for that
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.320]   Good we will super yeah
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.600]   frass wah fr a n c o i s
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.720]   Be a u f o r t just like it sounds
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.280]   And uh, he uh, I've just circled him in google
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:08.320]   He is uh, this is great and you can just find this in his google plus right?
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.800]   Yes, he's constantly putting great tips and tricks and all kinds of new features for the dev channel and such in chrome
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:17.360]   Right in there so you can try them neat stuff
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.560]   Wow
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:26.480]   Look at all this this is juicy. It's it's all chrome stuff juicy stuff. Mm-hmm behind the scenes
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.600]   He's it's like he's a chrome paparazzi, you know
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.960]   Thank you kevin
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.760]   By the way, always great to have you. I just think the world is you find kevin at giga ohm.com
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.960]   And uh, now that I know he's a Beatles fanatic. We're gonna have some nice conversations
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.520]   I'll show you that tattoo next time is it what part of your body is it on?
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:53.680]   Upper right shoulder. Oh, okay. And is it the just the Beatles like that? Yeah, it's the Beatles drop down too. Yep
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.960]   Oh, man. I just fell in love with those four lads all over again reading that tune in book all these years
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:04.880]   Man, that's a big read it's a long-ass book. I'm listening to it. I'm not only long
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:08.960]   But you know just the I mean ringo hasn't joined the band yet
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.640]   They still have peep best. They haven't fired peep best yet. You get a ways to go. Oh, I know
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.480]   Well, I hear the first volume ends before their first record deal
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.080]   It's crazy
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.880]   There's this is mark lewinson that we're talking about as the author here
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:28.400]   And he I said this before the show he is probably the most knowledgeable Beatles person on the planet
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.480]   That is alive right now. And yeah, it's not written like a fanboy's writing it
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.080]   It's written like just a biography a great biography
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:42.800]   Um, and you just get the voices you hear it's nice on audible because the reader does all the liver pool accents and stuff and
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:47.840]   You can you can if you read this book you will know what the cavern club smelled like
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.280]   That you can I could smell it as i'm reading that description of it's amazing
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:59.760]   What a great good. Yeah, I agree. I'm glad to hear that somebody who's like a serious beetle expert agrees
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.280]   I just I thought it was great. It is a big book
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.720]   I mean, I don't know 47 hours or something
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.680]   That's how I measure books
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:12.800]   Rich that's high
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.280]   I
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:17.280]   Jeff
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.960]   Jeff, uh, you have a number for us. Hi. Hi. Hi. How are you doing? Hi? Hey, um
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:25.680]   I'm two of them
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:28.640]   So the first I was you know the google lunar x prize
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:34.640]   Get to the moon earn 20 million dollars spend 80 million dollars to get there but yeah, um
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:40.000]   So as you know that you you have to not only land on the you have to step you have to land you get
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.800]   You know get out of earth orbit. You have to get on the moon. You have to land something and then you have to travel
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.040]   I think it's five hundred you know
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:52.560]   500 meters. Yeah, uh honor above or below the surface and then send back
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:59.680]   Hetv video signaled earth. Yeah, so what's happened here? I love this there are three of the competing teams
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.400]   uh or two of the teams
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:07.520]   Have agreed to share a ride to the moon and then when they land
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:14.160]   Their rovers will have a race and whoever does the 500 meters and sends back the civil first is going to win 20 million dollars
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.000]   What 20 million
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.440]   20 million
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.560]   Do you think it'll be like close like they'll be within feet of each other? No
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.560]   Well, the great thing is it'll be it'll be like that great
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.120]   George Costanza being chased
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:28.320]   in uh in uh in Seinfeld
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:34.640]   Right, it'll probably be in your hearts. Yeah little tiny slow things going. Yeah, he's writing this rascal down the street
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:40.400]   Yeah, because they probably don't go very far fast. No. Yeah, it might take a couple of days to go 5,000 feet
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:43.680]   One of them might you know do a bouncing trick or something like that. I don't know
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:46.880]   So I have one other number which I enjoyed so
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:49.760]   Google a company that it bought
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:54.720]   Uh has created the machine that taught itself how to play and win at 49
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:00.800]   Classic games, which means people that we finally invented the machine that can waste its own time
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.240]   Wait a minute. Wait, I want to what that tell what that want this
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:11.200]   This is a machine that can teach itself is an aisles software. It's a AI
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.640]   That gets adept at playing 49 retro games and comes up with his own winning strategies
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:22.560]   Interesting. Shall we play a game? I think that's what wapper did, isn't it?
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:26.640]   I don't I don't remember the touring test having anything to do with video games with vlog
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:32.880]   Deep it's deep mind. That's the British company. They they bought as I remember the terrain test
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:39.360]   You have to convince someone you're a teenage boy. So what else what better to do than games? There you go. Yeah, yeah, bring your own quarters. Yep
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:42.240]   so uh
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:48.080]   Deep deep blue, which is the chess playing computer actually had to be taught how to play chess, but deep mind
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.640]   learns on its own
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.640]   Here it's a tari breakout, right?
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.640]   Now come on deep mind. You know the best thing to do. That's it. Get in the back. Oh, I love that
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.640]   It goes and goes and goes
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:03.760]   Think of the xbox one achievement points. I can get with this. Oh, man. Actually, it's quite good
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:08.320]   But of course the computer is good at this. That's the whole point. Yes, of course. It can never miss
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:11.120]   I mean really
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:16.000]   It's got better reflex side track there kind of knows where that little balls can it knows where it's going?
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]   It's talking to its brother computer
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.320]   By the way, they cut that video short
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.240]   I'm wondering
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:24.240]   Did it win or did it lose?
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.120]   It's still playing
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:32.160]   It never ends. I played so much breakout. I can actually hear the sound of that ball
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:34.800]   going
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.240]   So you were talking about a clean reading mode in chrome. This is for mobile. It's called flinks
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:48.320]   And I think it's very interesting. This is for android. They were in a public beta for a long time. It's now out
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:52.160]   um, it allows you to modify
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.560]   uh
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.760]   your
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:58.880]   Default browser on here, although you don't have to to use it
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:04.800]   It's kind of like pocket in that it can save articles out and it saves them without ads, which is awfully nice
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.880]   although i'm sure the
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:08.880]   creators with the blogs won't be
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:13.520]   Uh too happy to hear that and it does the saving in the background so you can continue browsing
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.000]   I've had it set up for instance to use twitter
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.800]   So if I see a link on twitter, in fact, that's what he's going to do right now
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:23.200]   When he opens that link on twitter the flinks bubble pops up he continues to browse twitter
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:25.520]   But flinks meanwhile is saving that article
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:32.480]   To the browser the flinks browser, which he'll then be able to go to and read it in a clean formatted
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:35.520]   fashion kind of a medium style read
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:38.080]   Uh on the phone
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.080]   So I I thought this was kind of a nice little app. I think it's free
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.080]   fly
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.080]   nx for android
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.040]   um
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.200]   And uh, I like it a lot. I don't have you guys tried flinks
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:58.960]   Nope ring a bell. I have not saw this uh pocket user, but yeah, I use pocket like crazy
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:06.240]   Um, and I don't know if this would eliminate the need for pocket because it does it does allow you to do sharing outside
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:11.920]   So you could continue to share it a pocket if uh if you want afterwards. So it's really more I I use it more
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:15.840]   Not like pocket, which is let's me read everything late at the end of the week
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:20.320]   I use it more to kind of in a get in a news gathering mode on the on the device
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:27.680]   In that single session so you save it all out and then you go and you can read it and then continue to share it back to pocket or whatever you want
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:30.160]   um, I actually share to a
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:35.840]   Pinboard most of the time because that's where our links come from for our show. I just thought it would be worth taking a look at
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:39.280]   I also have to say with my early impressions on the mo doe
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.640]   If you have somebody you don't want to you want to get them an android device
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.960]   You don't want to spend a lot of money or if you're a google developer
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.760]   An android developer who does not want to spend six or seven hundred bucks for an xs six
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.840]   This is a pure google experience that would be uh perfect for that in 150 bucks. I'm very impressed
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:58.480]   just with the first day of
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.960]   using this
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:05.120]   Amazing what you can do for 150 bucks these days. This is the new second generation
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.600]   Moto e which both kevin and I got along with our little paper
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:15.440]   Rick australow in the mail this morning. So so the the advances in phones really
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:20.240]   Are not in new features and new things because they've kind of none has been terribly new
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.360]   It's it's going to be in getting it cheaper and cheaper and cheaper
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:26.240]   Battery better and better and better. No
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:31.680]   I think there's other place. It was like the the crumbok in the conversation we had
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:35.760]   Yeah, that's your other place. You can you can have high-end, but there's only so far you can go
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.960]   Now that's why watches. I think there's more things. That's why watch this. Yeah, that's where wearables
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:44.000]   Yeah, but I you know my theory. I keep on saying on the shows
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.280]   I think that the the phone itself is going to be an accessory
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:54.720]   To to a computer that you you just constantly have that that it itself then communicates with all kinds of screens and devices and all kinds of things
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:00.240]   That you wanted to happen. Well, I finally got my order in for the amazon echo
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:03.120]   Um having played with it now
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:11.440]   Um that have you this do I ask for it and I haven't gotten the invitation to buy I got mine check your email because I'm almost missed it
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:14.320]   They said you know you only had 24 more hours to order it. Well, you're kidding
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:20.000]   I got the $99 prime deal right you can or uh so but I played with Mike Mike Elkins
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.320]   Actually, it was it's tony nelson who lent it to not tony anthony
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:26.160]   Anthony
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:30.240]   Nielsen who lent it to mike algens, but I was so impressed. I just love it
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.120]   It's like a little buddy in your house that you could talk to
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:37.200]   If we could just make little rich osterlo talk like that
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.920]   Chip are getting smaller. I mean you can fit one in here pretty soon. I think I think
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:45.840]   But in his back pocket. I think in all seriousness though
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:51.760]   Uh, that's where you can go internet of things and stuff and maybe you say a central computer
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:54.880]   That's running the whole thing. There's no reason why that central computer couldn't fit in your pocket
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:58.240]   Doesn't have to be a desktop
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:03.600]   Just test it's all about uh, it's all about interface. That's why the echoes kind of need
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:06.800]   Dr. M says the novelty wears off. Oh geez
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:08.480]   She's such a
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:13.840]   Boil sport so my amazon echo purchased expired on january 13th see you didn't see the invite
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:21.280]   Isane I signed into amazon. I'm on amazon literally every day. Why did they say on the amazon site?
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.680]   Hf want to buy this I almost missed it too
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.200]   Oh, it's even worse than that because when you first go to the page
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.440]   They say it's 199 dollars and it's only after you put it in your cart that you see that they gave you the discount
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:35.120]   Oh, this pisses me off this really pisses me off. I'll send you mine
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.840]   No, I don't I don't really want it
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:44.080]   Take that amazon. I don't really want it, you know, I was curious about it 99 ducks
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:46.640]   I thought I'd play with it. You know talk about the show and that kind of stuff, but
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:51.200]   I mean it's not worth 200 of me. I don't think do you have it
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.840]   Not yet. I only played with mics
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:56.640]   Yeah, and we we had one it under review at giga ohm
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:01.200]   And I decided to pass on it when my invite came because it's really google now does a lot of the same stuff
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.480]   Same right so I didn't I decided not to accept the the deal and order it
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.720]   I'm kind of glad I didn't not just because of the money
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:13.280]   But I received my invite in january and they said I would get the device in may or june
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:16.080]   Yeah, mine says it'll lie, but I don't know if that's real
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:22.880]   Oh, I think that's real because I think they're only producing as many as they really have demand for because this is not
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:26.960]   That let's put it this way after the fire phone. I think they're they're hedging their bets here
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:31.760]   Maybe no, I want to have it in the classroom so I can I can turn to it like we do to the chat room and say
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:35.440]   Hey echo give me the answer to that tough question. I think it'd be cool
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.680]   Yeah, we'll just put a google phone there. That's always listening and say okay google
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:41.680]   But it doesn't have the same speaker
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:46.880]   I just want that actually frankly I just want sonos to integrate it into their sonos and then i'll be happy
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:50.640]   And I could say okay play the Beatles Alexa
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:55.040]   I didn't say it the right way because I know that there are many people watching
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:57.760]   Who would now be listening to Beatles music instead of us?
[01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:03.040]   It is a good thing. It is the ideal podcast player by the way, you know, you could just say the name of the podcast
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.120]   Okay, I want to listen to this and it will do it
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:08.640]   Awesome
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:13.280]   Mr kevin toffle you're the greatest. What do you want to plug plug something?
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:15.520]   Plug something um
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:17.360]   Well, you can uh, what can I plug?
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:24.400]   I write about all my mobile stuff over at gig om.com and do a chrome show once a week with my friend yanko rutkers there
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:29.280]   Everybody should listen that I love yanko. Yeah, yanko is a fantastic fantastic guy
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.440]   And calm yanko just to bother him yanko. I I like your chain
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:39.040]   Uh, we've it we've actually to tell you this is kind of funny. We've actually been doing the chrome show podcast
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:45.440]   It'll be two years in april. I can't believe we can sit there weekly and talk about nothing but chrome chrome books and so on
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:50.320]   It's correct what we do dude. You're talking to the wrong guy. I do 30 hours a week. Oh, I hear you
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:56.800]   That that's your main gig. This is my back. Oh, I do. I don't have to write any of this down
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:00.080]   That's to me a real virtue. I just talked my way through it
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.920]   Yeah, it works. I was on um, Neil degrasse Tyson, you know has his star talk podcast you were on that
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.760]   No, I'll better than that. He has a new national geographic tv show
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.200]   Yeah, so I taped that the other night. It's always really cool to be able to grow up to it was you know, it was great
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.560]   You were with him
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.560]   Yeah, we are on for an hour next time would you ask if he'll give us an interview
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:26.560]   I told him all about uh, did you? Oh good. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, because because you know, I said, I'm delighted
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.760]   I was I told this whole crew about twit. Oh good. Thank you

[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:49.280]   But but it's kind of cool too that I hope it doesn't get corrupted. It's now going to be a tv show on that geo so they did 10 episodes
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.440]   And I was not it was kind of cool to see the reverse happen. They're pat by, you know, a podcast podcast to mainstream
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:02.160]   Yeah, yeah, so waiting for that call from the national geographic folks, but someday well, they should I was talking to them about you
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:05.760]   I don't want I really was I don't want to and saying I was also looking at the structure
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:12.320]   They had and and you know, they had cameras on on tracks and dollies and all those stuff and go go visit twit
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:14.640]   To visit twit. Yep. We are

[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.760]   I don't have to forget. I said anything
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:22.960]   What I have to I actually do not know what our we're changing schedule in march first
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:25.760]   And I do not even know what the new schedule is
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.200]   So let me check to see some shows are changing

[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:54.800]   And getting away from the other shows. I don't know how that happens
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:05:01.440]   So what's happening with windows is moving the windows is staying the same everything's staying the same
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:04.000]   Wednesday is not changing
