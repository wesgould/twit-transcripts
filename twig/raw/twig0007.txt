[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.960]   It's time to talk about all things Google joining us right
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.880]   now as always the wonderful, the talented Jeff Jarvis of buzz
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.080]   machine.com.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.160]   Hi, Jeff.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.720]   Howdy.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.800]   With the tip of the hat to Jake, who got your sound working.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   Without him, I'm nothing.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.480]   Is Jake-- Jake's his junior or a senior?
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.480]   He's the senior now.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.080]   So this is the big-- I know my senior,
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.720]   this is the big push right now for college stuff.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.880]   We're through the midst of all that.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.400]   He's about to go out and see more colleges.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.040]   He spent the summer at Carnegie Mellon.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.880]   Wow.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.280]   He's this?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.960]   And I'm going to look at a few more.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.600]   Do you think CMU is in his future?
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.200]   I think it's a good shot.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.640]   It's a great computer science.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.880]   I think I'm sure you're going through now too of early decision
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.440]   and where do you put all your eggs?
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.200]   Right.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.400]   Yeah, I think Abby wants to do early decision at Brown.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.720]   That's-- oh, that's a great one.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.760]   Yeah, if she can get in.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.920]   GQ just named it the deuceiest campus in America.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.400]   Which if you ask me is really a recommendation.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.080]   Yeah, that's a good thing.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.160]   If GQ hates you, you're set.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.680]   Also, with this for the first time,
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.720]   and we're really glad to have him,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.320]   Gina is taking the week off because I think she's got a move.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.600]   She's involved in moving right now.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.320]   But she's nominated an excellent replacement.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.920]   Somebody who's already replaced her once,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.800]   the editor-in-chief of Life Hacker, Adam.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.360]   Pass.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.840]   She's with us.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.800]   Hi, Adam.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.880]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.840]   Great to have you.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.200]   How long ago did you take over the reins at Life Hacker?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   Well, I've been working at Life Hacker
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.400]   since November of 2005, kind of side by side with Gina.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.920]   Obviously, she was always in the driver's seat.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.760]   I took over for her in January of this year.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.440]   Great.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.840]   And how's that been?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.720]   It's been great.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.200]   Life Hacker has maintained its excellent quality.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   In fact, if anything, you've added more content,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.040]   and it's really grown nicely.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.280]   I really love it.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.880]   Thank you.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.440]   In fact, we find ourselves frequently
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.840]   linking to Life Hacker in all of our shows,
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   but especially in this week in Google.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.040]   Awesome.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.520]   So is Google 10 years old or 11 years old or what?
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.440]   That's, I guess, we should resolve this before we go any further.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.120]   It's 11 if you look at their formal business filing,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.080]   but they don't count that as an anniversary.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.440]   They did that on September 7th, 11 years ago.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.720]   Right.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.560]   That's my understanding.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   And they're saying that, no, really, it's the 27th
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.200]   when Google went online.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.360]   That's when--
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.400]   Well, but they were online before they're--
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.920]   I don't know.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.320]   It's all very confusing.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.760]   Well, anyway--
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.720]   They're still young.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.520]   Happy birthday month to Google.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.600]   In honor, they celebrated by doing something very important,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   very significant.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.680]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640]   They increased the size of the search box.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.040]   Well, as you get older, your eyesight goes.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.520]   So of course, you have to make all the type bigger.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.480]   I also saw immediately there was a grease monkey
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.880]   stripped to make it smaller again.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.520]   Inevitably.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.960]   Bigger, wider, bigger, taller, bigger what?
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   It doesn't look different to me, but I'm--
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.920]   But I guess I'm not just not that sophisticated.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.800]   The text inside, I believe, is larger.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.440]   And I think the text box itself is a touch larger.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.400]   But I actually went to it this morning
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.000]   and tried typing in it.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.440]   And it didn't look bigger.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.400]   So I don't know if this is one of those slow Google rollouts
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.640]   or I'm just crazy because I'm not seeing any difference
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.960]   on my google.com search.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.680]   It just shows you how psychological it is,
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.720]   because it's looking bigger to me.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.840]   But now I'm thinking, well, is it really bigger?
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.920]   I don't know.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.400]   I can't even--
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.480]   Plus, they also increase the type size when you type in it
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   and when it gives you presumptive links back.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.240]   Yeah, actually, I'm seeing larger now.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.440]   I just went-- and it's definitely bigger.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.160]   It feels bigger.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.960]   Well, it's bigger than certainly the type in the upper left
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.160]   hand corner that gives you the other choices.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.440]   Yeah, and they've actually--
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.600]   the buttons have changed in look and size a little bit
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.920]   to the Google search and the app.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.960]   I'm feeling lucky.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.320]   This is very exciting stuff.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.640]   Marissa Meyer wrote a whole blog post about it.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   Of course, this is her job.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.360]   Oh, I'm excited they are.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.240]   We're so excited.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   I guess things are getting pretty quiet at Google these days.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.360]   We're so excited.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.640]   Oh, look, everybody.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.200]   Now, quick, don't look-- everybody
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.120]   look away from the Google site.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.760]   Don't look at it.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.160]   Don't look at the search box.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.120]   And see if you can answer this question from who
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.000]   wants to be a millionaire.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.680]   Did you see this?
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.920]   There was a question on who wants to be a millionaire.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.440]   And it was about the colors in the Google logo.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.160]   And let me see if I can find the exact question,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.440]   so I can see how smart you are.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.240]   I actually got this right, but I think it was mostly
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.200]   because I guessed.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.160]   Here's the question.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.120]   This was on August 17th.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.360]   Which of the following is a true statement
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   about the letters in the standard Google logo?
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.040]   A, both O's are yellow.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.880]   Don't look.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.880]   Both O's are yellow.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.440]   B, both G's are blue.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.040]   C, the L is red.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.760]   Or D, the E is green.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.280]   Now, since I don't usually visit the Google front page,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.400]   I think I'm in a disadvantage.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.960]   Adam, do you know?
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   I'm going to say C.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.800]   You're probably going to say--
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.760]   You're probably going to say--
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.960]   C, final answer.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.400]   Final answer C, the L is red.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.920]   No, it's not.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.120]   No, it's not.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.320]   Now they're looking--
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.480]   It's no, both G's are blue.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.040]   Both G's are blue.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.760]   I guess that makes sense with their--
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.200]   Yeah, but that's a tough.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.040]   I hope that-- I hope the woman won a million bucks
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.360]   if she got it right.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.560]   Isn't that funny how you could stare at something day in,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.040]   day out for years, 11 years, and not know?
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.680]   And, you know, it's--
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.040]   Logoscope also put up a link.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.480]   I put it up on the friend feed of the changes
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.800]   in the search results page over the last five years.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   And they have images side by side.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.160]   And you've really got to be anal to figure it out.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.640]   So what are the changes?
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   How has it been?
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.440]   The ad box changed its background color from blue to yellow.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.240]   One assumes that made them about $1 billion.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.040]   It probably did, though, right?
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   I mean, it probably did.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.840]   That's exactly that.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.240]   So the reason they'll do things, right?
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.040]   The logo there got smaller.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.240]   Yeah, the logo is smaller.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.440]   Look at that.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.640]   Search box, search button.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.840]   On the other hand, got bigger.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.240]   The blue bar changes color.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.840]   It is brighter now.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   I remember, Marissa has written about that,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.240]   about how they will look at 40 blues and test every single blue
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   and AB tests.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   And so this is the perfect blue.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.640]   The result with is restricted to a maximum.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.440]   The phrase "similar pages" has been shortened to "similar."
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.240]   Google does not show the file size anymore for every page.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.440]   I think it's a tribute to bandwidth in America.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   The text sponsored links to the right hand
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.040]   is left to line, not centered, at other billion dollars.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.640]   Let's see.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.040]   The link to the definitions of your search words
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.640]   is pointing to answers.com and standard dictionary.com.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   That's probably a business deal.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.240]   That is.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.240]   Isn't that interesting that when you're this big
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   and there are this many, I don't know how many,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.240]   billions of searches a day,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   something so, so, so tiny could probably make a huge difference in revenue.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   And Google is ruled by metrics and testing and data wins
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.840]   and they think data is not political.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.040]   That data, that's a very good point.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.240]   Data has no agenda.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.840]   Data's data.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   There's no spin in the data.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   Wow.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   I feel manipulated.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   Or you should feel served.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.840]   Also, another story, Google is going solar.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   The Google's always been focused on how much energy they use.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   They're very clear about how much energy they use.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   They want to do, they want to be green.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   I think so.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Right.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   Google has those verdicts.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   Google has those verdicts to plug in hybrids,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   plugging into their own solar panels on campus.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   This latest story is that they want to invent mirrors for solar farms
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   that are, I think, four times more efficient.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   Because that would reduce the cost to them.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   Now, I think solar power, solar power to them,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   I think the story said was like 18 cents a kilowatt hour
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   and they want to get everything cheaper than coal,
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.840]   which I think was about 8 cents a kilowatt hour.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   Huh.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   We're going to talk and just go ahead, Adam.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.840]   Sorry, you guys know, and Google,
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.840]   they've got goats mowing their lawns, right?
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   I had goats mowing my lawn.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   I actually did this first.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.840]   I did it before Google did it.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   We had two acres and I didn't want to mow it.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   It wasn't a green thing.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   I just didn't want to have to sit on my riding mower all day,
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   every day.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   So we got goats, but I'm sure Google has learned this because goats,
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.840]   you know, in fact, there are people in a mine deck of the woods who
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   will rent a herd of goats to eat your poison oak and other weeds
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   that you don't want.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   You can't get rid of the goats to lead anything.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   But I didn't, here's the key.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   And I hope that this is just a tip for a Sergey and the gang.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   Don't feed the goats.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   The goats need to be hungry for this to work.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   My wife would buy bales of alfalfa and the goats,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.840]   they said, what do you mean?
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   We're not eating grass.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   We got alfalfa.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   They never ate any grass at all.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   Did you own them?
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.840]   Were they?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   Yeah, we own goats.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   And the problem with goats, yeah, we named them.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   What were they?
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   It was a daisy and I can't remember their names.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   What was something one would be John Deere?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   No, I had a John Deere.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   I had a John Deere.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   So we ended up, because the goats are too smart.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   The goats, goats get out.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   They get in problems.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   They come in the house.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   They climb on top of your car.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   They like to be, well, they like to be in the highest spot.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   They're mountain goats, you know, they're mountain dwellers.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   So we ended up trading them in for sheep.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   The sheep didn't eat the grass either, by the way.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   I could see Larry and Sergey going through this exact thing.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   Yo, goats!
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   Data test.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   You just go get off building 43.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   I want to talk about actually something a little more serious, which is the controversy over
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   Google and 9-1-1 in just a second.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   Yes, it's time for a commercial.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   This show now has commercials.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   Yay.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.840]   Yay, two of them.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   First of all, we want to welcome Squarespace.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.840]   We thank them for supporting the show and Audible.com.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840]   They've been on before.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   They're back on a regular basis.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   And they said, "You'll like this, Jeff.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   You can recommend any book you want.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   Just don't recommend Jeff's book."
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   Hey!
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.840]   I don't think you should take it personally.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   I think they just figure everybody knows about what would Google do.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840]   And I've got to plug it, darn it.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   You can plug it all you want.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   I just -- and we'll mention it.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   We'll say that it's in there.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   But it's just -- I can't be our book pick of the week, I guess.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   But I do actually want to talk about Squarespace first.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   Either of you ever use Squarespace or know about Squarespace?
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   Very cool.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   You're hearing about it, I haven't used it yet.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   They've been a sponsor on a number of our shows for some time.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:24.440]   We actually -- we tried them out by moving all of our blogs over to Squarespace.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.320]   If you want to take a look at Inside.Twit.tv, that's our in-house blog, what a great move
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.840]   this was.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.080]   It is not just blogging software, though.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.800]   It's hosting and it's software that makes it possible to do a variety of really remarkable
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.920]   things.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   You can host a blog, of course, but you can also -- it's got photo galleries, forums,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.080]   amazing stat pages.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.200]   The templates are gorgeous.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   Anytime you're thinking about setting up a page -- and I think this is kind of the trend
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.520]   these days -- you might want to -- I host my own stuff and I'm starting to think, what
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.680]   a mistake this has been.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.760]   You'll let the pros do the hosting.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:16.560]   Squarespace.com, very affordable, but you can try it absolutely free if you go to squarespace.com/twig
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.800]   -- squarespace.com/twig.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.680]   You can give it a try and take a look at all they have to offer.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.760]   Very easy to try it, too, because they have seamless blog importing from moveable type,
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.040]   WordPress type pad and blogger.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.320]   Incredible templates that will get you up and running very quickly, but then customization
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.840]   couldn't be simpler.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.200]   In fact, it's using Ajax, so it's drag and drop so you can very quickly change how you
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.640]   do it.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.320]   Squarespace is just really a remarkable solution.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.280]   They've always been able to import WordPress, blogger, type pad, and moveable type, but
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.160]   they've even improved their blogging tool.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:06.640]   They just announced -- I just saw this on TechCrunch, a new blogging tool that will
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.640]   get almost -- everybody, just enter the credentials and it all gets sucked in.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.880]   They have submitted an iPhone application, which will make it very easy to post.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.520]   That should be up there very soon.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.520]   This is just an incredible solution for you.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.280]   If you're looking to set up your first website or if you've got a website and you want to
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.600]   move it somewhere where it will always be up, always be running, this is the way to do it.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.800]   squarespace.com/twig.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.760]   Try it absolutely free.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.960]   The trial version will win you over, though.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.000]   I'm going to warn you.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   squarespace.com/twig.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.480]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.440]   9/11 was yesterday.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:57.600]   Google with these doodles has been pretty clear that they're going to say things about lightweight
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.560]   things, not necessarily about national holidays, religious holidays.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.720]   In this case, they didn't do anything about 9/11.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.640]   A lot of people were offended by that.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.640]   Adam, do you think that that's something --
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   >> New ones.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   >> -- Fox News.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   Maybe not a lot of people.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.240]   But I see some stuff in the blogosphere.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.800]   Do you think Google should be doing some sort of commemoration of 9/11 or is that just
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.760]   too narrow?
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:29.360]   >> You know, I personally don't feel -- Google has set up this expectation that for everything
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:36.520]   that comes around, there's going to be some sort of a custom Google homepage image.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.640]   But Google has also become such a giant corporation that they're so careful, I think, or a lot
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.360]   more careful now than they used to be.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   I feel like have they done it?
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   They've done it in the past.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   >> That's a good question.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   Have they done it in the past?
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360]   I don't know.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   >> No, I don't know.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   >> Have they not?
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   >> They never have.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   >> I don't think they have.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.880]   But when they use that space for serendipitous things like Halloween and aliens of the company
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:06.840]   knows, then to me to a 3/9/11 would have been, I think, even in poor taste.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.680]   And it's a kind of reverse political correctness test that anybody can be offended by anything
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   in this country anymore.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.760]   And so they just yell that Google should be doing what I think they should do.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.600]   When most days of the year, they don't do crap with that.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.200]   At the same time, however, they bragged on their official blog that they were the heart
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.400]   of and trying to look it up here right now.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:36.880]   A 9/11 history feature put out by, I think, the official library of the 9/11 library memorial
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.160]   that allows people to put up their stories against Google Maps.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.560]   And it's really quite good.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   >> That's more serious.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.120]   And certainly that's a more valuable application.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120]   >> And far more value.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.760]   The more they're going to do, change the L into one of two towers.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   >> Right.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   The doodle is so lightweight.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   And yet I look what Microsoft did with Bing, and I think it's actually quite beautiful and
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   appropriate.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.000]   >> It's a different thing.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.240]   >> But they have that whole picture on Bing.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   They showed the memorial, which is the lights where the tower was shining up into the sky.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.720]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.600]   And then they have, well, it's now, maybe this does trivialize it because then below
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.080]   they have some New York-related searches, but it's check the weather in New York and
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.720]   find events in New York.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.920]   So it does in some way trivialize it.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.520]   >> Oh, algorithms that get you every time.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.920]   >> Yeah, they will.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.000]   >> I just found the references to something called Make History at the National September
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.120]   11th Memorial and Museum.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.720]   And it uses the Google Maps API, and you just wander around there.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.840]   And I was there that day at the World Trade Center.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.920]   And was a block wave in the South Tower when it came down.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.920]   So I have visions seared in my brain.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.760]   And I found a whole new video there I'd never seen before that just brought back the real
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.080]   feeling of being there that day after the towers came down.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.680]   And so that's a far more powerful statement.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.360]   I think that Microsoft is in a more difficult position because they couldn't put a cute cat
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.360]   picture on that day.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   Google is just Google every day.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.840]   >> Well, and also, both these companies are international companies.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.360]   And so I see that they might not want to do something that's so specifically American.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.480]   And yet 911, I think everybody worldwide is very aware of it.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:29.000]   >> Well, Adam, Leo, do you know when they change the American logo, does that change
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   internationally?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.760]   Do they do specific things for Germany or France?
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.960]   Do they do cheese logos on French cheese day or whatever?
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   >> I don't know.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.360]   >> I would imagine they do have localization, don't you?
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.360]   >> Being or Google?
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.080]   >> Well, both, actually.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.240]   >> Neither, but Google's doodles are worldwide.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.440]   >> Well, but we have a Thanksgiving, they always do a Thanksgiving logo.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.400]   And is that a little more?
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.360]   >> That's very US effect.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.440]   >> Well, no, I mean, do they do it?
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   Does it show worldwide?
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440]   >> That's a good question.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   I guess not.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.560]   >> In the chat, we have web 131 saying no is international.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.000]   And then we have Dom R saying no, Google doesn't do that.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.760]   Google's different in each country, says it's a little one.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.400]   So we have no ribbon chat, that's new.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.840]   Dom R who lives in the UK says we see the US logos in the UK.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.600]   On the other hand, Steve H who lives in Canada says, Canada has Thanksgiving Day, but it's
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   a month earlier.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.800]   And he says we see the Thanksgiving logo in October in Canada.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.480]   And of course, we see it in November in the US.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.720]   So I don't know.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.240]   But it's something new that nobody ever had to think about before.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.480]   It's true for us too as shows on the internet, we're global.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.720]   And for a long time, I was doing audible recommendations where US only and stuff.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.280]   And don't worry, your audience will make you aware of that.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.720]   >> Yeah, we always get all kinds of complaints when we post about something on life hacker
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.560]   and it turns out to be US only.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.480]   >> But it's always tough to know.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.000]   You have to like to make that check, I don't know, like proxying from another country to
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.600]   test everything because a lot of things just don't tell you.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.560]   >> I, but I think that's a lesson that we're learning that I'm glad to learn.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.720]   I mean, I think that's a great lesson and I love it that we're international.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.520]   And I know that Google's very aware of this and come to think of it.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.680]   If you saw, it may be these people are looking at Google.com and if they go to Google.ca
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:26.400]   or Google.co.il as one of our Israeli listeners says, they're going to see localized stuff
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.720]   at that site, I'm sure, because they certainly get localized languages.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.600]   So I'm sure they would get localized stuff.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   >> So a tapest in a teapot, the 911, I agree.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.840]   A doodle isn't really the right way to do it.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.680]   >> And I'm not a necessarily a religious Fox News Basher, but it was a fairly obvious
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   stand for them.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.320]   >> Oh yeah, they're going to say something about it.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.280]   >> Yeah, to say this is a patriotic test and you failed.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.720]   >> You know, what can you do?
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.560]   >> It's the, everybody wants to shoot at Google least.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.560]   >> Yes.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.560]   >> Now they're the biggest target around.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.600]   >> They're the most creative journalism in the US right now.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   Let's see.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:15.360]   I'm seeing these articles bring back the small Google search box just cracks me up.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.600]   >> Not just bring it back, but create a script for it.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   That's going to do that.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   Adam couldn't do it.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   I couldn't do it.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.600]   >> I do love it.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.920]   >> Article in the Washington Post, Google economist sees good signs in searches.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.800]   I didn't even know Google had a chief economist, but it does how varying.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.360]   >> He's brilliant.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   You know him?
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.600]   >> Well, I haven't met him, but he's pretty amazing and really is I think critical to
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.800]   Google's strategic success because he does see these big trends.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.520]   And he said in this article that he sees financial recovery because they already know
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.440]   that Google is a good predictor of the job numbers.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.880]   My people looking for jobs, they're seeing an uptick in housing.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.080]   So I went into Google Trends myself and I started looking upwards like unemployment
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.080]   and housing.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:06.920]   A little bit off, but what interested me was the bottom half of Google Trends is news
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.160]   media references.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.520]   And every single one I looked at was coming up.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.800]   It looks like they haven't, I guess it looks like down there.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.160]   They haven't, I wonder whether they've added more sources and they haven't regularized
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.160]   that or something.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:28.320]   But anyway, if you look at things like jobs in Google and stock in trends, it's quite
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   amazing to see.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.600]   If you look at the long term trends since 2004, you really get a different picture.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.120]   >> This is the amazing thing about Search.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.200]   And it's one of the things that people talk a lot about with Twitter, friend feed and
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:46.080]   others is the metadata or the additional data that you can extrapolate by collecting a lot
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.760]   of content and looking at it.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.880]   Is Twitter better situated to do that than Google?
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.320]   It seems like Google's got everything, including all the Twitter data.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.600]   >> Well, I think the thing about Twitter that always, I guess, pits them against Google
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.880]   and makes Google probably a little nervous is how whatever.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.840]   It's what everyone always talks about, the real time search.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.720]   But yesterday afternoon, I don't know if you guys read about it, but the space shuttle
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.920]   was going to land in Florida and there was weather or something.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.800]   And they ended up landing at Edwards Air Force Space in California.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.000]   And the space shuttle, I think, re-entered the atmosphere above Los Angeles somewhere.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.840]   And two loud sonic booms that scared the crap out of everyone.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   >> Because it was unexpected.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840]   >> And no one knew it was happening.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:41.560]   And the first place that I looked to see what was going on is Twitter because I know it's
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.280]   going to be the first place that it's going to be, I can search that and it'll be published
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.640]   and it'll be indexed and I can find it.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.040]   >> I think Google's certainly aware of that.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.800]   But I think Google News into the universal search was the first attempt to do that.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.440]   But they're not good at live.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   They're just simply not.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.440]   And you're right, Adam.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.360]   It's about Twitter has what's happening from the witnesses.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.000]   This morning I saw that a whole bunch of San Franciscans were cowering under their beds
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.160]   saying that they were hearing lightning and thunder, and they're hearing thunder.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160]   >> We're not used to it.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   >> We're not used to it.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.160]   >> Exactly.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   >> I accused them of having sissy weather.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.360]   >> It was really funny to see that.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.880]   Because we had it up here in Northern.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.520]   But I grew up in Baggy, so lightning, big deal.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.720]   But these guys, they don't know.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   My kids heard the booming.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.320]   They had no idea what was going on.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.040]   >> What was bombs and all kinds of things?
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   >> It was really loud.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.800]   I have to say, so it's very wistful.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   >> It usually is.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.400]   >> Maybe I'm getting to be a wussy Northern California.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.240]   But that's two different kinds of search.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.880]   There's real time search, which is searching on stuff that happened right now.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.120]   You wouldn't use Twitter to judge the economic vitality of the US.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.840]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.840]   That's interesting.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.360]   That's a really interesting thing.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.200]   Jonathan Harris, who's a really brilliant artist, is looking at mood things on Twitter.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.080]   He was the original designer for Daylight for my partner.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.520]   And I'm forgetting the name of his service, unfortunately.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:15.680]   But I wonder if you tracked mood words on Twitter over a longer period of time if you
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.920]   could put that against stock prices and jobless.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   >> That's interesting.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:28.200]   And actually, I think there's already some Twitter applications that are tracking things
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   in that direction.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.640]   There's one that I looked at once where you can, you give them your username and it analyzes
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.040]   your tweets and says, "What kind of-- how many percent of them are negative tweets or
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.520]   positive or what's your tweeting attitude?"
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.880]   >> I don't want to know either.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   My attitude sucks.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   But that's--
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.560]   >> Leo, you're the nicest guy on the internet.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   >> Oh, you haven't seen my new stickers.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   We just ordered these.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.920]   Leo, report.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.800]   Remember kids, Uncle Leo, it's got a picture of me.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   Remember kids, Uncle Leo says, "Screw you!"
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.960]   We're going to make a million dollars in these.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   They're going to sell like crazy.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.480]   >> I'll buy a chance.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.640]   >> So, can Google do real time?
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   Is it impossible?
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.760]   >> Well, as they're presently constructed, yeah, but I think that as I mentioned last
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   week, I heard Marissa and I are talking about hyper personal news streams and if she's
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.680]   talking about it, they're thinking about it.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.160]   >> Well, they're thinking about it.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.600]   Of course, they have to look and say, "Look at all this value that's being created by
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   real time search."
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.400]   The question is, do they have the data?
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.400]   >> Adam, what is it?
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.600]   >> Well, Google has-- I mean, I feel like I've heard at least maybe it's a speculation that
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:45.360]   Google has talked to Twitter and trying to get their real time feed basically so they
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   can index it instantly.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   >> Right.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   >> The fire hose, we call it.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.040]   >> Right, but at the same time, obviously they have the potential for that.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.120]   Maybe even in something like Google Wave at some point because there can be waves that
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:05.160]   are public and if people were to start using Wave on mass and it was a popular thing and
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.280]   you could have the option to make certain types of discussions like public part of the
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:17.240]   searchable Google database, I mean, it could be another source of that sort of information.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.320]   >> It's very intriguing.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:28.280]   Is real time search a fad or a long term viable solution and is it just something that goes
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.520]   in parallel with a traditional Google style search or does it replace Google style search?
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   Adam?
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.600]   >> I don't think it replaces Google style search.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   I think that it's a specific sort of need for specific types of searches but at the same
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:52.040]   time, if you're-- when I search Twitter to-- I search Los Angeles boom or something because
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.880]   I want to know what happened that felt like something hit my house but weirdly in a not
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.680]   normal way, I have to weed through a lot of--
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   >> There's a lot of crap.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:08.760]   >> It doesn't give me the story and I have to sort of still judge-- I have to use some
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.720]   discrimination about what is real and what's not because some people were saying Los Angeles,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.960]   oh my god, there was an earthquake.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   And if Google-- I mean, ideally with real time search, the engine would be making those
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:29.400]   decisions for me and sort of aggregating the results and creating like the most likely
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.520]   answer or things like that that are actually useful to me because as is, it's great that
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.360]   you can do that with Twitter but it's not perfect.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.120]   >> I think you're right, we've got to find ways to add value on top of Twitter and that's
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.280]   where there's going to be a lot of success.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.960]   There's tinker.com which comes from glam.com, the largest women's network online and it's
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:56.000]   really pretty impressive about how they're trying to find curated streams from Twitter.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.600]   I didn't experiment last week, I went to Twitter and I searched because I'm having surgery
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.840]   on Monday, I searched the word prostate and I got nothing but spam.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.560]   >> Oh interesting.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:11.520]   >> But by the way, one of which is a little aside here, one in alternative therapies like
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.880]   take my vitamin therapy, don't have your surgery.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.720]   One of them was from men who of a certain age will understand why this is weird, suggested
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   massage therapy.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.240]   If you know how you get to the prostate, that's rather--
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.760]   >> What part are they going to massage?
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.520]   >> Oh, you don't want to know, you don't want to know.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.040]   But that's Adam's word, right.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.680]   I got that junk by pure Twitter search.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.760]   It's a clay-shirky rule.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.760]   Too much stuff, it's not too much stuff, it's a case of filter failure.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   And you need to add value.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.640]   But the other way I look at it these days where I talk to media folks is that they're
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.480]   getting their audience, some of their audience probably the smallest bit from people who are
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.120]   loyal to them and go to them directly, they're getting a hell of a lot from search, they're
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:57.040]   getting a lot now from aggregation, and they're also getting a lot from human links.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.680]   We talked, I think in the first show, about bitly causing as many links a month, clicks
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.480]   a month as Google News, a billion a month.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.880]   And so you have to all add all that up together, I think, to a new ecosystem.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.840]   And when you add in things like insinuating yourself in streams with RSS and other means
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.120]   and widgets and APIs, I think the API, you're penor charting on my partner, Daylife, has
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.640]   said that that's really the next frontier of distribution.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.000]   And so you add it all in together and it becomes a new whole.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.560]   So it's a synergized all of the above.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.720]   With some judgment involved because you're right, I'm just searching Twitter for prostate
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.520]   and it's universally worthless.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.920]   There's nothing good in here.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.240]   So where you see a problem, there's always an opportunity.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   So Adam is right.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.960]   I mean, he's thinking like the developer that he is in terms of saying, well, how do I
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   fix that?
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   What's the problem?
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   How do we fix it?
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.440]   And those who fix it will have businesses, I think.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.160]   Did you see what Facebook did with Facebook Lite?
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.520]   Talk about going after Twitter and now they've added @sign stuff.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   I mean, they're looking, they look almost like Twitter.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.880]   And I have to say with the failures that Twitter's had, the inability it has had to keep up with
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.720]   the volume, the spamming, it really seems like their platform is unable to handle a lot
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.880]   of the problems that they're facing.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.080]   It seems like there's an opening for somebody like Facebook if they can execute to come along
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.200]   and steal that.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.000]   Now Facebook has a lot more metadata than Twitter does that can and can doesn't have
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   the spam issue, right?
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.040]   Because it's hard to spam Facebook, I think.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.440]   I think it's easier now than it once was.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440]   Never say never.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.240]   Used to be difficult to get a Facebook account if you want a student, you know?
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   Right.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.160]   But, and then I think it went to corporations or something and then it opened up much more
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.480]   wide.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:01.800]   But yeah, you know, my problem with Twitter, and I had this conversation with Gene a lot
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.400]   of times, and Facebook both is that when you've got, they become these platforms in themselves,
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.920]   but they're not a platform.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.040]   You know, it's a company who owns all this data.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   It's not.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   Right.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:20.640]   So, you know, people always talk about Twitter, RSS is dead, email is dead, Twitter is everything.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.240]   But it's always so disheartening when you think about it in the terms where it's like,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.560]   Well, because it's dysfunctional.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   It's not merely.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.240]   Well, and it's, and it did, but someone owns it.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   Like no one owns a closed left.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.680]   Like SMTP or, or like RSS, the protocols.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.400]   And anyone can implement them and anyone can use that.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.600]   And if Ev says Google, you can't have the fire hose, Google's out of luck.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:51.400]   And I think that's one of the cool things again, given the Google way to do because it's
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:56.240]   installable anywhere, presumably with enough time and enough people being able to learn
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.760]   the technology and everything.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.320]   It's open source and it can be, and it can be installed on anyone's servers.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.800]   So potentially it could do the same sorts of real time stuff that, that Twitter does,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.640]   it wouldn't belong necessarily to Google.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   That's really interesting.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.920]   And as, as you know, we'll tell you that we talk about Google Wave.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   I think every show we should have called it the Google Wave Show.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.800]   Well, until wave comes, until wave comes out and then we find out.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   I think we found out stuff I guess.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.560]   But, but I think you're right there.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:30.280]   And you add in these various elements that make up a more rich whole, more valuable whole.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.400]   You have the identity that Facebook has, which I think is incredibly valuable to this.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.920]   Forget that.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.120]   I'm sorry that that happened.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   Keep continuing on.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.880]   It really scares me to hear me.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.920]   I clicked, I clicked a link and all of a sudden I'm hearing you twice.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.200]   But that is, this is a fright.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   It's even really.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   But you have a greater whole.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:02.080]   So the identity of Facebook matters and the functionality of Wave enabling you to add
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.800]   in new relationships of people and the content and publishing new ways.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.200]   I think it becomes something bigger than what we have now.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.520]   And I'm not like, I'm not a total wave.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.280]   I'm not won over by wave at this point.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.960]   I think last week you guys were talking about you and Leo haven't tried it.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960]   Neither of you have tried it, right?
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   No.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   At this point.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   No, I'm still having it.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   I haven't got the invite.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.840]   Somebody at Google sent me an email saying you, you're on the media list, but you'll get
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.240]   it at the end of this month.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   And I think you are.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.640]   I think, no, no, I think you're on the media list too.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.880]   I would be willing to guess as the author of a fine book called What Would Google Do?
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:46.120]   But I think that at this point, what you guys talked about last week was right where
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:51.240]   it's like as long as Wave, when Wave is still limited to a small group of people, it's actually
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.280]   just like, it's confusing.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.800]   And you don't know what the point would be.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:02.320]   I'm hoping, honestly, it's not no one who I know has tried it as a user.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.520]   Like from that perspective, a developer perspective is maybe something entirely different.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.920]   But from a user perspective, anyone I know who's tried it has been a little bit confused
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.600]   or disappointed with what they've seen.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.400]   But I don't think that's like Google Wave will never work.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.240]   I just think at this point, it's not really a user platform.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   Right.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.780]   Well, and I've said this before too, as soon as we can run a Wave server, I plan
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.780]   to.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.780]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:33.440]   And I can imagine using Wave for this show, for instance, to incorporate listeners'
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.360]   comments in and one hopes more.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.280]   So maybe that'll happen as soon as September.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.960]   They're going to add 100,000 users in September.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:49.000]   That might be when it really, well, we can all see what Wave will do.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.240]   I remain excited, but hesitant.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.820]   Hey, I do want to mention somebody from, I think it was from Google sent me an email
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:02.020]   saying, you really ought to take calls and comments and suggestions on the show.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.460]   And I'd like to say that we're going to start doing this.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.100]   I was able to get a Google voice invite from, I said, yeah, I'd be glad to do it if I could
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.980]   only get another Google voice account.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.460]   So he sent me an invite.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.540]   So we now have a call Twig number.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.340]   It's 97.95 Twig VM.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.860]   It's a Google voice mailbox.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.520]   So call, leave a message if you have a comment or a suggestion.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.240]   If you'd like to say, Leo, you're crazy or Jeff really understands what he's talking
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.760]   about or perhaps make a recommendation for a prostate massage.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.800]   97.95 Twig VM, TWIG VM.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.040]   That's 979-589-4486.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   Toll charges will apply.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.920]   None of the Google voice numbers are toll free.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.480]   I don't even know where 979 is.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.700]   I think it's North Carolina.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   979-589-4486.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:54.020]   If you can keep it to under a minute, remember that when you leave a message, you're giving
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.340]   us permission to use it on the show.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.380]   And I hope starting next week we'll be getting some callers voicemail messages on the show
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.260]   through Google or text.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.620]   If you text it, it'll also come in through a Google voice.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.140]   So that is a way to respond back.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.500]   Not exactly real time as Google Wave will be.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:17.040]   So do you think that given what you just said, Adam, about Twitter being proprietary, it's
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.600]   really hopeless or futile or stupid to say, "Well, Facebook might be doing it first."
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.360]   I mean, that's just another proprietary platform, right?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.280]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.600]   This is my opinion as someone who doesn't like the idea of having all of his information
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:38.040]   locked in to someone who can change their terms of service at any time and leave you
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.640]   kind of stuck.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.960]   I'm just not like, I'm not big on the idea of either of the- I think they're both great
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   services.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:51.200]   Don't get me wrong, I like Twitter and I actually have grown to like Facebook over time.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:38:00.960]   But I get uncomfortable about the idea that everything belongs to them and everyone is-
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   everyone's supporting.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:07.600]   There's Twitter links and Twitter movies, movie trailers have Twitter handles on it.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.480]   Everyone is moving.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:17.040]   It's the new like, it used to be at the end of the trailer, it was novel when they started
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.080]   adding websites that would be like, what is thematrix.com or whatever.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.800]   It was like, "Whoa, look at these guys, the future, movies and the internet."
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.560]   And now it's all at, what is the matrix?
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.400]   It is amazing, isn't it?
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.280]   But that's trendy and maybe that'll catch on.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:41.160]   Or maybe it's just this week's flavor of the month.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.560]   So yeah, I like Facebook only because it's lighter.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:51.120]   But I am with you 100% Adam that I feel like, I think this became real to me when Friendfeet
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   was sold to Facebook.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.000]   But I've always worried a little bit about how much value that we're pouring into companies
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.880]   like Twitter and why should we be?
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.040]   But there hasn't been an open choice.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.520]   And I think that they're all aware of this and I think that's why they struggle so hard
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.600]   to try and appear open.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.960]   Twitter has a great API and that's great and everyone uses it.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:21.600]   In our links this week, Friendfeet/Facebook now open sourced the...
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.600]   Tornado.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.200]   Yeah, Tornado.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.440]   The real time messaging and whatnot that Friendfeet technology of Friendfeet is built
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   on.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:35.720]   So I think they're all aware of it and trying their best to appear as open as possible.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.040]   But ultimately, they're never going to be totally open.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.920]   Well, it's an interesting question whether Friendfeet did that or Facebook did that.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   Right.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:49.120]   But Adam, I think you're right that if we need to compare back to earlier players, Twitter
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.560]   is one hell of a lot more open than Facebook ever was or still is.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.120]   And we complain about that too, but I think that's quite important.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.360]   Or as I remember back to the earliest days of Blogger, if I'm right, it took a while
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.200]   before you had a means to export your stuff to other platforms.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.160]   Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.400]   It's an important issue.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.600]   Google now has its...
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.680]   I forget what they call it.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.840]   They're initiative to make sure that they just do more things this week to make sure
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:24.280]   that your stuff is portable and that's an important philosophical piece there.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:30.160]   So, I tend to want to give Twitter some time and they hell they're developing something
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   that's wholly new to us and people just beat them up when they're down.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.320]   It's free and they do keep adding things.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.600]   So I want to be a little forgiving.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:47.800]   They did the right thing this week by putting out a new terms of service that opened it
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:53.040]   up, said that you own your own tweets, but also said, and we might be adding advertising.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:59.160]   But I thought it was actually in stark contrast to Facebook's stumble on their terms of service.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.160]   Twitter was very clear.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.160]   You own your own tweets.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   We don't own them.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.160]   So you're right.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.960]   One, you know, one thing about that, though, if they had learned from Facebook, they would
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:12.600]   have put out a beta version of the TOS where they want us to have some comment first.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   Right.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.200]   And had people be upset and then they could fix disaster.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.880]   No, actually, but they...
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.240]   Pardon me, perhaps that's what Google would do.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.880]   No, in fact, you're exactly right.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.200]   If they had put out what they put out and asked people for comment, even that would have been
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   funny.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.400]   They don't have to play around with a draconian choice that we then get them to back off.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400]   No, I think you're right.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.600]   I think that that...
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.400]   This lesson's still not quite learned.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   Not quite learned.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.360]   Hey, again, a reminder, our listener feedback line is now online.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.760]   A reminder feedback via Google Voice at 9795 Twig VM.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.600]   I love it that Google Voice lets you spell out stuff, but you can never really spell
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.040]   out anything you want.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.560]   So that's the closest I could get.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   97...
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   That's my...
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   I love Leo or something like that.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   I tried everything.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:09.520]   I actually have 2525 Hey Leo.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.000]   But I'm going to keep that for myself.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:23.040]   9795 Twig VM that's outside the US plus 1 979 589 4486, which is not a bad number, which
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.240]   you can call and leave a message there and we will use your messages on the show next
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.600]   week if we get any.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.080]   Meanwhile, I want to talk to you about Audible.com.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.160]   We're going to take a little break at them if you want to run out and go to the bathroom
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   or anything.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.120]   This is the time when the rest of the hosts just start to ignore me.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.360]   And you can do so as well.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.800]   We'll be back in a minute.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.520]   You get your free book right now by joining Audible.com, joining them and getting that
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.000]   great gold account.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.440]   That's one book a month and your first book is absolutely free.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.080]   So we've got a URL just for the show, brand new one, AudiblePodcast.com.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.600]   I'm typing it in just to make sure it works.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:14.760]   #Twig AudiblePodcast.com/Twig and Audible is a wonderful resource for those of you who
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.960]   aren't familiar with it for audio entertainment.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.000]   I know if you're listening to podcasts, you probably already know a little bit about listening
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.040]   to spoken word stuff.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.880]   Audible just is going to expand your repertoire considerably.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.160]   Whether it's serious books like Betty Friedan's, The Feminine Mystique, out for the first time
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   in audio.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.000]   Thanks to Audible for recording that.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.720]   To the latest Pot Boiler from Dan Brown, The Lost Symbol, yes, they've got that.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:48.120]   Audible has 60,000 titles on all sorts of topics, including business, including Jeff's
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.640]   book, What Would Google Do, which I'm not supposed to plug, but I'm going to anyway.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.600]   No, they didn't say don't plug it.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.880]   They just say have another pick in addition to what would Google do.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   Audible?
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.640]   I'm listening to Chris Anderson's free right now on Audible.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   Is it on Audible?
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   I think so.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   Awesome.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.280]   I'm going to order it right now.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.960]   The future of a radical price.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   This is a...
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.200]   You also put it out for free, but I paid for it.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   Worth paying for.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.440]   Hey, look at this.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.480]   It looks like Audible selling it for free.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.280]   The price on free is $0 on Audible.com.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.280]   Run on over there.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.280]   That's really cool.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.240]   Good for you Audible.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   They have an abridged version.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.760]   I wonder if the abridged version costs more.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   Fewer words.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.320]   Yeah, 1889.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.680]   So get the unabridged...
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.840]   You pay for the fewer words.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.240]   Get the unabridged version.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   That can't be right.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.080]   Let me add that to my cart and see.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   Is that an error?
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.360]   Yeah, no, I think that Chris Anderson did that with them.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.000]   Isn't that wonderful?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.520]   And they put it up free on Kindle too, I think, but then he still went out and the best seller
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.320]   listed damn him.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.280]   Well, that proves his point.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.600]   You can give stuff away and still make a good living.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   There's a good one.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   Get that one for free.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.280]   The future of a radical price.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.880]   Tell me, do you like it?
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.280]   Do you agree with him or do you disagree?
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   You think it's...
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.920]   Yeah, no, I do agree with him and kind of preemptively quoted in my book.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.200]   Nothing I want to plug that again.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.120]   No, I think that he's...
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.920]   The problem in this new world is that people just think that we're slightly adapting the
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.080]   old models and old structures that we're not.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.960]   And what Chris sees in both his books and I tried to make sure he does is try to explain
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.680]   that no, folks, it's bigger than you think.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.680]   And Chris is very good at doing that.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.080]   He really is the author of the long tail, of course.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   And this is his latest and much recommended free, the future of a radical price at an amazing
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.880]   price thanks to Audible and Chris free.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:48.040]   So I don't know if I should even make, you don't get that and get another book free.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.480]   Get that and what would Google do?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.400]   Now you're doing wonders for Audible's bottom line.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.160]   Now you're doing good.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:59.320]   Audiblepodcast.com/twig.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.160]   Thank them so much for their support.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.400]   If you like the shows that we do on this week in tech, you can thank Audible for making
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.920]   it impossible.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.960]   When he talks about free is a podcast, an example of free, I mean, is advertising supported
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.160]   media an example of free?
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.160]   Sure.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.400]   That's only where the model and media was invented was TV and radio.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   Right.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   So that's...
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   So even...
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   Those who scream today about, you know, that people should pay.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.280]   Well, no, there's an economy out here that just doesn't have that.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:35.360]   Well, and I think it's part of the problem for the record companies and others is that
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.800]   if people are used to getting stuff for free, free music on the radio, they're already pre-conditioned
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.480]   to free content.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.240]   So it's going to get very hard to make them pay for content if they're not...
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.720]   If they haven't paid for it in the past.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.480]   Or Chris's point, or the economic exchange.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.440]   They pay a lot more now for concert tickets than they used to.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.280]   Oh, very good point.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:01.080]   You know, Fred Wilson's line about freemium in music becomes almost a freemium model.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.680]   You people are, yeah, some number are getting the music for free.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.280]   Not all, but some.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:11.320]   But it pumps the record sales, the record sales pump the concerts now.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   That's what...
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:18.800]   Well, part of the news we have this week is the Google added into the newspaper Association
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   of America, taking...
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.940]   Google checkout and offering it up to those who want to pay wall as a means to bring micro
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.000]   payments to newspapers.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Which I don't like because I don't think it's going to work.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.520]   I think it's actually going to kill papers faster.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:41.240]   I've tweeted that I thought it was a cynical act that Google was using its unused checkout
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:47.320]   to try to curry favor with newspapers in their useless quest for a new revenue stream.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.840]   And somebody else said in Twitter that, "No, it was also a masterful stroke."
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:58.520]   And I said, "No, cynicism and masterful strokes are not at all mutually exclusive."
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.000]   So I think Google payment is a great system, by the way.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.240]   I use it whenever I can.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.040]   The problem is I can rarely use it because most people, most vendors...
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.040]   I've never used it.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.960]   Adam, have you ever used it?
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   Never.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.960]   Adam?
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   Oh.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.960]   Adam?
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.960]   I'm sorry, can you hear me?
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   Hello?
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   I potted him down.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   There you go.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.960]   I have not.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.280]   I'm the only one who he hears used it.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:24.440]   I can remember where I've used it, but I've used it a number of times.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.400]   I would love to use it instead of PayPal.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.080]   I wish more people would take it.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:33.320]   Oh, I have used it one time, I guess.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.120]   Like charity donation site.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.400]   Twistable or something, yeah.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.680]   Is Microsoft's payment structure still out there?
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.600]   I didn't know they had one.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.520]   Oh, yeah, when they bought you Pender Chardonnaugh's prior company...
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.920]   Oh, this is horrible on me.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.000]   Oh, I should know this.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.040]   It was the only one for so long, and I always argued that the reason it didn't work is because
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.920]   no one's going to trust Microsoft for their money.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.080]   But no, we trust PayPal?
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.320]   I mean, I don't know about that.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.680]   I'm looking for Microsoft MicroPIM.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.040]   Wave points, is that it?
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.040]   No, that's Windows 1.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.400]   By the way, that's a terrible system.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.960]   I do use that.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.560]   Let me see here.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:30.880]   Microsoft is working on a micro-payment system for the web.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.800]   This was something Bill Gates was always pushing.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.680]   Remember, I remember in his convex speeches where you'd wave a wallet at the Starbucks
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.800]   cart and you'd get paid.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.600]   What is Google proposing with the online news payment system?
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.800]   How would that work?
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:49.200]   They're proposing micro-payments, which Clay Shurkey is who will get on this podcast one
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.720]   day or another is eloquent about that.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.520]   That's nickel and dining people and nobody wants to be nickel and dining.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.000]   It's not going to work.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.360]   It's just simply not going to work.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.600]   The cost of doing it is very high.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.680]   That's why I think it's a cynical act.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.480]   I think Google knows that, even though Sergey has talked about, "Well, we should help them
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.640]   do this for newspapers."
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.680]   The economics just don't make sense.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   I don't think.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:15.600]   I'm not convinced that I'll wait till Clay's on before we really debate this.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.840]   Boy, if I could charge a buck every time you downloaded a show, what would be wrong with
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840]   that?
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.240]   What would Audible say about that?
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.080]   I mean, where are you going to make more money in the long run?
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.040]   I think it was really a question.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.360]   It is a question and it's an unanswered question.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:37.040]   If I could get the same number of people paying a buck a show, I'd make a lot more money.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.720]   I think you might make more money by just getting donations.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.720]   We've done that.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.720]   No, isn't that interesting?
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:48.000]   The first thing, my first goal five years ago when I started doing all of this was I
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.800]   said, "I will never take ads."
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.280]   I never say never.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.280]   Learn my lesson.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:51:01.760]   I said, "I will never take ads because I really love the idea of the direct drive between
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.080]   your listeners and the content.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.800]   Just pay for the content.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.880]   If they like it, they pay for it if they don't.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.680]   But the problem was only about 1% of everybody who listened, maybe even less, paid.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680]   So it wasn't enough to do it.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.640]   It was still an Frentr and other places like that.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.920]   I don't think NCR gets to 4%, but they do it by needling you every five minutes.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.960]   I wasn't willing to do that.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:28.760]   Adam, do you pay for content anywhere?
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.360]   I would say virtually no.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.360]   Not at all.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.360]   You know what I just did?
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:37.880]   I did it more out of altruism than anything else.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:44.200]   R's Technica has decided to do a premium version for 50 bucks a year, which it's CondiNast,
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   guaranteed flop.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   It's guaranteed.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   They have some stuff.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.720]   You get chats with the editors.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.480]   You get a special forum.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:56.880]   The only thing that I thought was in the least bit of value to me was you get the full RSS
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.200]   feeds and you don't get ads on the site.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:05.320]   I thought, well, getting the full RSS feeds in my Google Reader, now that would be nice.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.480]   Really the truth is it was an act of charity to send them 50 bucks.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.480]   How many people are going to pay for this?
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.960]   Nobody's going to do it.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.000]   The effort is just not worth it.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.320]   It seems to me.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:22.160]   I think that we quickly learned that people considered the shows of great value.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.160]   They love the show.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.520]   We have huge audience numbers, but nobody's going to send me.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.040]   I've asked two bucks a month.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.880]   He's going to send very, very few people who will do that.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.280]   One in 100 will do it.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.200]   I thank those one in 100, but we had to take advertising or we couldn't grow.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.200]   I got it.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   Microsoft Passport.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.200]   Passport.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   Oh, I knew about Passport.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   Did that happen?
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   I didn't know that in a micro payment associate.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.800]   I thought it was a single sign on.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   Right.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   Right.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   But I think it was a structure.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.280]   It was actually, Microsoft bought Firefly, the original collaborative filtering company,
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   which you've been disheartened on, started at MIT Media Lab with others.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.760]   They really, all they wanted out of it was this payment structure.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.640]   I should have known the answer because I am one of the last Passport users in the world.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   I still log on to Windows Live with my Passport account and Expedia.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   I know.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.880]   I hold on.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.920]   So you think it's cynical of Google?
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.320]   I'm not sure I would jump on that.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.320]   I think it might be that Google really wants to give micro payments a chance.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.980]   We've never really given that a chance.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:24.800]   We don't know it would fail.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.680]   If I could set up a system to charge a buck just to see what would happen, I would use
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:34.320]   it to make a buck bet with you right now that it won't work.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.440]   You're with Chris Anderson on the free side.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.440]   Nothing I'm against charging.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.640]   I just don't think it's where the economics are.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:47.240]   And I think it's too soon to shut media down behind paywalt.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.080]   There are, I mean, obviously, as Rupert Murdoch has pointed out, their Wall Street Journal
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.280]   makes money behind a paywall.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.640]   But it's one of very few things that make money behind a paywall.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.960]   Well, this weekend, the Times of London is going behind the wall.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.960]   Right.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.960]   So we'll see how that works.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.000]   This will be the test maybe.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.080]   This is that the test we've waited for.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.400]   And you'll have to buy a year's subscription.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.880]   What if, you know, I would love to see somebody do that and say, pay 25 cents an article.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   I think it'll be that too.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.480]   And the rumors are the New York Times is looking at membership or at metering.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.120]   Oh, you've read too much.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:26.600]   Gotta pay now, which seems silly to me because it's because you're most you're punishing
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.280]   your most loyal readers.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   Right.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.280]   Right.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   I love you.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   Oh, well, you better pay us then.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.520]   If you love us that much, we want some money out of you.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.640]   Would life hacker ever consider such a thing, Adam?
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   No, I don't think so.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.640]   I can't imagine.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.160]   You're making too much money without it, huh?
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.960]   Well, you'll have to ask Nick Denton.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.960]   It's a galker, probably.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.080]   I think Nick's doing all right.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:54.520]   I think we can assume that next to an all right with display ads, essentially.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.760]   Yeah, the old newspaper model.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:01.440]   Highly targeted, good audiences, well sold, well positioned.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.280]   Yeah, Nick's brilliant at that.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.560]   The only reason I would love to go.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.560]   It's purely political.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.720]   I'd love to go micro payments is because then it disintermediates me.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.120]   You know, right now it's I have two audiences.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.360]   I have a bifurcated audience.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.280]   I have the advertisers and I have my audience.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.600]   And it feels like I'm selling my audience to the advertisers.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:27.840]   And what I'd love to do is, as much as we love our advertisers, and we try to handle
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.720]   that by picking advertisers I use and being very limited in the number of ads and the quality
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.600]   of ads we do.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.520]   But wouldn't it be nice to just say, hey, if you like to give me a buck, like a street
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:42.360]   busker and we'll have a direct conversation.
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.480]   If you like what you hear, pay for it.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   Isn't that seem like a cleaner transaction?
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:54.080]   I mean, it's definitely a cleaner transaction, but I just don't see the consumer willingness
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.800]   to jump on something like that.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.760]   It's really limited to whether or not anyone will do it, as you obviously know.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:05.640]   And I just I don't see it happening, at least not the way things are now.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:12.480]   And a good micro payment system, which has been lacking all along, wouldn't fix that
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   problem.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:19.160]   No, it's we've got to look at the bottom line of a total P and L. And I think what's happening
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.400]   in the industry right now, because they're in such a panic, is they're trying to preserve
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.840]   one old revenue line because we used to have it.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.880]   No, I'm with you on that, that that's the wrong reason to do it.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.880]   Right.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.360]   I mean, if you if you could, you know, the other way people look at it is, is there a
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.640]   premium version of Twitch?
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.400]   What does premium really mean?
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:42.280]   You know, I don't you know, I don't do that because then you get in the police business
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.960]   and I have a very clear example of this, my syndicator for the radio show, premier radio
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:54.040]   networks, does sell streams of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:55.040]   You can buy us.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.240]   You can't listen to Rush Limbaugh on the internet unless you pay for it.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.920]   You can't listen to coast to coast unless you pay for it.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:05.640]   And I've talked to the guy who manages this and he says, I spend most of my day finding
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:08.800]   pirate streams and squishing them.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   Because you're exactly right.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:18.600]   The people who love Rush the most are the most incented to steal it.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:22.120]   And in their view, distribute it and market it and promote it.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.120]   Right.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.040]   And so why are you stopping them?
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   Why not let them do that?
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.160]   And at the same time, you take advantage of that.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.160]   Sorry.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:35.160]   At the same time, once you're getting pirated, you probably do have a large audience still
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:41.000]   that's not going there because a lot of times, to me, the reason why something like Hulu
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.440]   is such a success is that it's easier than finding it and downloading it on BitTorrent.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.440]   Point of access.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.600]   And people are completely willing to watch an ad if they don't have to hunt it down somewhere
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   else.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.800]   Like if you have a single point of access that's the easiest.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:06.080]   And sometimes I feel like that is the only way where you could pay a little bit.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:13.200]   I think pricing schemes are pricing is a lot of the problem.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:21.920]   I think in the software world for so long, applications would cost like 10 to 20 to like
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.040]   several hundred dollars depending on it.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:28.640]   And now the iPhone app stores come out and applications are a dollar or two dollars and
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:34.720]   people will pay for them like crazy even though no one wants to pay like $10 or $20 for an
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.720]   application.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:41.960]   I think those sorts of like changes, I guess, those shifts if they could happen in some way
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.520]   in the publishing world.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.880]   I guess there's potential.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:53.720]   I mean, I don't see the straight road from one point to another, but it happens in other
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.320]   things, I guess.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:59.880]   Well, that software is the exact opposite model where there are some software guys trying
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:05.480]   to make money and advertising, but for the most part, I don't know how well that works.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:10.760]   I suspect it doesn't work well because you don't see it kind of ubiquitous.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.920]   Although it may be on the iPhone, I just saw an article by somebody who said, "If you're
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:19.800]   charging for your iPhone app and not putting ads, why aren't you putting ads in it?"
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.080]   You make much more money if you get that many more impressions than you would for a buck
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   99 on an app.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.480]   Yeah, I did read something.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:30.680]   I think it was probably published by one of the iPhone ad provider people.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.680]   Probably.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.680]   You plug into your app.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.680]   Right.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.280]   I'm claiming that people were making a lot of money that way.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   Right.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   I don't know.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:47.240]   My Red Troll and Charms suggests the premium edition I would wear a tie and neck tie.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.920]   We give you the premium edition of this show for free.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   There is...
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   That's true.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   That's true.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   And I don't want to police it.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.640]   I don't want to be playing whack-a-mole with people who did try to do that.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.920]   Remember, "Dig Nation," they said, "If you pay us a little money, you get a little sooner."
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.020]   And they stopped doing it because so many people would just...
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.640]   Our audience is technologically sophisticated enough that they just get around it.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.080]   Maybe Russia's audience isn't, but our audience is.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.600]   Dig Nation's audience just took it and put it out.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.400]   They finally gave up and said, "I guess this isn't going to work."
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400]   All right.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.600]   We'll keep running ads.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.600]   Just a few.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   Not a lot.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:25.400]   I also see here in the chat that they're clamoring for Twit on Hulu or PlayOn or places like that.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   Working on it.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.840]   That's just a matter of time.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.840]   Working on it.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.600]   Going to make that possible.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.520]   Let's wrap her up because I know it's Pete tonight in the Jarvis household.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.000]   There it is.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.760]   We usually end up the show with Gina's tip of the week.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.520]   Jeff's stat of the week and my tool of the week, but since Gina's not here, Adam Pash
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.680]   from Life Hacker with his tip of the week, Adam?
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.680]   All right.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.960]   Well, I'm actually going to give you...
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.440]   Because we didn't talk about one of the...
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.720]   Or a couple of the things that happened in Google Voice this week.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.520]   I'm going to give you a three-pronged Twig tip.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.120]   The first two are related.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.360]   They're Google Voice ones, but since a lot of people don't have Google Voice, I'll throw
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.880]   in a third for Gmail that everyone has.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:15.320]   Earlier this week, Google Voice enabled SMS forwarding to your email.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:22.800]   Then you can now reply to SMSs that you get through Google Voice from your email.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.640]   You never have to open your phone if you don't want to.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.520]   It's very handy if you're just sitting at your desk.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.920]   They also...
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.840]   Gmail Labs added a new feature called...
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:37.120]   I'm not sure, but basically what it does is embeds a little Flash player that you can...
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:43.760]   When you get a voicemail from Google Voice sent to your Gmail inbox, it'll have the transcription.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.960]   And below that, you get a little Flash player that you can play back the voicemail inside
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.960]   Gmail.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.960]   Oh, look at that.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960]   Right.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960]   So that might be...
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   So that might be...
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:59.080]   Inside Gmail, if you go into Gmail Labs and turn on the feature, which is called...
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.000]   It doesn't in Google Voice right now.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   Right.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.680]   You can already do it in Google Voice, but now it'll happen in your Gmail account as well.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.320]   And actually, when you listen to the message in your Gmail account in that same little
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.520]   inline playback, it will mark it as red in Google Voice, so you don't have to go to Google
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520]   Voice and...
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520]   So they're all tied together.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.520]   It's all tied together.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.520]   That's fine.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.240]   So voice tips, both things that happen this week.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   So my Gmail tip is for anyone who doesn't like the ads in the sidebar of Gmail.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   Yes.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:41.080]   So this was in August when we ran across this at Life Hacker.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:46.840]   A blogger by the name of Joe McKay discovered that Gmail will get rid of their contextual
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:52.760]   ads if your email contains tragic enough words.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.840]   I remember this, yeah.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.400]   So we put together a sentence that you could put in your signature if you so...
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.000]   Oh, let me have that.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Yes.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   Okay.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.400]   Our sentence, and you can tweak this in many different ways, whatever you...
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.760]   Our sentence is, "I enjoy the massacre of ads.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.280]   This sentence will slaughter ads without a messy bloodbath."
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.080]   So when Gmail reads the message for the contextual ads and it sees massacre and slaughter and
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.200]   bloodbath, it assumes that you don't want...
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.000]   I'm probably rightly assuming that you don't want the look at ads related to that.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.720]   I enjoy the slaughter of ads.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.760]   This sentence will...
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.400]   I enjoy the massacre of ads.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:38.680]   The sentence will slaughter ads without a messy bloodbath.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.680]   And actually, there's even...
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.120]   I don't know if you can do this by default or you have to turn on a Gmail Labs feature,
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.880]   but someone recommended you could take that and make the text of the signature white so
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.040]   no one would even see it.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.440]   I'm all for ads supported services, so I don't send...
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.600]   Well, isn't this ironic how we're talking about free stuff and yet we're also talking
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.760]   about how to kill the ads that makes the free stuff possible?
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.760]   But it's a fun little trick.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.800]   Make that your signature then.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.320]   I enjoy the massacre of ads.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.800]   This sentence will slaughter ads without a messy bloodbath.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   So if you send someone and someone, it won't have ads.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.920]   Adam, there's got to be somebody at Google right now who's trying to pick the exact right
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.520]   ad to go with that.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.920]   You've got to be careful though.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.240]   I don't have to be a jerk to us.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.880]   You've got to be careful though.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880]   Oh, that's so fun.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.320]   Chicken soup for the geek.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:37.960]   Yeah, something about how free is the future of the internet maybe.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:38.960]   Right.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.960]   It'll all be the benefits to ad...
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   A link to Chris's book perhaps on Audible.com.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.560]   Hey, great.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.960]   Thanks for three tips.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:56.440]   And one I've already enabled the playback in here in my Gmail for my Google voice, which
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440]   is fantastic.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.920]   That's very exciting.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.480]   In fact, I can do it now.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.000]   It's got exactly the same player, which is really slick in the Gmail that has a Google
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   voice.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   I love that.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   So thank you.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.760]   Very handy tip.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   Once again, Google does it again.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.560]   And now it's time for Jeff Jarvis and our number of the night.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.760]   The number of the night is 5 million.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.000]   That according to the Google official blog is how many students are going back to school
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.200]   this fall using Google Apps and Google Apps Education Edition as part of what they're doing.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:36.080]   That's in 145 countries up 400 percent, which is pretty amazing.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.000]   I think it's more than just bragging.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.520]   I think it's more important as an indicator of the disaggregation of education that can
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520]   come.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:51.440]   If students and educators are all on Google in this way, they can do amazing things.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:55.040]   My students in my entrepreneurial journalism class at City University of New York, where
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:07.960]   I teach, are creating a service called notebook, a KNOW notebook, as a platform for the Internet
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:13.120]   science and technology students and teachers to share news and curriculum.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.720]   Zephyr Teachout has a column in tomorrow's Washington Post that I link to on my blog,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.480]   Buzzmushing, about a disaggregated future of education.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:26.840]   I then link to my chapter in what would Google do.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:31.560]   And with the whole idea, so I think that part of the argument we're seeing is that what's
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:37.040]   happened to media in disaggregation is next going to come to education.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.320]   And I think the fact that there are 5 million students using Google Apps is in itself not
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.800]   very important, but it shows the infrastructure for education itself is going to change radically
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.440]   and fast.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.240]   At 5 million, I don't know what the total number of students in college is, something like
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   15.9 million.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:57.840]   This is, of course, across 145 countries.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840]   Ah, okay.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:04.240]   They also even put up a map showing which schools have already gone over to Google Apps as
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.920]   their primary means of collaboration.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:15.160]   According to facts for features from the census, 74.6 million students starting through, from
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.160]   nursery school through college.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:24.560]   So it's quite a few 53.8 million elementary and high school and.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.400]   Well, it's at least 20, 25 million.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.400]   Yeah, let me see.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400]   High school students.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.680]   I think it said the number of projected number of students enrolled in the nation's colleges
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.560]   and universities is fall, 15.9 million.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.280]   So 5 million, even if it's global, that's a significant number.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.760]   Yeah, it is.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.640]   And infrastructurally, now what the hell, one more Google wave mentioned because we haven't
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   had enough.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.200]   But if you go on to what Adam was saying earlier, you now look at collaboration.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.320]   If you think of Google Wave, I've been thinking about it as media.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.120]   If you think of Google Wave in the classroom.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   Yes.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.320]   And the classroom is now disaggregated across the world where the best students and best
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.960]   teachers find each other and collaborate on work.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   That's new.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   That's big.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.400]   You know, that was one of the changes that I thought was underreported, but most important
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:17.560]   about the changes Apple made to iTunes this week and to the iPhone with their 3.1 software.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.200]   They surfaced iTunes U on both, which is a great resource.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.040]   I mean, and if you look at, if you start browsing iTunes U the same way you browse the iTunes
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.880]   store, there's amazing stuff there.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.440]   Lectures from the best universities in the world.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.640]   You could get a full college education on your iPod.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.400]   I talked to the president of the New School in New York.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.960]   I don't think I mentioned this before, but he was saying, what do I do when I, there's
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.680]   all these great lectures at MIT and Harvard and Stanford.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:52.600]   And as we talked about it, brainstorming, we thought it's, you may consider kind of the
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.000]   UK version of the lecture and tutor.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.040]   So maybe New School in New York has a tutor who helps take the individual students through
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.680]   the work of the lecturers at MIT and Stanford and Harvard and Cambridge and Oxford.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.720]   And everybody gets a higher quality education in terms of getting the very best of the breed.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.720]   It's more efficient.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.080]   You don't have everybody teaching the same course, but you also then have the resource
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.960]   more targeted to more individual work.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:22.240]   And the business of the university, well, it's screwed just like media has been.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.320]   But it's good for the common wheel and that's what we really care about in the long run.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   They don't pay me much anyway.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.840]   So, devil and is saying in the chatroom that Google Wave works brilliantly for use at
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.560]   university, I use it with some of my fellow students to collaborate about notes from lectures.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.360]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.000]   I think collaboration is clearly like it's the most obvious thing in the first time you
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.520]   use it where you can see a lot of potential.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.120]   But I think that's the media application to Jeff.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.800]   We're going to use it to collaborate with our audience.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.800]   Right.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800]   Exactly.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   That's the future of news.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.360]   By the way, I do want to give you a plug, Adam.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.480]   Actually Gina wrote this article.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.240]   Gina Trapani gets the plug really.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.880]   She wrote an article, seven easy ways to integrate your Google Apps.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.560]   It's at lifehacker.com.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.760]   So for those 15 million students now using Google Apps in school, integrate them all
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.960]   together.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.160]   And she's got some great tips in there.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.880]   As always, even when Gina's not here, she's the best.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   Yes.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.640]   My Google tool of the week is something you've both alluded to, I think, already.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.400]   It's something that's out of Google UK.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.680]   And it kind of talks a little bit about toward what we were talking about it with Google
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.320]   having a lot of interesting information.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.760]   If you could but extract it or find a way to get that information out of it.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.360]   It's a Google Internet stats.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.320]   I don't know why it's only google.co.uk.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.720]   But maybe they're going to make it worldwide.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.400]   But if you Google Google Internet stats, you'll find it quickly.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.520]   Every time you refresh the page, you get a new stat.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.120]   For instance, this one, search made up 40% of online advertising in Western Europe in
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.120]   2008.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.440]   Some of it's more interesting than that.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.920]   But you can keep clicking.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.840]   95.1% of users connected to the internet in the UK are on broadband connections.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.520]   I tweeted this today and somebody came back and said, "Oh, good.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.720]   A new time suck."
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.720]   It really is.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.680]   I mean, you got consumer trends, macroeconomic trends, media consumption, media landscape
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.360]   and technology.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.240]   And it's just factoids.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.960]   It's just a ton of factoids.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.840]   I probably could have searched here for university students and found that information much more
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.840]   quickly.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   Let me see.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.000]   Just out of curiosity.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   Google Internet stats.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.240]   I can give you the link.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240]   It's a long one.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.240]   Nope.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.080]   It's not in there.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.080]   But there are a lot of...
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.080]   Maybe it is.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.080]   It's doing a search right now.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.400]   But it's just a really...
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   You're right.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.120]   Another Internet time sink.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.840]   Just browse around and find cool stuff.

[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.680]   Twig VM.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.080]   If you're outside the US, that's plus 1.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.080]   979.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.080]   589.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.080]   4486.

[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.520]   We do do that show live every Saturday at 2.15 Pacific time.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.400]   That's 5.15 Eastern or 2115 UTC.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.560]   So please tune in at live.twit.tv.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.880]   Listen to the show after the fact on iTunes or any of the other podcast aggregators.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.680]   And if you've got a thought about anything we said, we'd love it if you'd call us.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   97.95.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.480]   Twig VM.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.880]   Adam Pash is with Life Hacker.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.280]   He's the editor in chief.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.040]   So nice to have you on the show today, Adam.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.040]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.040]   Yeah, thanks a lot.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040]   We really appreciate it.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.240]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com, the author of The Fantastic.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.240]   What would Google do?
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240]   Available on Audible.com.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:52.280]   They're going to see a big hit on Audible.com and say, "He did it, didn't he?
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.080]   He recommended the book, damn him."
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.000]   But also, we wish you the best Jeff is going into surgery.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Now I'm not telling tales out of school when I say that because he's blogging about it
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.640]   for the last couple of months.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   He lives in public.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.160]   So I'll tweet out of the operating room.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.160]   No, really?
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.160]   Do you think so?
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.160]   I want to see...
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.160]   You know what I want is the recovery tweet.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.160]   That's going to be a new meme.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   Wow.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.160]   I see stars.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.280]   I see stars.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.600]   So tomorrow, are you going tomorrow morning?
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.160]   No, Monday morning.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.160]   Monday morning.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.160]   Okay.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.160]   All the best to Jeff.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.400]   And here's the amazing thing.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.640]   This man is going to be back on the show next week.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.720]   He doesn't take time off for nothing.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.720]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.720]   I'll show you my scars.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.880]   No, I don't want to see your scars.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   Thank you.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.880]   Where did...
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.720]   No, I'll ask you after this.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.720]   No, you don't want to know.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.720]   I'll tell you the next one.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.720]   I'll ask you after.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.520]   We're roughly the same age.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.520]   No, no, no.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.240]   Sure, it's on my docket as well.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.240]   Sometime down the road.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.240]   So...
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.240]   It's your PSH.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.240]   Yeah, I do.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.240]   I'm going on Monday actually to get a PSH check.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.240]   I'm going to say...
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.240]   I'm getting...
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.680]   I want the Jeff Jarvis tests right there.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.680]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.880]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.880]   Bye-bye.
