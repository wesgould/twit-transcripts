[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.200]   We're going to talk about the Instagram mess.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.680]   What does it really mean?
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.560]   And Microsoft steals Santa from Google.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.160]   Google retaliates and we get the strangest message from Santa ever.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.080]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.360]   Netcast you love from people you trust.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.720]   This is Twig.

[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.520]   This is Twig this week in Google, episode 177, recorded December 19, 2012.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.600]   Hello, cutie pants.

[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.680]   and learn more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.680]   This is Twig this week in Google to show the covers of the Google, but also the cloud,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.000]   the Twitter, the Facebook and today the Instagram.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.120]   Gina Trepani is here.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.840]   Founding editor lifehacker.com.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.280]   She's of course a blogger at smartaward.org, a programmer.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.200]   He's written to do.txt and think up.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.360]   I bet she's pretty happy we're going to ask her about the new Twitter policy.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.560]   She is joining us from San Diego.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.600]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.360]   Hello, and brand new co-host of all about Android.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.640]   Oh, yeah, it's public now.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.080]   We can tell the world.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.600]   Yes, I'm so excited.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.120]   We're really thrilled.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.200]   The founding host Eileen Rivera got a job with Google,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.760]   which I think causes us her to be recused.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.200]   She couldn't cover anything and it had to do with Google.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.960]   So that pretty much eliminates her in the Android show.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.920]   So we got Gina though.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.880]   I think that's great.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.840]   In fact, you'll add the developer's perspective, which is fantastic.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.400]   Yes.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.200]   I can't possibly replace Eileen.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.400]   I know Eileen started a sort of a labor of love, right?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.880]   Absolutely.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.200]   This is a show she wanted to do herself and she's done so amazing.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.880]   I'm not going to replace her, but I'm really honored to have the opportunity.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.440]   And I never thought I would do a podcast and now I'm doing three.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.560]   So I'm not going anywhere.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.000]   Folks in the chat room.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.480]   I'm not leaving the way.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah, they were worried you might leave this show.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.640]   You better not.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.480]   No, no, absolutely not.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   We cannot replace you guys.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.600]   It would allow that to happen.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.000]   No, no, we want more Gina, not less.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.240]   More Gina.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.200]   Well, hopefully you won't be sick of me once I start doing all that, Andrew.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.680]   I was thrilled.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.400]   And I know Jason and Ron are really thrilled to have you on board.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.000]   So you don't start till next year.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.040]   Right.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.120]   I start January 8th, I think is our first show.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.440]   Perfect.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.400]   This is my first show.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.760]   Next year isn't so far off.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.120]   Not so far off.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.600]   In fact, I think this is the last show of this year for us.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.400]   We can Google Next Week is a Best of Episode after Christmas.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.640]   And then the week following, we'll be here, but I'll be here, but you guys won't.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.840]   Just turns out that you're all busy.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.600]   It's okay.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.160]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.480]   Okay.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.480]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York where he teaches journalism.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.160]   He's also, of course, and a claimed author, his latest book, Public Parts,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.320]   his blog is at buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   And from Search Engine Land, Danny Sullivan, we love having Danny on.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.640]   Absolutely the most astute observer of search has been doing it for.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.520]   When did you start?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.040]   It was Search Engine Watch when you started.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.920]   When did you start that?
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.240]   96.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.640]   Wow.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.720]   There was no Google in 96.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.120]   There wasn't any Google in 96.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.920]   What did you cover?
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.800]   Altavista?
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.600]   It was Altavista.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.880]   It was Magellan.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.240]   It was Lycos.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.040]   It was Galaxy.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.760]   Wow.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.560]   It was a mess.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.120]   Galaxy.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   Galaxy.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.440]   I'm not sure.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   Now it's Google and Bing.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.560]   Google and also Rans.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.720]   And Yahoo occasionally.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.680]   Hey, we talked about this last week.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.360]   I think Marissa, it's like a train pulling out of the station where it goes,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.280]   and I think they're starting to gain a little steam on this Yahoo train.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.200]   The new Flickr app is great.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.760]   Not as good yet.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.200]   If only something had happened to cause them to play something that really inspired people.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.040]   You know, it's the problem.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.440]   You can make this great app, but everybody's using something else.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.560]   They're never going to switch over unless something happened.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   He's some kind of an instant mess-up.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.560]   Scandalor, Chabendron, or something.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.640]   It's the gate.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.560]   It's the gate, some Instagram.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.520]   Unfortunately, the Android version isn't quite as featured rich as the
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.320]   iPhone version, which is spectacular.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.360]   I'm sure we'll catch up soon, though, on the Android side.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.280]   So Flickr released a photo sharing app that shares to Flickr.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.120]   In fact, I renewed my Flickr Pro because of this.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.760]   Yay.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.440]   I've already posted something.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.880]   One of the nice things about the Flickr app on Android, like many Android apps,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.400]   you could choose the camera.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.160]   Once you take a picture, it has something very Instagram-like,
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.840]   a series of filters along the bottom.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.760]   And you've got to figure the program-
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.320]   - So you can turn them off in settings.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.440]   - You don't have to have them.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.080]   But the filters are nice.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.440]   You could take a really boring picture of cables and turn them into something
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.360]   lovely and abstract.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   - Filters are like the cool whip.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.720]   - It's cool whip.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.320]   It's cool whip.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.720]   - What's cool whip?
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.440]   - It's all-on-mode.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.320]   Not what's cool whip.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.800]   It's cool.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.360]   - Oh, yeah, it's cool.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.640]   - Yeah, it's an artificial chemical addition that we get.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.080]   - It's all-on-mode.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.040]   Hey, you know, there's a lot of photographers who are doing quite well with cool whip.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.320]   Don't knock cool whip.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.000]   So we talked about this last week, but the reason is Germanic.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.600]   It's almost as if they planned it,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.920]   is Instagram kind of put a foot in its mouth this week,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.320]   announcing new terms of service.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.240]   And the New York Times report was the one that I thought was most complete.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.680]   The CNET kind of got it wrong.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.640]   And I think, unfortunately, CNET said,
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.720]   Instagram wants to sell your photos.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.880]   And that became the story and an easy thing for Instagram to deny.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.840]   - Yeah.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.480]   - Right.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.080]   - No, we don't want to sell your photos.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.640]   Although technically they could.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.840]   Well, but Neelai Patel pointed out in the Verge,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.560]   Neelai does this.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.080]   He's real good at analyzing terms of service because he is, in fact, a lawyer.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.920]   And he pointed out that the old terms of service were much more open-ended
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.560]   and gave you a lot of Instagram, a lot of rights,
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.080]   which they just didn't assert.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.440]   So the new terms of service, they became more explicit.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:10.360]   But the things they asserted were kind of scary.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.800]   Things like, let me read you some of these.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.600]   Now they've actually backed out, haven't they, Danny?
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.680]   This is maybe, yeah.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.160]   - One of the things I always confuse everybody
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.680]   is the same problem with Facebook,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.400]   is you have to license your photo or your content to the platform you're using
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.800]   so that they can replicate it for you in various formats and various servers.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.400]   So that part is okay.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.960]   But to then use your likeness on the flower barrel would be wrong.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.600]   - Jenna Wirtham and Nick Bilton wrote about this a couple of days ago.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.560]   And their summary, now, again, these are,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.840]   this is the old terms of service.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.480]   Instagram has not issued revised terms of service,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.840]   but they said, all right, we're going to back down.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.120]   Instagram can share information about its users with Facebook,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.440]   its parent company, as well as outside affiliates and advertisers.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.760]   I'd be shocked if they weren't doing that.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.880]   But of course, you could start an advertisement without your knowledge.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.040]   This doesn't mean they're going to sell your image,
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.320]   but like, and I think it's somewhat like Facebook sponsored posts,
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.480]   this is the quote, "You agree that a business or other entity may pay us."
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.960]   This is why people thought they were selling photos,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.600]   but that wasn't, I didn't think that was going to happen.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.280]   "May pay us to display your username, likeness,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.040]   photos along with any associated metadata and/or actions you take
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.560]   in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.160]   without any compensation to you."
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.480]   I could see why people were a little miffed about that,
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.560]   but Facebook does something very similar, right?
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.280]   Mark Rothenberg said that the use of a person's likeness
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.720]   and ads could run into state laws,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.520]   easily with the EPIC, the electronic privacy information center,
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.800]   could run into some state laws,
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.520]   limiting the use of person's name or likeness for commercial purposes without consent.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   This is one that bothered me.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.080]   Under age users not exempt, although Instagram says people must be 13 years old
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.840]   to sign up for the service, the new terms note,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.280]   if a teenager signs up,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.360]   they're agreeing that a parent or guardian is aware that their image,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.840]   username, and photos can also be used in ads.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.240]   Bad enough you're advertising to kids,
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.560]   but just start using their images in ads.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.120]   Come on.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.960]   But so they're saying that these teenagers are letting their parents know about this
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.520]   terms, right?
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.440]   So they have to put that into for Kappa, right?
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.680]   So that's their way of saying
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.520]   part of our terms of service.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.160]   They use the teenager agreed that they'd let their parents know
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.760]   because we're not going to let them know.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:36.920]   Right.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.320]   And believe me, my 13-year-old totally reviewed all this stuff with me
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.280]   and caught my permission and it was all sorted out.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.240]   And I said, you could write it.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.000]   This one really bothered me.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.720]   You know what he said when I mentioned this last night?
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.200]   What?
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.080]   I get to be in an ad?
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.880]   That's pretty cool.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.160]   I'm going to make money off it?
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.440]   No, you don't get paid.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.160]   But he gets to be an ad and most kids would go, yeah, that's cool.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.720]   He was totally not bothered.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.240]   No, my kids neither.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.160]   Quote, you acknowledge we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.320]   or commercial communications as such.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   Now Twitter does that bothers me a lot.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.400]   That's just wrong.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.200]   Content creator, right?
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.240]   We all have that, you know, that's like the golden rule, right?
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.320]   As you let people know when something's an ad.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.760]   That's the thing that really bugged me.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.840]   So then other stuff.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.960]   And the other stuff.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.840]   Which isn't really a term type of thing.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:35.320]   It's just potentially a violation of some advertising laws and certainly best practices.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   But it's like, wow, really?
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.640]   Okay.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.280]   I just expect to see the word promoted or sponsored next to things that are ads on Facebook.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.840]   You know, that it says promoted sponsors on Twitter.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.680]   Promoted users are labeled as such.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.880]   When in search results, promoted tweets are labeled as such.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.560]   I just, I expect that on blogs.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.960]   I expect that in all sort of media experiences.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.160]   This is a thing.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.080]   Like if Leo likes, I don't know, Stamps.com on Facebook.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.920]   And I see an ad that says, hey, you're friend Leo like Stamps.com.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.880]   Yes, that's an endorsement.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.720]   But that's also like Leo, that was an action that Leo took on the service.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.520]   He's my friend.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:18.440]   So for me to see it feels like, okay, you know, I mean, it's getting surfaced because
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.080]   this brand presumably paid for it to get surfaced.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.520]   But that doesn't feel as bad to me as it not being labeled.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.120]   Yeah, there could seem to be a couple of differences.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.040]   First of all, Facebook, as you can see here, puts it under a column that says sponsored.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:39.320]   And they also, but this, I mean, this, they also only show me likes from my
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.640]   social graph, from my friends.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:48.520]   So, you know, if here's a Neil Dash liking Facebook developers, for instance.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.200]   Now, a Neil isn't doing, did not do an explicit endorsement of Facebook developers.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.240]   He liked that page.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.320]   Liking means a lot of things, by the way, in Facebook terms does not mean you like it.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   It means you associated with it in some way.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.000]   But a Neil is not getting that is, that is an implicit endorsement that
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Neil maybe did not want, but at least it's only going to a Neil's friends, right?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.280]   Instagram is not saying that.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.880]   Instagram is saying, you know, we could show it anywhere anytime.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.560]   And if it's me, I don't want that.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.400]   I'm not going to, I don't want Instagram using my image in endorsements.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.120]   There's, there's, there's a bunch of issues here.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.720]   There's a whole, whole raft of issues.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.760]   Well, when I went to time, when I was a time-man can start a magazine,
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.400]   a wise editor there said, listen, the rule is really simple.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.600]   The reader should never be confused about the source of content.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.200]   If it ever does, you pay it for it, you say it.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.680]   That's it.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.840]   All these rules have just come down to that.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.240]   Yes.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.120]   It's that simple.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.640]   And, and so it's an ethical issue of transparency.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.680]   Number two, the FTC has ruled that bloggers, for example, that do not reveal,
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.880]   not just getting paid, but getting freebies for things could be liable for,
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.160]   for not revealing, not being transparent about influence on them.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.800]   And number three, using your likeness in an advertising context is way, no, no,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.080]   no without your permission, right?
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.520]   And I've seen magazines that got in this trouble where they used some celebrities photo
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.280]   from the magazine in an ad as if the celebrity were then endorsing the magazine and they get
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.920]   zapped by the FTC and they get sued in court.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.040]   And I happen to find in a certain, oh, I don't know, book here.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.960]   Looks like public parts by Jeff Jarvis.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.640]   On page 64.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:37.640]   It was a 1902 case involving young Abigail Robertson's likeness on flower barrels,
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.480]   where a patient there without her consent.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.680]   And the New York Court of Appeals declared at the time, there is no present,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.680]   there is at present no writer privacy known in the law.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.000]   Wow.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.600]   This was a key moment here where they used her likeness in a commercial context and she had no
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:59.880]   right. The judge said that, hold on here a second, the so-called writer privacy,
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.720]   as the phrase just founded upon the claim that a man has a right to pass through this world,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.200]   if he wills without having his picture published, his business enterprise discussed,
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.240]   his successful experiments written up for the benefit of those,
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.480]   or his eccentricities commented upon in either hand-billed circuit of those catalogs,
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.240]   periodicals or newspapers. And he said, you couldn't stop all this because then you'd have to stop
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:26.840]   newspapers. That was the beginning of a part of the beginning of a discussion of writer privacy.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.720]   And what evolved out of that was the idea that you can't have your likeness presented
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.440]   as if you endorse without your specific approval.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   And that's not in New York.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.040]   Well, how does Facebook get away with this? Because Facebook's doing it and has been for some time.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.840]   Well, I guess I'm going to say that agreement with Facebook though.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.200]   Pardon me, Danny?
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.640]   That's part of your agreement with Facebook because somewhere is to be buried in the same
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.880]   time. So I did explicitly say they could.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.600]   Well, you know, somewhere where they're written.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.560]   You didn't say no.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.040]   Well, and you can opt out.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.640]   Yeah, there's opt out teachers, under settings.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.400]   And that's part of why I think you saw Instagram doing this too because, you know,
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.280]   the other thing that happened is in, as Facebook and Instagram, they're blending their privacy
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.160]   policies together. Facebook can do these things off of just the Facebook platform.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.080]   So this is an extension of what they're already doing.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.160]   By the way, this is the somewhere thing that happens on Google.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.600]   I mean, if you have a Google+ page and someone likes that Google+ page and then you run
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:30.040]   AdWords for that Google+ page, then potentially the people who like that Google+ page will show
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.120]   up in your AdWords. And even little, maybe a little thumbnails of their pictures might appear in some
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.120]   cases. So and I presume that at some place, we agreed to that as well.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.560]   And that all comes back to the whole adage that everybody keeps repeating again.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.160]   That is if you don't know what the product is, you are it.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.440]   Or if you're not paying for the product, then you are the product that we don't.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.120]   You know, I wish I should say Jeff, Jeff Powersack, Greg.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.760]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.560]   Rode.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.120]   Right. Derek.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.000]   Derek. I'm sorry. Derek.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Powersack wrote a great, great rebuttal to that.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.760]   But before we do that, I do want to make sure that people are up to date because less than a day ago,
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.840]   Kevin Sistrom responded on the Instagram blog. This is very much the Facebook MO, by the way,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.520]   exactly what Facebook's done time and time again, invaded privacy, then backed off.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:20.360]   He said, we're listening. Thank you. We're going to modify specific parts of the term to make it
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:26.200]   more clear what will happen with your photos. He says, look, advertising is one of many ways
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.160]   Instagram can become a self-sustaining business. Our intention in updating the terms is to communicate
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.200]   that we'd like to experiment with advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.120]   It was interpreted by many. We were going to sell your photos to others.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.040]   See, I think that is a red herring. I don't think that that was the issue. I don't know why
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.720]   CNET focused on that because that's not the thing. My takeaway wasn't that. This is not true.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.040]   Well, of course not. And it's our mistake that the language is confusing is not our intention
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.720]   to sell your photos. Okay. What is your intention? We envision a future where both users and brands
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.600]   alike may promote their photos and accounts to increase engagement and build a more meaningful
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:11.400]   following. Essentially, he's kind of saying we sponsored posts. It would be helpful to see which
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.760]   of the people you follow also follow this business. In some ways, some of the data you produce,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.160]   like the actions you take following an account and your profile photo might show up if you're
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:27.880]   following this business. So Leo Le Porte follows XYZ porn star. You might want to, too,
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.320]   kind of thing. The language you proposed also raised questions about whether your photos can
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.040]   be part of an advertisement. Now, this is interesting. We do not have plans for anything like this.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.680]   So we're going to remove the language that raised the question. They implied that they did by saying
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.800]   we reserve the right to do that, but they said, "Nah, we don't want to do that anyway."
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:54.840]   We don't assert ownership. I didn't think they did. You can set your photos to private,
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.000]   and then Instagram only shares photos of the people you've approved to follow you. So it's a Twitter
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.800]   model where normally on Instagram, everything's public unless you explicitly say, "No, no, I don't
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:11.640]   want my stream to be public." But why did they go through this needless kerfuffle?
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   Because it's the Facebook way. Push as hard forward as you can,
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:22.680]   and if somebody pushes back, "Oh, whoa, we didn't mean that." And if they don't, then yeah, go for it.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.480]   But Leo, I think it's more of the case. There's a
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.640]   assumption of difference here. If you put out newsfeed as an entirely new feature,
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.440]   and people say, "Oh, I don't know. It's new. I don't like it." And Mark says,
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.360]   "Okay, I may be this communicator, but trust me, this is something new. This is going to be good.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.280]   This is important." That's different from a legal document. They didn't,
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.440]   Instagram didn't change any features, didn't add anything of value to anybody. All it did
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.840]   was lawyers put out a document, and you could have shown this document to 10 average users,
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.400]   and they all would have said, "Are you knocking futs?" Right.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:59.000]   Although, again, Neil Ipatel says, it was worse because the language was, he said this before
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.840]   many times about terms of service. We get upset when they get more specific, but he said,
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.440]   "Really, it's worse to have a very vague TOS." That's the truth.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.680]   Because that gives them all the permission to do everything they want.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.760]   This is much better. But to kind of rebut that it's,
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.000]   when they're vague, that often I think reflects that they don't have specific plans. And when
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.960]   they get specific, then they have specific things that they want to do. And that's when I think
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.720]   some time, and anytime you go through one of these things, it's also a time when people will go
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.360]   through and finally pay attention to, maybe we should revisit this. I don't know that that's
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.880]   the only case that, "Well, they had all these huge rights before, but now they got specific,
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.680]   so it's better." What's better is that you actually understand what they can and can do.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.720]   Does it mean you have to like it? Right. And specific would be a lot better.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.200]   And I think that's part of the issue that Google had when they made their changes earlier this year,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.880]   was that they really kind of gave themselves a lot of broad abilities, even though they didn't
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.760]   have any intentions to do it. And it would be nicer, perhaps, alongside these legalistic
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.480]   documents that we get and these privacy things that we get, is that we also get a bill of rights.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.960]   What are you not going to do? People looked at the Google thing and they assumed,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.240]   "Well, now they're going to sell our search data to all these different people because they can do
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.720]   it." And Google would say, "Well, no, we're not going to do that." It's like, "Well,
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.480]   how do I know you're not going to do that? You haven't itemized it anywhere. So list the things
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:30.040]   that you absolutely will not do with our data and then we'll know." And that may be more useful to
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.120]   us as well as if you want to itemize the stuff that you are doing. That would certainly be helpful.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.480]   I will give them credit for saying, "Look, this only applies to pictures you post after these
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.560]   terms of service come into play January 16th." So if you've been using Instagram,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.840]   you don't have to delete all your photos because those are not in play,
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:57.080]   except that they are, if you believe Neelite, because they were under the old terms of service
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.520]   and they still can do anything they want with them. But they essentially said, "We're only thinking of
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:06.600]   doing this from January 16th on to pictures you post from that point on." My response was whether or
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.040]   not they roll back, they've indicated what they want to do and I just don't want to play. I would
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.360]   I don't want to be part of Facebook either, but you kind of have to. You don't have to be part of
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.960]   Instagram. Well, but I mean, a lot of large brands do these days. You know, the dates.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.800]   They understand that things are being shared there. And in fact, Instagram, it's just finally
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.200]   getting to the point where they're, this is a whole, in our take on marketing, part of thing was,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.800]   you know, our ankle was, had they already killed it before they get the marketers get a chance to
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.280]   actually do the things they want to do on this network that they do in other places. So, you know,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.080]   they seem to be trying to figure out how do we start paying for that $750 million that we actually
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.520]   cost Facebook or whatever it was in the end. But yeah, you're going to have major brands on there
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.560]   that are wanting to share stuff and they're not going to be able to get off. And you maybe have
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.320]   people who feel like, I still got to be there because chances are there's still going to be a
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.800]   huge audience that have to be out there. So so maybe you'll be back and yeah, you're right. I mean,
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.040]   that's why I left Facebook and why I had to come back. And I may might be the same for it certainly
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.680]   would be for the Twitter. The good news is, as I mentioned, the beginning flicker has a great app
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.080]   that has a lot of the same features. I paid right paid up my flicker pro. So I know they're making
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.480]   money on me. I presume that means they're less likely to try to do this kind of stuff, right,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.400]   Gina? Well, you explicitly set the terms under which your photos can be used on Twitter.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.440]   On on Flickr with the Creative Commons licensing, you know, model that they had they've had forever.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.160]   Flickr is this like this very old school web app that just got really dusty for a while.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:41.800]   And now sort of seeing seeing a comeback. My co-founder, Anil, you mentioned earlier, he did
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.560]   a great post this week called the web we lost. Yeah, I love this. It was a really great piece
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:53.320]   just about the way the things that people valued when they made web applications 10 years ago
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.800]   versus today, like data export and import and Creative Commons licensing and openness and
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.960]   collaboration. You know, now we have Twitter cutting off access to the social graph and Twitter,
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.720]   you know, disabled Instagram disabling Twitter cards. I mean, it's like these companies are
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:13.480]   active and we'll talk about a Google active sync or exchange later. It's like companies are now
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.880]   cutting off access to one another. But flickers was kind of that one of those old school,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:24.680]   like license your photos openly versus copyright them versus limited. And it's just, you know,
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:30.200]   it stores multiple copies of your, your high resolution photo versus applying a filter and
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.280]   cropping it, you know, it's just a really different kind of time. I'm happy to be back. I've been
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:39.000]   using Flickr ever since my daughter was born because I just, I really like the way that the app works
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.160]   and I like that the, you know, flickers values. And so I'm thrilled that all my friends are getting
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:49.080]   getting back onto it. Yeah. Yeah. Although, you know, add something, I did this story and it was in
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.840]   2009. It was called Flickr's Big Fail on Creative Commons attribution. And a lot of people will
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.440]   say, well, you know, Flickr's great because you can set your limitations and you can create a
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:04.680]   comment or whatever. But the creative common stuff is woefully inadequate in a lot of ways. It'll,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.320]   when you go through, it'll say things like, I license this only for non-commercial use
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.520]   and you have to attribute it. But there's still, I mean, I just looked at this a few months ago on
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.640]   Flickr, there's still no way to say the exact kind of attribution that you want. There's no kind of
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:26.040]   contact details that come along with it. So, you know, do I, if I take a photo off of Flickr,
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.760]   if I just say the Flickr person's name, was that attribution enough in the way that they wanted or
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.040]   did was a link required to have to link back to Flickr? There, there could be good improvements.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.960]   And one thing I'd hope that Flickr would take away from this is actually revisit some of those
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.440]   attributions and make sure that people can better specify what's involved with it.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.000]   Because they didn't create it. Creative Commons is a separate organization. But I think those are
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.760]   good ideas to Creative Commons. I don't know who the board is now. Joy, you know, has been on it for
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.600]   ages. I don't know if it's a Creative Commons problem though. I think Flickr just needs one more
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.840]   field that says, and that attribution, how would you like that to be? Exactly. Yeah.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.960]   Because what right now, when you, when you click on them, you'll, when you go to Flickr,
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.560]   you click on these things and it takes you to like a Creative Commons page. It says like, you know,
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:13.080]   you must attribute the work, a manner specified by the author and license or, and then, but when
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.720]   you post pictures to Flickr, you don't necessarily say it. And I, I think a bigger issue all this is
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:23.640]   just how the photo sharing services in general have still not evolved. You get these photos that are
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:29.400]   shared all over the place. And, you know, the mainstream media, which is consider it to be a
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.640]   help yourself type of thing. If they see the picture that's out there and then they grab it,
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.280]   some of them try to get in contact with people. Some people have no idea how you get in contact
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.520]   with someone to use a photo. So it still feels like when it comes to photos, especially when
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.920]   there's breaking news photos that people are sharing out there, that it's like the Wild West.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.720]   Well, that's, that's where the idea of selling photos actually is a good idea. If Instagram said,
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.280]   we will act as your agent. Right. And if a news organization comes to us, we'll supply your photo.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.600]   We will communicate that to you and we'll act like a PayPal for you. And we'll, and help you
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.080]   sell your photos. If you want to, or you can say, you can state that on there, that would have been
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.560]   pretty cool. Flickr should do the same thing. Big opportunity for Flickr here. And Twitter as well,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.640]   because Twitter takes and they host all their own photos as well. And people are doing that. And
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.240]   I agree that would be an ideal thing where people say, Hey, this is great. I'm not going to go out
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.640]   there and try to license my own photo. And if, and if you can do that for all these organizations,
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.880]   then great. But, you know, sign me up. Or if you really are concerned about it, you say no.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.760]   And that's indicated as part of your photos as well. This is not licensed for greater use unless you
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.320]   get in contact in some way. Is the backlash against Instagram overblown? Here's national
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:44.360]   geographic's response. They have almost 650,000 followers on Instagram. They got 40,000 likes on
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.680]   this. It says this is an Instagram photo. Nat Geo is suspending new post Instagram. We're very
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.760]   concerned with the direction of the proposed new terms of servitus. If they remain as presented,
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.680]   we may close our account. And that was the big one, right? That was the big one.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.040]   That was the big one. Certainly helped me realize national geographic was on Instagram.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.800]   You know, I didn't know they were either. I didn't either. I won't bother following them now.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:16.600]   Isn't for a point your photos off. But, well, notice they said we're suspending posting and we
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.680]   may close our account if these terms go into effect. See, this is the thing. I think that everyone
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.360]   had this knee-jerk reaction and deleted their account and then Instagram said, Oh, actually,
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.880]   we screwed up and we're going to we're going to revive this language. And I saw somebody tweet,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.160]   like, Oh, who wrote the tool where I can re-import my photos back in the interview?
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:37.720]   Little bit of knee-jerk reaction. This is what I was talking about in the op-ed.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.800]   I did it for the times that we were talking about last week is like, this isn't working.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.400]   This is the community working, right? So like Instagram puts out those terms and says,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.840]   this is going to go into effect in 30 days. The community criticizes it, forces them to clarify,
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.000]   forces them to say, actually, you know what, we never really meant to do that. So we shouldn't
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.280]   include that language. And then revising it. I mean, this is how things iterate. So I didn't
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:05.960]   delete my account. I've always sort of double-posted from Instagram and Flickr, like through Instagram.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.360]   Instagram always did allow you to post a Flickr at the same time because I wasn't sure if I was
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.440]   actually going to stick with Instagram. I didn't close my account. So I think Nat Geo actually
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.040]   did the right thing where they said, you know, we're just going to take a break. We're going to
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.400]   wait and see if this is actually going to go down the way that it did. And they got great press.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.920]   I mean, they put the pressure on Instagram. And right now we all know that Nat Geo is on Instagram.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:31.880]   John Blanton has a good point in our chat room, though. If there wasn't this strong reaction,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.360]   maybe Instagram would have not rethought. That's true. Absolutely true.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:43.240]   So it had the effect intended. We'll see what their responses. Getting to Derek Poisek's post
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:50.120]   on his blog, poisek.com. This is actually good. I'm glad. I've used this phrase to
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:56.040]   came from, I think it came from Reddit post. If you're not paying for the product, you are the
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.160]   product, the implication being that maybe you're paying for Flickr so you don't have to worry so
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:06.920]   much. But if you're getting Facebook and Instagram and Google for free, then maybe they're selling
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:12.760]   you to somebody else, his point is, no, that's not necessarily true. First of all, there's a
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:19.880]   couple of false assumptions. In many cases, an example would be this show. It's a free product,
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.800]   but advertising supported. Free media is a very popular form of media. He also says,
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.840]   there's some assumption that you pay a company, they're going to treat you better. There's no
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:35.720]   evidence of that. He says, I can answer this with one word, AT&T or Comcast or Wells Fargo.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.560]   So his point, I think, is well taken, which is, we should stop using that phrase.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.360]   It's always been the media model. The audience has sold the advertiser and that's what supports
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:54.200]   the premium. It's not anything new. Yeah. And it's nothing so bad about it, as long as it's an
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:00.040]   explicit trade. The thing I don't like, I just don't like the idea that Instagram is going to
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.360]   want to start using my image. It's the same thing, exactly the same thing Facebook was doing.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:11.960]   Of course, we're going to take a break. We will have more Instagram is done. You can now
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.320]   take your head out of the sand. You can take off the filter off this screen now,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.800]   because I know already it doesn't take long in this news cycle. 24 hours into this,
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.480]   people in the chat are saying, I don't want to hear any more about it. I'm done with it.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:33.000]   Nice filter though. I like that. The new, this is the new Willough filter from Instagram.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:39.960]   Andy Sullivan is here. Search engine land.com. Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com and
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:47.560]   Gina Trappani from smarterware.org. I show today brought to you by stamps.com. See, this is an ad.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:54.040]   This portion is an ad. This is me doing an advertisement. You mean they pay you for this?
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:31:01.800]   I get paid and the money that we receive for doing this ad pays for all that you see here,
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.480]   which is believe me, not cheap. Oh, I feel like the product. You are the product.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.920]   Actually, Danny Sullivan is the product.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:18.520]   Well, it's challenging. When I started the tweet, I thought, well, maybe we could do this
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:25.480]   user supported because I'd love to just have a direct correlation. But as many have realized,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:30.040]   especially when you're talking about media, people are used to free media as supportive media.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.440]   They're not going to pay you. By the way, thank you, steps.com.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.400]   Yeah. Exactly. Thank you.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.440]   And we're picky. We don't want you to have a handful of advertisers. We
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:45.400]   they're selected carefully. We don't let just anybody advertise. We've used quite a few advertisers,
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.920]   in fact, because we want to have a nice correlation between the audience and the advertiser.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.760]   Stamps.com is a good example. This is a service. Now, the other thing that we do
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:59.640]   is it's just very straightforward. Tell me what the service is. We give you a free trial. If you
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.640]   want it, you got it. If not, you don't have to do anything about it. The only negative is I'm
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.160]   going to take a little bit of your time talking about it. That's all. And you can fast forward
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.000]   through this if you want. On the other hand, if you do a lot of mailing, you might want to listen
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.600]   because stamps. Oh, I left my scale on my office. The new scale is here with stamps.com. So what
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:23.640]   is stamps.com? It's the pro way to mail so you never have to go to the post office. It means that
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.680]   you can do everything you do at the post office right from your desk, which means buy and print
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.320]   US postage. No postage meter now, by the way. I don't know what the people who do postage
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.680]   meters are going to do about this. You just use your computer and your printer. You already got
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:43.480]   everything, any special ink or anything. You can also, the mail carrier will come and get the mail.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:50.280]   So you can print right on the envelope. So if you're doing invoices or mailers or anything like that,
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.920]   print right on the envelope, return address. The address is taken from your address book or
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.720]   QuickBooks. If you use that, your logo, company logo, all this printed automatically by stamps.com,
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.440]   even the postage legal postage right on the envelope, it actually looks more professional
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.840]   than having a stamp on the envelope. It looks like you do this for a living. If you're an Amazon
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:14.920]   eBay Etsy PayPal, if you sell stuff online, all the fulfillment can be handled by stamps.com. They
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.240]   take the address from the website. They fill out all the forms if necessary. If you're sending

[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.200]   the tracking number. And they've got this great USB scale. You plug this into the computer,
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.400]   you plop the envelope or the package up to 25 pounds on here. And the software does the rest.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.360]   It says, "Yeah, got it." Now, I'm going to show you how you can get this scale for free and a trial
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.080]   of stamps.com, a no risk trial offer. This is why I like our advertisers. They almost, I think,
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:49.960]   to a man and a woman. They all offer free trials. $80 bonus. Wait a minute, no. Click that microphone
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:57.400]   and enter the word twig. Is that a word? Yeah, twig. And now the $80 offers a $110 bonus offer
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.840]   that includes the scale. You pay shipping and handling for that. That's about five bucks.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.880]   You get the supply kit worth five bucks to make up for that. You get $55 in free postage
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.560]   that you can use over a few months time and a four-week trial. It's all from stamps.com.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.840]   This is a great way, especially in the month of December, which is amateur hour at the post office.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.920]   Stay out of the post office. Get your mail and done like a pro with stamps.com.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.720]   And yes, we thank them for their support of the show, making this possible.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:36.520]   You mentioned, this is an interesting story, that Google is turning off Microsoft's active sync
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:42.360]   exchange, which means if you use Windows phone, Google is not a good choice for you.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:50.520]   Is that what it means, Gina? That's what it means. Yeah, so active sync is, and actually,
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.320]   I use the exchange exchange sync on my iPhone as well. But that's okay. Exchange sync will still work.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:01.480]   Yes. I map works. I map works. Well, so there's a difference. There's there's I map in card
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.560]   dab and cal dev. Right. But then that's what the iPhone uses. Right. That's what the iPhone
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:14.600]   uses. Right. Right. So this means that basically Gmail users won't be able to sync their Google
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:20.200]   calendar contacts and email to Windows phones using the Windows phone email app.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.760]   Does that sound right? Yes. I get that. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.760]   That's going to stop working in January 30th.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.280]   Microsoft could do what Apple did and support iMap that works with Gmail, CAD, Cal dev works with
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:43.080]   calendar and card app works with contacts. Google also has said earlier that they're not going to
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:49.240]   make a Gmail app for Windows phone and has no plans to make Windows apps for any of its apps.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.760]   I Apple still work on Windows phone though, won't it? I mean, when I set up Windows phone
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.400]   with mail, it was an iMap account, I'm pretty sure. I don't think so.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.800]   iMap will work. This is the issue. This is for email, calendar, and contact.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.640]   I don't think you have that option on a Windows phone.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.920]   Really? Hey, yeah. Is that I don't have mine upstairs. So I can't look right now, but
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.200]   I just want the support. The email client and when the phone doesn't support iMap.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.920]   I'm happy. That can't be right. I'm happy. That's the standard. Can't be right. See,
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.480]   I mean, I'm pretty sure it will still. So I think the
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:31.080]   I really calendar in context. Yeah. Windows phone, I'm pretty sure will support any
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:36.760]   iMap account because you can have an other email account and you go through and you do all the
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.240]   settings, you have to do it manually. And in fact, Windows phone has been pretty awesome in the
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:46.600]   fact that I can give it a Google apps, which is a Gmail account that you actually, you know,
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.760]   have in your own domain. I can give it that account. It is actually always set up the iMap
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.000]   settings better than an Android phone will do. Android goes, I don't know what this is all about.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.920]   It's a Google apps account. I can't handle it. And Windows phone goes, oh, yeah, I know what it is.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.720]   Your security is SSL. You know, it does it all. So I think it'll set it up. But I think the
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.240]   difference is that it's not going to automatically push email to you in the way that I guess exchange
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:15.560]   sync will do it. So you'd have to have your phone itself constantly checking, which I mean, I just
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.960]   check manually anyway, because I like to get my battery going. So it's not been an issue for me.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:25.400]   And so I'm pretty sure you can still get your email through Windows phone using the iMap protocol.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:32.680]   And that's not a problem. But the calendar, I know, has been absolutely awesome in that my
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.520]   Windows phone will go through ink with my calendar and everything. And I don't know how it's doing.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.200]   It just knows that I have a Google account. And it's been talking to the Google account. And it
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.200]   sounds like the calendar, as well as the contacts are about to go poof. And you're going to be out
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.520]   of luck on that unless Microsoft changes to another format on their end, right?
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:54.360]   So you have a whole bunch of apps that are like Internet Explorer hasn't been on the Apple for
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.240]   two or three years now. You can't get Skype on Chrome, which means they're no Chromebook, and you
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:06.280]   now can't get Gmail natively on Windows phone. It's this little game that goes on. It's in
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.520]   the end, you own Windows, here on this, you own the competitor. I just don't think it, you know,
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.560]   look at the experience, which we'll talk about in a few minutes, I'm sure, with Google and maps
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.720]   on the iPhone. At some point, isn't it still in your benefit to serve customers no matter what
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.360]   they're using? Well, it is. And in fact, this is where Google gets, I think, very hypocritical in
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:29.960]   some of this stuff. And let me say, I don't know enough technically on whether or not Google is
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:35.400]   using a common standard that would be easy for Microsoft to support or not when it comes to contacts
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.800]   and calendars. I can't tell on that. But when you say things like, well, Google doesn't want to
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.880]   write a Gmail app for Windows phone because a Gmail app is not required to get your mail from Gmail.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:54.920]   In fact, I hate using the Gmail app on the iPhone and on Android because I prefer to have my messages
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.000]   be discrete. And I prefer email clients that actually loop them into a conversation, but show
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.720]   them as discrete individual messages in that conversation, which Windows phone will support
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.600]   iPhones native client will do it. And on Android, it is all over the place as to whether or not any
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:14.280]   of the email clients will do it. But Google's not actually written a Gmail client for Windows phone.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.960]   And it's similar. Somebody just said, MXX just said, you can get Gmail natively on Windows phone.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:27.640]   I don't know. So I'm confused. And Android phone has an email client. And then you can also get a
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:35.240]   Gmail client. It's designed to work with Gmail and give you a more Gmail-like experience. But
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.200]   Gmail itself, it's just an email service. So any email client can interact with that service.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.440]   Here's Microsoft's response. And this is maybe is what confused me.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.560]   Really want to do some winter cleaning switch to outlook.com for the best email experience
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:54.120]   across all your devices. We were very surprised to see Gmail announced last week they'll soon
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.920]   end support for EAS, unless of course you're willing to pay Google for your email will still
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:04.120]   work on the apps platform. It means that many people currently losing Gmail for free or facing
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.840]   a situation where they might have to degrade their mobile email experience by downgrading to an
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:14.680]   older protocol. Okay, I guess that's IMAP. That doesn't sync your calendar or contacts.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.920]   Doesn't give you direct push of new email messages and doesn't have all the benefits
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   of EAS. So they're saying just use outlook.com and a web browser on your phone. And then you'll be fine.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:35.400]   I set up my iPhone. I used an exchange account to set up my Gmail because to sync contacts and
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:41.160]   calendar because that was the sort of best way that people in the know kind of new to sync
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.200]   contacts and calendar and email. Actually, I didn't sync email because I just used the Gmail client.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:52.440]   So what they want you to do is forward your Gmail to outlook.com and then use
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.200]   Microsoft's outlook.com on your mobile device. That doesn't say this calendar contacts issue.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:04.040]   No, that's part of the problem with outlook is like outlook can mock outlook.com can mock the
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   idea that IMAP is an older protocol, but it's actually a newer protocol than pop, which outlook
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:15.640]   supports doesn't support IMAP, which is insane. One of the number one reasons I wouldn't use
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:20.520]   outlook is because I don't have IMAP support. And if you have IMAP support, then you have the
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.960]   ability to sync your mail. The big advantage to IMAP is that you're reading your email on your
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:31.320]   iPhone and you delete or archive a message and then you go to your desktop and your desktop knows
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:37.240]   exactly what happened on your other phone. They're syncing and they know your exact status. And
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.560]   I'm juggling four different phones sometimes and I've got two or three different computers and
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:46.360]   IMAP makes all that all happen. But I couldn't do that on outlook unless I used EAS, I guess,
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.600]   which I've never even bothered with because IMAP has been fine. But the calendar in the
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:58.440]   context stuff is a big problem. Absolutely. So who's bad here, Google or Microsoft seems
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:06.280]   like Google's the one turning the capability off. It's hard to say because I don't know enough about
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:13.080]   exchange active sync and how common that is or not common. I would probably put more of the bad
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:17.560]   part on Google because why are you changing something that was probably already working?
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.080]   Right. It seems spiteful. Seems a little spiteful.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.240]   Well, and then we'll continue to work for paying customers. So Google's making the bet that people
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:31.320]   who are using Windows Phone have the money in the corporate organization that will pay for Google
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.680]   apps. So it does feel a little bit like, oh, you kind of like the Google Apps free accounts going
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.600]   away. It's like, oh, you hooked a lot of people with the free offering for a certain amount of
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.680]   time and now saying, hey, you got to pay for this. So slightly troubling to me, like, okay,
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.280]   this is becoming a pay for service now.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.560]   I think you also have to put that in the context of other things that Google's done.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:03.080]   So I spend a lot of time with Google Voice and actually trying to get Google to explain to me
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:08.760]   why I can't get a Google Voice app for Windows Phone. Because since I use Google Voice as my primary
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.840]   number, not having a Google Voice account on Windows Phone is a problem for me,
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:18.360]   because I can't dial out for my own number. And worse, if I want to still use the Google Voice
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.680]   account in some way, there's no web-based interface that's functional. I actually have to go to a
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:28.360]   third-party app. And I have to trust a third-party app with not just my Google Voice account information,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:34.520]   but my entire Google account information. So this is a security issue. And there are significant
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:39.560]   numbers of people who use Windows Phone and Windows devices. It's not anywhere near Android,
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.640]   not anywhere near the iOS, but there are still significant numbers of people. So it's like,
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.280]   why are you, first of all, why are you producing a potential security issue for people by not
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.600]   supporting this? Because it is probably not hard for you to come up with something. But secondly,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:57.160]   aren't you the same company that through a hissy fit when you couldn't get Google Voice approved for
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:04.600]   iOS? And you threw that in. You wanted the audience over at iOS. But you didn't say it like,
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.000]   oh, we wish we were on iOS because there's a significant audience there that we want to reach.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.480]   You make it all sound like this is a fairness and its equality and its rights and access and
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:21.000]   everything else. And when that's not really the case, the case is we want to be on iOS because a
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.520]   lot of our audience is there and we think we need to be involved with it. But we don't give a toss
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.240]   about Windows Phone, especially in terms of even possibly helping it emerge as a competitor because
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:36.120]   it's not that many people there. So we'll bother. But when it came to growing out Windows 8 and
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.240]   Windows 8 made some significant changes on how your search default changes and how you get to have
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.480]   a search default provider, suddenly it's like we cannot at Google get a search app out fast enough
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:52.840]   to make sure that you can keep getting Google the way you want to have Google. Because in that case,
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:57.080]   the Windows system is big enough that they actually care about it. They didn't do anything like,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:02.440]   well, gosh, we can't support everybody and we don't know what we're going to do. And
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:08.040]   goodness knows people could just find us directly by going to Google. So yeah, I've
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.720]   pounded disappointing more on Google's part than Microsoft's part. I wish they had taken the
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:16.280]   high road and continued to support it. But then I've also been an Outlook user on Windows.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.680]   When I shifted over to Outlook on the Mac, it's like nothing works over there. Can't
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:25.000]   start with Google, can't stinks. You can sync your email, but you want your calendar to talk,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.200]   you want your calendar on your Mac to talk to your iCloud calendar, forget it. You want your
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:35.880]   calendar to talk to Google, forget it. And whether it's Apple or Microsoft or Google or none of them
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.360]   all talking, it's just been a mess. It seems like there's no technical reason, obviously,
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.960]   why they couldn't continue to support it. And certainly it can't be a cost reason. But perhaps
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:50.200]   could you say the reason is they didn't want to support a proprietary protocol and prefer to support
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:56.040]   open protocols like CalDAV and CardDAV. These are open protocols. Didn't they clean a whole bunch
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:02.760]   of stuff out of... They're saying we're not going to support a protocol by one company for one company.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:09.720]   Why doesn't Microsoft use iMac, CalDAV and CardDAV? Right, right. But unless you pay us.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.440]   Right. I mean, there's a little weird. Yeah, they're still supporting it. It'd be one thing
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:22.280]   if they were like, well, you know... But if you pass... It's a little weird.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:28.680]   And somebody's telling me existing devices will work. Only new devices won't work.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.960]   Yeah, that wording was interesting. So yeah, it said for new devices. So if I've got exchange
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.200]   sync set up on my device, then it's going to on a free account, then it's going to continue to work.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:44.760]   So checking the device ID, I guess. Yeah, right. It's a hissy fit. It convinced me.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:51.480]   It's them going up yours, Microsoft. But it's their payback for Scrugal.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.840]   To the fact that... Well, they've got... And not just Scrugal, but now it's getting worse and
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:01.320]   worse with some other stuff on here. You have... They hired... Oh, what's his name?
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:12.920]   From somebody? A hired gun to go after... Microsoft hired a political operative to go after Google.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.440]   Oh, yeah. The Mark Penn. Thank you. Mark Penn.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.920]   Yeah. Wasn't that interesting? Mark Penn's the guy who did all that research for Clinton.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:26.680]   Right. The New York Times today has a very strange thing to me. It's an op-ed that is clearly
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.800]   placed by Microsoft. That's the disclosure at the end, which is just its PR move against Google.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:38.280]   And it's an op-ed with major play. So Microsoft's on a major... So now Apple is
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.000]   seeming to calm down. And now Microsoft is deciding that it's going to get louder
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.240]   in its long standing, near the end of the fight against Scrugal.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:58.200]   I mean, Mark Penn was the negative ad pollster for Bill Clinton. And so when you hire that guy,
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.280]   he was at Burstyn Marcell, or the PR firm. When you hire that guy to go after Google, you're...
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:06.840]   You know what you're going to get? You know it. I can't wait. Scrugal is just begun.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:13.960]   Get ready for more. Won't be coming from the FTC, though. They say Google did not.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:21.320]   Violate, Annie. They haven't said it out loud yet, but the reports are that they don't have a case
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:26.120]   against Google. They're trying to say in somewhat in sync with the EU. The EU is still pushing it.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.040]   But basically it's what I've been saying all along. There's not a good anti-trust case here.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.600]   And I think that they just legally don't have it. And that's what's happening.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.720]   They would love to file a case, but they just don't... They can't.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.200]   We're sure there's a trust in there somewhere.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.520]   Big, so they must be bad and evil.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.320]   Exactly the way the search bias claims.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.840]   But the EU could still go on.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.760]   EU is trying, but it's having similar problems. And the DOJ is investigating too. The Department
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:03.080]   of Justice, the US Department of Justice. But I don't think they're going to... We'll see.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:03.960]   I don't think they're going to get anywhere.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:15.480]   Do you see the FTC just announced its new COPPA a few minutes ago, its new COPPA privacy.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.280]   The Child Online Protection and Privacy Act.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.720]   Are they the enforcers thereof? They are. They are. So as we've talked about the show before,
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.480]   there's nothing really terribly new there versus what we've had. But now the things
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.400]   that we're in discussion and in hearings and such are formally announced,
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.160]   and they're much tougher, they're going to have a big impact on some sites.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:42.680]   So they're going to cover apps with COPPA, but they are accepting Apple's App Store and Google Play
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:48.520]   because they're not apps, they're platforms. Both Apple and Google lobbied the FTC hard, saying,
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:55.400]   "We can't be held responsible for what these apps do." So all these kids games are going to say,
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.720]   "Hey kids, you, like tapping this button, you agree that you've told your parents about all your
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:04.920]   information that we're sucking in and kids are tapping. Yes, and I just want to play."
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.000]   Nope, Gina, that won't be the way it works. In fact, what has to happen is
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:16.440]   the parent has to give explicit permission for the app to do these things. And the permission used to
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.360]   be able to come from email, that's no more. The parent has to do one of a few things. Last I
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:29.320]   knew in the draft, one was print out sign and scan a document. Hey kids, print this out.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:36.440]   A document or have a video conference with the company. Wow, that's a little. Wait, wait, wait,
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:43.480]   wait. So a kid's game in the App Store, say the Play Store. If it wants to use any person
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.440]   identifiable information, which is to say, for example, as far as I know it,
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.560]   "Gee, this is a geography game, kids. Where do you live and we'll tell you how big Texas is over
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:59.160]   your house?" Or if it's, I would imagine if it wants to hold your winning accounts under some
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:05.160]   thing like your name or just to get your email address to send you something. Any of those
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.320]   things where it's PII, person identifiable information, then the parent must give explicit
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.720]   permission in those ways I just don't want. Well, the senate...
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.800]   Is the device ID, I'm sorry Leo, is the device ID considered PII?
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:22.680]   US, in the EU there was talking about an IP address being considered personally identifiable
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:31.240]   information, which is insane. But yeah. There's a, the Center for Digital Democracy has written a
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:37.720]   letter to the FTC saying, "Hey, you got to investigate this SpongeBob Diner Dash game. This is from
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:45.080]   Nickelodeon. It's a freemium app, so it's free on the iPhone and iPad. It's in the kids game
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.560]   section. It's got SpongeBob. You know, if you have kids, SpongeBob SquarePants is very, very,
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:55.720]   very popular. The idea is for children to help SpongeBob seat, serve, and satisfy all kinds of
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:03.400]   fishy customers in five colorful bikini bottom restaurants run by the selfish Mr. Krab. It asks,
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:10.760]   "Can kids have to buy virtual coins to buy shoes that make SpongeBob faster or frying pan that
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:16.520]   makes the cook faster?" But the kids are asked for all sorts of stuff, including full name, email
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:21.160]   address, another contact information without providing notice to parents or obtaining prior
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:28.360]   parental consent. They're going to get zapped bad. Yeah. And it's Nickelodeon. The filing asks
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   the FTC to investigate the apps, data collection, and privacy notice practices, including its use
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:38.280]   of mobile marketing techniques such as UDIDs and device tokens to your question, Gina,
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:44.120]   which enable companies to send custom messages to individual children in the form of push notifications.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:49.880]   So yeah, under COPPA, those are considered personal information.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:55.320]   This according to the Center for Digital Democracy.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:53:00.360]   There are other clauses that relate specifically to targeting children and advertising.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.880]   If you know what's a child, blah, blah, blah, blah. But yeah.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.320]   Well, and obviously no adults playing SpongeBob, SquarePants, pants,
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:12.200]   tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny. It's a fun game. I play the grown up version of Diner Dash.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:19.800]   There's another version just for you grownups. We'll see what happens. Google, did they pay
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:25.240]   a Belgian? No, then pay. Okay. What happened?
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.600]   Did they? So the deer of the French Belgian papers have for some time been trying to go
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.200]   after Google News and they pulled out of Google News and they went back and then there's all
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:40.120]   kinds of back and forth. And now there's an agreed upon not a settlement, I wouldn't call it, but a
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:47.080]   resolution resolution. And as I understand it, Google, there's no explicit mention of Google
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:51.320]   paying royalties for the privilege of quoting and linking to their news stories. Google says
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:59.160]   we are collaborating with them to make money. Google is going to take out ads for its own Google
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:06.600]   services in those publications. Link, link. And yeah, we used to do that in cable television.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:12.280]   You'd go when you want to get to tech TV on a cable operator. Let's say you want to get on in
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:16.840]   beautiful New York City. So you go to cable vision and you have this little black bag that has money
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:23.880]   in it. And you say, we would like to give you some marketing co-op dollars, which means
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:30.440]   some money. This will help you market our new channel. Here's a million dollars, do whatever
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:36.280]   you want. But that's the same deal. We're going to buy ads in Le Monde. So Google is going to buy
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.880]   ads and well, that's from France. It's going to buy ads and publications. It's going to put
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:47.400]   ads on these publications and help them make money, which is fine. They always could do that.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:52.440]   Two to three percent of sales around five million euros, according to Le Monde.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:58.040]   And this goes right to the, shall we say it? Shall we cue it? The Leistung Schutzrecht.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:12.440]   Oh man. So what is the deal? Why is it? Why is this the same? What is like, say again,
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:19.160]   just remind us what Leistung Schutzrecht is. Schutzrecht is at ancillary copyright that would demand
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:25.320]   Google to pay straight out, basically a fee for the privilege of quoting headlines and snippets
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:31.160]   and linking to news articles. Google's doerfuse to do that because imagine what would happen.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:35.240]   Imagine the precedent set. If suddenly everyone on earth said, you can't link to me and give me,
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:43.880]   by the way, great benefit and value. If you don't pay me a b the impact on in this country fair use is
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:51.000]   devastating. The Leistung Schutzrecht.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.280]   That's what Leistung Schutzrecht. It doesn't speak with them. I wasn't listening to anything
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:05.720]   you said, Jeff. I was busy finding this YouTube video. Look, I do feel I just blathered it over time.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   Just in between reggae hits. Is it 420? So it is a way, yeah, it's 420. Go ahead.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:21.400]   Not on the west coast. Not on the west coast yet. But buying ads is giving them money.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.520]   We're going to buy some ads for me. So that's giving them money.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:31.560]   They got broad into it. Google's done this before. Google's done this mainly with the wire services
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:37.320]   where they have had disputes with the AP or AAP and then they've gone back and forth and then
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:43.000]   in the end they've said, "We're not going to license things. We all agree about that. Although we are
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.760]   going to do an agreement to work on things that would go beyond fair use and will help us better.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:53.160]   Like with the AP, they're like, "Help us better understand when we have duplicate content and blah,
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:57.320]   blah, blah, blah." And in the end, it actually just might as well have been a license.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:04.520]   Google actually did license AP content, Danny. But not for the reasons that AP was upset about.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:11.800]   Google specifically said, "We are licensing content to go beyond the stuff that is fair use."
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.200]   They were really, really careful to say, "We're not licensing AP because of there was some fair
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:20.920]   use violation." But we want to do things that go beyond fair use. Therefore, okay, what kind of deal?
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.240]   And that shut AP up. AP has been quiet for very long.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:29.000]   Is it hurt the newspapers? Because a lot of those links that would go to AP stories used to go to
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.760]   random newspaper sites where the AP story was run and now instead they go to AP stories on Google.com.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:40.040]   So the AP hurt its own members, but that's the way it works. This is getting off the inside baseball
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.200]   for most of the world. But I'm having dinner at the executive's from Zhejiang's Front Press.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.120]   So I'll abuse them about this.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:53.480]   Google could have played the... They have a strong hand. They could have just said, "Yeah, fine.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.720]   That's what they've done in the past." You don't want to...
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:01.240]   Well, Google's still... I mean, the Belgian case was still, if I remember correctly,
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:09.720]   going to an appellate court. Google had won some things here, but not one, some other things there.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:15.880]   So it was still being appealed. This is a cheap way to get the whole thing settled and shut it up.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:20.440]   At the same time when you're actually looking, as Jeff says, at a far bigger issue, which is,
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:26.520]   "Wow, people in France and Germany seem to want to be doing what people in the US were doing
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:31.320]   two years ago and then finally gave up on." It's like kind of watching a time warp going on.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   Yeah. The French and German newspapers seem to think that, "Oh, well,
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:40.040]   I guess you can just pay us some money now." Because the US papers, especially being led by the
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:45.960]   Wall Street Journal or the News Corp, kind of gave up on that as their ad prospects started coming
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.480]   back up. And they were like, "Oh, yeah, those pages use those are important to us. Actually,
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.720]   we're still making quite a bit of money off of that. So that's fine. Let's leave that stuff running."
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.960]   I didn't mention this, but this might have something to do with the screw-gling of
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:11.000]   Microsofts and the exchange server. Pamela Jones-Harber, who is a, according to the New York Times,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.440]   former member of the FTC, now a lawyer at Fulbright and Jowarski, where she represents
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:25.960]   Microsoft, wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times on the 18th, which was yesterday,
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.320]   slamming Google. And it was just a straight-out PR shot.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:38.280]   Wow. It was great as to be. And I found it really odd that the New York Times would give it this
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:45.400]   kind of play. And it has the disclosure at the end that she works for Microsoft, but all it is
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:51.480]   is the company line against Google. She says that settling with the FTC would be a severe setback
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:57.080]   for internet users. It'll allow Google to continue to mass unbridled control over data gathering
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.200]   with grave consequences for privacy, for consumer choice.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.840]   Except that the FTC isn't investigating anything about that in terms of antitrust.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:10.360]   The FTC's investigation is whether or not Google has been anti-competitive in some very specific
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.320]   areas. None of those have been related to consumer protection or gathering too much data.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:22.120]   So yeah, this feels very much like a, gosh, the FTC is about to settle with Google and not in the
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:28.120]   way that Microsoft and Microsoft's group of people that have decided that Google's been
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.080]   anti-competitive to them in search want. So what else can we do to slow it down? And they seem to
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.560]   be successful because there were a lot of accounts that we were going to get an FTC ruling
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.680]   this week. And now it looks like we're not going to have that until after the new year. So they
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.160]   may have stalled the FTC saying, find your good Google and we'll probably have a bit more debate
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.320]   on that. She writes when she was at the FTC, she dissented on the
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.520]   Commission's approval of the Google's acquisition of DoubleClick because she was concerned that
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:02.200]   combining the two companies would allow Google, markedly unchecked by competition to develop
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.720]   invasive profiles of individuals in Internet habits. But doesn't, I mean, I think there's a risky
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.000]   strategy for Microsoft to pursue because I'm sure they're doing the same thing.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.920]   Well, that's the thing about both. Go ahead, Dan.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.840]   That's the thing is like I was concerned that Google's combining those things,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.960]   I was concerned that the two companies combining unchecked by competition would let them
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.880]   have invasive profiles of Internet habits. But if only another big company would be able to
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.360]   compile as an invasive database, that would protect consumers. They're not,
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   she's like, oh, by the way, shove in the word competition in there somewhere because I got to
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.160]   get back to the fact that we're really actually more upset that Google may be not being
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.880]   stalled on competitive fronts rather than being a consumer protection.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:51.960]   Yeah. Consumer protection and competition have nothing to do with one another.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:57.160]   No. But the other, this is where I think both Microsoft and Newscorp are similar because
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:02.280]   it would be going too far to say they've given up on advertising, but advertising is not the
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.920]   core of their business that it certainly is to Google on much of media.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:11.240]   And Newscorp is going after fees, Microsoft is going after fees and licensing,
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:15.160]   and neither has proven these days to be good at online digital advertising.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.920]   So they're going after the core of their competitors business.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.360]   Oh, and by the way, as an FTC commissioner, should we be concerned that the first thing you do after
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.760]   not being an FTC commissioner is to go off and represent people who they want to argue stuff
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.360]   in front of the FTC? Did you get that revolving door, Eddie?
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.680]   She writes, "I'm no longer an FTC commissioner, but a lawyer representing companies, including
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.080]   Microsoft." So that makes her a sterling. That are concerned about Google's power as a data
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.640]   collector. Yes, there's some irony in that. It wasn't long ago that Microsoft faced its own
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.800]   major antitrust lawsuit and had to change its anti-competitive practices. We're now clean and
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:59.320]   wholesome. I'm surprised. I guess though, the op-ed page has never been a place for
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.960]   opportunity. I had an episode happen recently. I wrote a blog post about the tax fight that Google
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:12.600]   and also Starbucks and Amazon are in in the UK where I said that taxes are a legal obligation,
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:18.520]   not a moral choice, and to make Google, and these other companies, try to choose to pay more,
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.320]   is ridiculous in all kinds of ways. So I wrote this blog post and then Google came to me and said,
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.160]   "Well, the Guardian is looking for somebody to write an op-ed on this topic. You want to
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.560]   write it?" I said, "Well, that's what I'd write." So they went back to the Guardian and never happened.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.720]   But that was so weird to me that here's a news hanfer, negotiating with a company saying,
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.120]   "Well, we haven't been very nice to you, so you can get somebody to write something that says
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:46.120]   what you want to say." Google has been a light. It's going to go the other way too. Give it a week,
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.760]   give it to a page. Very page will have an op-ed. Or page will be in there with like, "Hey, Google,
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:58.920]   we're just publishing a search engine and it's all good." In fact, as I remember, Larry Page did have
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.640]   an op-ed piece in The Times not so long ago. Some time ago, that's correct. Maybe this is the
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.920]   response to that. Maybe Microsoft came along and said, "Not sure." Yeah.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:13.480]   It's very charming. We got somebody who can write something. I think op-ed's page is notorious
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.800]   for being that way. I've never been. I've never been. Op-ed page pisses me off. Now,
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.720]   here's where the competition, where the rubber really hits the road.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.960]   Nowhere you're going. Microsoft has stolen the Santa Tracker.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:37.960]   Since 2004, the NORAD Santa Tracker was a Google NORAD deal.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.840]   No, not since 2004, since 2007.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.080]   2007? I'll get into them hacking this whole thing if you want.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:49.560]   Yeah. Yeah. Because now Google lost it, right? NORAD's doing a deal with Bing.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:56.120]   So Leo, it starts back in 1974. I remember doing this on the radio.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.920]   Exactly. You would get goose lips. You were probably telling me on the radio that Santa was
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:07.480]   coming to me. I would. And I get clips from NORAD that you would drop in. This is Lieutenant
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:14.120]   Commander G. William F. Buckley reporting from NORAD's command center near the North Pole.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.880]   It looks like the Jolly Old Elf has begun his rounds.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.360]   And then when you'd play that, it was cute. You'd play it all evening.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:25.080]   I got a good bet. He's coming. Yeah. And it was fun. And the kids would listen to the radio and
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:30.280]   they go, "Look, it's on the radio. It must be true. It's a kind of uniform." And then it got
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.000]   really in the internet era. It wasn't as good, frankly. It changed.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.080]   No, it's better. Well, I mean, so, you know, NORAD, they're the missile tracking people, right?
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:46.840]   In 1955, there was an ad that was printed for Sears Roadbox saying, "Call to find out where Santa is."
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.440]   And they printed the wrong phone number. And people started calling the NORAD.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.200]   Oh, you're kidding. That's how it started?
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.480]   Not started. And so, NORAD said, "All right. Yeah, let me just check our radar. Here he is."
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.160]   And that's how the tradition got started, that they were tracking Santa.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.920]   So, as you said, you know, I'm asking why. It used to be on the radio. Yeah.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:10.680]   Time around 2004, they seemed to be getting onto the web and they started doing this stuff.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.400]   And here's what it looks like. I got a little clip from YouTube of NORAD tracking
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.600]   Santa, North American Air Defense Command. And this is what's great about it, by the way,
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:27.640]   because you've got 3D animations. Notice the big Google logo in the lower right hand corner.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:34.680]   I mean, it got it got sheathed up. I don't know. Are kids more persuaded now?
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.560]   They love it. The only thing I really hated is as a parent,
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.960]   I wanted to time shift it because you really want the kids to go to bed at like 9.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.320]   So, it doesn't help that Santa is in the middle of the country. I want to say, "Look, he's coming
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:58.680]   around now." Google said in their blog, so since 2007, Google has formally partnered with NORAD,
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.960]   where it has been Google Maps, Google YouTube, all sorts of things. And in fact, there were
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:11.880]   other Santa trackers. And I track this every year. I do. Every year, Christmas Eve, it's like,
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:16.520]   I'm going to disappear. I got to hear what's going on with the Santa tracking. Here's the rundown,
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.800]   because it used to be more complicated. You used to have all sorts of different things you could do
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:24.040]   in addition to NORAD. Now, I just run through and say, "Well, here's how NORAD's working today,
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.600]   and here's where the videos are, and here's how you can get it on your phone," and so on and so on.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:33.480]   And all these other Santa trackers have disappeared. NORAD has just been this jug or not that's been
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.880]   out there. And Google's been... So, monopoly. I want the FTC to investigate NORAD.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   Well, maybe because so they really have been this thing with Google. And then what happened was
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.520]   normally December 1st, like, clockwork, I'm sitting around waiting for Google to do their blog post
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:53.800]   about, "Hey, it's Christmas time again and holiday time, and we're working with NORAD. It never came."
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:59.560]   And then it was, I think, last week that Microsoft posted, they were working with NORAD.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:05.240]   Google's gone. Google's out of it. And we don't have the details. I got a statement from NORAD.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.440]   This was all I wrote it up on Search in July, but I got a statement from NORAD, and they're saying,
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.840]   "Yes, we've gone our different ways this year, and we're working with Microsoft now, and there's no
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:18.040]   statement about who's paying what or whatever, but someone's paying something, right?" And Google was
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:23.480]   out. Okay, so you're kind of like, "Ah, a little bit Microsoft." Look at this, though, Danny. So,
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.520]   you go to noradsanada.org, where they have the countdown to track Santa, but you look down here
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:35.480]   in the bottom. Download the official NORAD track Santa Windows 8 app. Now, you have a Google and
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:43.480]   iPhone app. They bought Santa Claus. I think Microsoft said, "They bought Santa." If you... They did buy Santa,
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.800]   or they bought Santa for more money than Google was paying for it. Apparently, you can also get
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:55.080]   NORAD official, "I tracked Santa gear." Yes, you can't. It's got... This has really gotten commercial.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:59.560]   What? The Danny has followed this story. Goodness, Danny. He's a historian.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:04.360]   Yeah. Please. Notice right below that NORAD tracking Santa, there's one thing that you're
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.080]   going to still see there, which is YouTube, and I'll come back to that. So, Google's out.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:15.560]   Ha ha! Windows wins. Great. Isn't that funny? Buh-buh-buh, or isn't it sad? Because in some ways,
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.400]   Google got really into this whole NORAD thing. So, today, Google announces that,
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:26.280]   "Oh, yes. It's 2004. We've been tracking Santa." Here, let me turn this down. It's overpowering.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:31.960]   It's the NORAD track Santa video. Sorry. Go ahead. And so, they say, "We've been tracking
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:37.400]   Santa since 2004, and here we are doing it once again at our new Google tracking center."
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.200]   There's no mention in NORAD. So, really, Google is now taking on the missile defense people.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:51.400]   It's gotten that big. You think you track missiles? We track all the world's information. We can go
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:56.360]   toe to toe with you. And that's exactly what's happening. So, they created their own Santa Tracker
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:02.280]   page. Now, this is still NORAD's Santa Tracker. This is their promotional video for 2012.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.560]   Key difference that will be between these two things. Google was not going to produce its own
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.800]   video of Santa flying around. It's only going to show you where they're running around on maps.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.040]   Here's the official Windows 8 app, by the way.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.920]   Probably not going to produce its own video because the one thing that NORAD is continuing to do
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.440]   is to post all that video over to Google-owned YouTube.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.960]   See, we can't have Christmas harmony. It's on YouTube.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.920]   Google's double dipping.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:36.200]   For now, the thing is next year, maybe Google will decide they want to do their own videos as well.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:42.040]   And I, anyway, for those of us, me who tracks and are tracking tracking,
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.440]   it's gotten vicious.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.800]   Recursive tracking.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.320]   How old are your kids now, Danny?
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.640]   No, they're 11 and 13. So, it's...
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.320]   Is it now moot?
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.040]   Hey, if anybody's watching this, go away.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.480]   Believers in the household.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.840]   Of course. You know what I always say? Those who don't believe in Santa don't get presents from Santa.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.440]   Very good point.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.480]   Yes. Here's the Google Santa tracker, which is frankly a little more HTML5 than the NORAD
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:17.480]   and there's more stuff to do. There's little bouncy activities.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.800]   I'm waiting to see the drones come in after Santa.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.760]   No.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.040]   Santa.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.320]   Massage and no, Santa. I gotta say, though, I kind of wish--
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.720]   Wait a minute. They have a Google+ link to Santa.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.760]   They do.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.920]   Santa is clearly on Google+.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.640]   Oh, gosh.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.200]   You can add an X to 7 to your wish list for Santa.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.400]   Oh, I bet you can.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.440]   Aww.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.880]   I'm sad saying that you like Santa.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.000]   I'm gonna like Santa right now.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.640]   I'm clearly the Grinch in the room.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.760]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.720]   Edda says, "Mommy, mommy, mommy, we can track Santa. Here he comes."
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.280]   You're gonna videotape it and put it up online.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.640]   I'm gonna crush all the Santa drinks when they get go.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.040]   Really?
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.000]   What? What a Grinch.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.000]   I know. I'm a Grinch.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.320]   You are gonna get so much spam now.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.640]   I know. I know. I read this great post.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.040]   I think it was Charlie Park that this post about how he wanted to be honest with his kids about Santa.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:19.160]   But he also wanted them to enjoy the story of it and the character of it.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.240]   So he said that he tells us kids that Santa is a game that people play.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.320]   And that you pretend that Santa's real.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.520]   Like the rules of the game is you pretend that Santa's real and you never break character.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.040]   But this is kind of a--
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.360]   Have you told your mother you're gonna do this yet?
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:32.760]   No.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.040]   We have not broken his new--
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.160]   She's not gonna do this.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:35.640]   Look at this.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.680]   Get ready.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.560]   You can chat with--
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.000]   Welcome. Every holiday season.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.360]   Wait a minute. I gotta do this to Santa voice.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.320]   I have to do this.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.640]   Make sure you sign the legal agreement before you do it.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.960]   Every holiday season I make personal phone calls to North American phone numbers
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:54.440]   between the hours of 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. and send personal messages on Google+ and email 24 hours a day.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.080]   Let's first--
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.520]   Let's check the proper refers.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.400]   First, what is your birthday?
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.760]   What is your birthday only?
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.760]   Big kids can send messages.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.200]   This is my only--
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.400]   I'm not just telling you--
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.200]   I'm telling you--
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.160]   This is my only--
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.200]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.800]   Let me make myself a little kid.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.840]   I'll say I was born in 2002.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:11.800]   I'm 10.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.000]   Tough cookie and screwed.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   Sorry, little elf.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.240]   Only grown-ups can send messages.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.440]   Oh, that's--
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.960]   Hey, Santa!
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.680]   What the hell?
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.240]   Go click on the first day again.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.400]   You're on my nasty list.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:29.720]   Can I--
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.680]   Can I get back?
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:31.800]   Refresh.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.280]   In the chat, I get mail it, you go back.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.320]   No, I don't think so.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.200]   It says you're done.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.720]   I have to--
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.360]   I have to re--
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:38.840]   I have to re--
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.120]   So much for honesty.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:40.840]   Reboot.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:41.800]   I'm going to--
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.440]   I'm going to--
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.800]   Yeah, so this really works right.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.320]   Instead of giving them my--
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.920]   So most kids are smart enough to go, oh, okay.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.480]   Let me say my birthday was 1129 1903.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   That'll work.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.640]   The current said that you can lie about your birthday.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.480]   Read over our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.960]   Even Santa has a legal team.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:05.800]   Yes.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.960]   This is why I'm not telling you how to about this.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   This is horrible.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.320]   This is terrible.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.440]   What is your name?
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.040]   Leo.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.360]   I'm not sure how to say your name.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.680]   How should I refer to you in the message?
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.880]   Skip saying my name.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.640]   Oh, call me bro.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.040]   Can I say Leo?
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.240]   Look at the choices, bro.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.000]   Bro, brother from another mother.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.760]   Cheerleader.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.720]   No, no.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.720]   Dude, dude, that geek hacker,
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.000]   cartbreaker, hipster.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.440]   Hello, hipster.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:36.840]   Hello.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.400]   Hottie.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.360]   Hello, Hottie.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:38.920]   Hottie.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.560]   I'm going to be--
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.280]   Are you a guy or a gal?
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.800]   Little late to ask that, Santa.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.640]   What are you wearing right now?
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.320]   Oh, hey, Santa's a creeper.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.200]   Who should we send the message to?
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.240]   What is their name?
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:51.720]   Wait, is this a whole really?
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.600]   You think I'm faking this?
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.080]   Hottie.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.800]   I'm not sure how to say their name.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.040]   How should I refer to them in the message?
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.480]   Um, cutie pants.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.920]   Send.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:08.200]   Are they a guy or a gal?
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:08.920]   They're a guy.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.760]   What is your relationship to Leo?
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.640]   You are there.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.080]   Bestie.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.200]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.120]   Zero people are going through this.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.000]   Zero.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.760]   What does Leo do for a living?
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.960]   Oh, my God.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:26.920]   I'm an athlete.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.520]   Where does Leo live?
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.520]   This is so highly illegal.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.560]   No, I guess because I said I was over a vage.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.520]   No, because now I'm giving information about somebody else.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.160]   What would he like for a gift, a beach body?
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.520]   This is--
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.320]   What the hell?
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.160]   This is filthy.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.240]   We're almost done.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.560]   Just a few more questions to go.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.240]   What kind of underwear do you--
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.800]   What fun nickname should I call Leo?
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.040]   Sister from another mister.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.800]   Sure, why not?
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.760]   Jesus.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.680]   Would Leo be celebrating this?
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.280]   What will Leo be celebrating?
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.200]   No, fast of us on here.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.160]   I'm a very disappointed.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.960]   I'm going to be celebrating staying warm.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:15.160]   The holidays, the new year, the season, winter, Christmas,
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.440]   Hanukkah or Kwanzaa.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.440]   I'm going to celebrate--
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.360]   Oh, Santa Claus is going to call you for Hanukkah.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.120]   Hello, happy Hanukkah.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.040]   What type of food?
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.000]   This is--
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:25.960]   What is this?
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.840]   Fablek anush.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.880]   You can say that, not Leo.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.440]   What do you think I enjoyed during my free time catching up on the soaps?
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.120]   Cleaning the garage,
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.200]   Gassing up the sleigh,
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.800]   Gassing up Mrs. Claus,
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.960]   Getting some me time.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.320]   Holy cow.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:45.960]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.200]   Now there's a message for me.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.240]   Yeah, click on it.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.200]   You get the here play.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.800]   Oh, you knew this, Danny.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.080]   I did, it's crazy.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.760]   Oh, hello, cutie pants.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.920]   This is Santa Claus.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.760]   I just spoke with your bestie, Hadi.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.960]   He told me,
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.920]   You have been a very good athlete.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.040]   And this year you would like a beach body.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.680]   Well, my first stop is your house in La La Land.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.280]   So don't forget to leave me some Baba Ganush.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.480]   And be sure to go to bed early so I can bring you us.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.440]   Surprise, but no peeking.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.200]   All right, sister from another mister.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.320]   Santa has to go pack up the sleigh with presents
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.080]   and get in some me time.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.240]   Later, alligator.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.600]   Google, this is the War on Christmas.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.560]   Hello, fucking you.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.040]   Wow, peto Santa.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.320]   Okay, well, that was like mad libs.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.040]   I'm going to now, can I share that on Google plus?
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.000]   You bet I can.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.280]   Wow, Santa's a perv.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.280]   That is just wild.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.400]   Whose 20% time was this?
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.160]   Jeez.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.000]   Can I save it?
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.680]   Copy, copy link.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.800]   I don't know if I can save it.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.120]   No, you can't save it.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.480]   They don't want anybody to hear it.
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.120]   So you can do NORAD where Lieutenant Commander G Clay Whistle
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.400]   will tell you that Santa is now over Japan.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.600]   Or you can have Santa hit on you.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:36.840]   Wow, this is the battle.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.960]   Santa culture is weird.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.320]   The battle for Christmas.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.000]   So didn't, now come on, didn't you do Santa when you were a kid?
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.120]   Totally, absolutely.
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.440]   Did Santa, but I was the youngest by far of four.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.080]   So my believing, like everyone's good Christmas sort of hinged on my believing.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.320]   So the point at which I started to get a little skeptical and be like,
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.640]   I don't really get, I mean, reindeer's flying and there are billions of houses
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.160]   and we don't have a chimney.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.000]   You know, my whole family was like, no, no, this is, you know, don't ruin Christmas.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:03.720]   Santa's real.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.680]   And it, you know, it's like, it was bad.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.760]   I felt I was like, I'm being actively lied to for everyone else's entertainment.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.600]   Wow, you just, you just have to.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.360]   I'm a Santa baggage.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.480]   Wow, a lot of baggage.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.720]   Santa, how about your wife?
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.000]   How does she feel about this?
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.600]   She's like presents.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.320]   She's cookies and presents, not religious at all.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.000]   No, no, Santa though.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:29.560]   He's in presence.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.080]   Santa as far as Santa involves presents.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:36.360]   Which is fair.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.400]   Yeah, that's fair.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.040]   I'm telling you, your mother's going to watch this and you are going to get in such big trouble.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.040]   I'm really in trouble because my brother watches this.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.440]   So, uh, it's going to get back to my-
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:47.720]   I watch your report back.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.360]   Wow.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.400]   You're already getting Santa.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.760]   We're already getting bets now.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.640]   We're already getting the Santa outfits for the baby.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.160]   Oh boy.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.000]   She's like getting them in the mail.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:57.880]   Like, as guests from my mom-
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.520]   Santa's wonderful.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.040]   You're like the story of Santa.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:06.200]   I'm not, I'm just not such a big fan of the like, of the lying to your kids.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:06.760]   What kind of thing?
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.120]   Lying to your kids.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:11.560]   I, I, we're so going to get so much email about this, by the way.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.560]   I'm getting, is it just such a big trouble?
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.960]   Google, Melissa Santa, but you kill him.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.240]   Hey, mister from another sister.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.720]   Um, wow.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.920]   You don't believe in me.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.440]   You believe in this?
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.000]   You believe in Google?
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.960]   I got a present for you right here.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.720]   Little Gina, come sit in my lap.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:41.240]   I, I shouldn't, lying is a very strong word and I absolutely don't judge anyone else who-
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.480]   uh, leaves in Santa or teaches their kids about Santa.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.920]   It's just not, it won't feel right.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.560]   It'll be about something.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.680]   You know, whatever you want, she's your child.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.760]   You can screw up in any way you choose.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.600]   That's the beauty of parenthood.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.160]   That's true.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:53.640]   That's true.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.480]   And I'm sure then three years I will have given in.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.560]   She'll be like, mommy, mommy, I want to believe in Santa.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.600]   I'll be like, all right.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.880]   That's, that's what you want.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.360]   Let's do it.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.880]   She's gonna be that little weird kid in Montessori's telling all the other kids, you know.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.040]   No, that's the rule.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:08.280]   One of the rules of the game is that you don't break-
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.000]   Ah, good.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   But pen that guy, he's real.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:11.320]   Good.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.160]   Because you don't want your kid to be the one telling the other kids.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.320]   That uh, he's not real.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.760]   Is Santa an algorithm?
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:27.000]   Uh, take a break.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.080]   And then we're going to come back with our tip tool and tip and tool and number.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.040]   I mean, there was one thing.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.800]   Number tip and tool of the week.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.080]   But first of all, from Ford,
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.920]   this is also a commercial.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:44.040]   Using my likeness and the likeness of my new vehicle.
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.760]   I've, I've already ordered my Ford Fusion.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.440]   I got the, I'm, I'm waiting for the plug-in hybrid, which comes out next month.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:50.920]   Oh.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.120]   I'm really excited.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.840]   So I have a must.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.240]   I have kind of, I have an eight, V8.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.960]   It's a little bit of, it likes gas.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.640]   It's a lot.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.800]   And it's really fun to drive and it's kind of a muscle car.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.800]   So I thought, okay, I've been driving that for a few years.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.600]   Time to drive something a little more economical makeup for it.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.480]   Are you going to trade it in?
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.480]   No, Lisa is getting it.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:16.520]   And she has a lead foot.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.640]   So it's really not.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.600]   It's a net loss.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.920]   But I'm excited.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:26.520]   What I want is the 2013 Ford Fusion energy, which is their plug-in hybrid.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.160]   Cause, and also it is loaded with technology.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:34.200]   This is, see, one of the reasons Ford advertises on Twitch is because they know you guys are geek
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.280]   fanatics, you're gadget fanatics, and you're just going to flip over what the stuff,
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.840]   this car, like the Bliss with the cross traffic alert.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   This is the blind spot information system.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.480]   What it does, you have two radar.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:50.040]   This is talking about autonomous vehicles, radar detectors in the left and right rear bumper
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.480]   that detect traffic in the side lanes that you can't see.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.760]   It's a blind spot.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:58.040]   It lights up a little thing on your mirror there and does a little audio tone.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.040]   Say there's somebody in your blind spot.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.400]   Don't change lanes.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.360]   It's useful also when you're pulling out of a parking space.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.120]   You can't see around.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.320]   It lets you know there's oncoming traffic, the cross traffic alert.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.920]   I just love this kind of stuff.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.720]   It also has the active parkuses.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.480]   Now this is an autonomous vehicle thing.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.440]   Watch this.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.320]   This is so cool.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.360]   So you say, I want to park.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.800]   You're driving around in Brooklyn.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.880]   And it looks at spaces till it can see one that you fit into.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.280]   And then it goes, okay, got it.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.640]   Pull forward.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.120]   And then you pull forward and then you take your hands off the wheel,
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.280]   your foot off the accelerator, keep your foot on the brake.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.560]   This was my mistake.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560]   Keep your foot on the brake and you let it go.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:41.880]   And it does this very smoothly and beautifully in less than 24 seconds.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.960]   It without touching the wheel, it perfectly parallel parks.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.400]   That freaks me out.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.840]   That's an autonomous vehicle.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.480]   Now the reason you keep your foot on the brake is because you're still an idol.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.800]   And so once this, I did not know this.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.600]   I learned once you've parked, you turn off the key,
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.480]   you know, but you don't just sit there and go, wow.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.640]   Because the car will continue to roll into the car behind you,
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.840]   which is exactly what happened to me.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.840]   I was so blown away.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.480]   I was literally, in fact, I would suggest when you get your new car with the active park
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.960]   assist, your new Ford vehicle, that you do this in a parking lot somewhere or something,
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.000]   just a couple of times.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.960]   Because the wow factories, I mean, this is really what happened to me.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.040]   It was like, I can't believe what just happened.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.080]   The car drove itself.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.800]   It parked itself, which is amazing.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.120]   I can go on and on.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.880]   There is so much cool stuff built into these new Ford vehicles.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.760]   You could take a look at Ford.com/technology or drive one at a Ford dealer.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.280]   Just go to your Ford dealer.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.480]   Say I want it the 2013 Ford Tourist and the 2013 Ford Fusion,
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.480]   both have these technologies available.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.280]   Go further in your Ford.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:46.920]   I'm excited.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.880]   I can't wait.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.280]   I don't know when I'm going to get it, but I'm very excited.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.640]   Hillio?
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:56.600]   With a plug-in hybrid, does the gas engine ever turn the wheels,
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.200]   or does it always just recharge the electric and the electric always turns the wheels?
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.480]   So you only use the gas engine when it needs to, when you either exceed the range,
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.200]   I've heard, I don't know, it was about 35 miles.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.280]   Or you want to go faster, you don't want to go on the freeway, like 60.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.840]   You need enough power to go 60-2, I think, or something like that.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.640]   So it will directly power the transmission?
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.840]   So you drive around electric unless the gas is needed for power at a higher speed,
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.360]   or you run out of battery.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.880]   So the idea is, as I'm driving around, I don't drive more than 30 miles a day,
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.840]   ever, unless I go into town, but almost every nine times out of 10,
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.120]   I'm just driving to the studio or doing the groceries or doing some errands.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.320]   All of that will be on electric.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.120]   So in effect, you get pretty good mileage.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:42.760]   A little bit.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.880]   What you just showed there, though, that looks like an SUV.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.560]   That's the edge.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.360]   The edge does it.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.400]   I did it in the flex.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.920]   You know what's great?
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.920]   They're putting these technologies in almost all their cars.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.520]   So I'm going to get an infusion, but yeah, that was the, I think that was the edge,
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.120]   or was it the escape that they're doing that?
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:00.840]   And I can't tell.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.800]   Oh, probably.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.120]   Okay.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.240]   Looks like the edge.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.680]   The edge is very high tech.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.680]   A lot of these features.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.040]   And it was in the flex.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:10.840]   Which color should I choose?
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.160]   I'm trying to decide which color.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:13.720]   That's the height.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.840]   Santa Claus red.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.320]   Should I?
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.880]   I have a bright red Mustang right now.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.080]   And I take great pride in the fact that I have only been pulled over a few times.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.840]   And my bright red Mustang, I think Lisa will get more tickets than I.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.640]   Green is bad.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.240]   Now the green, I don't like.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.840]   What do you think, Chad?
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.360]   So, you know, if you think that's green, I thought it was a golden sort of color.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.400]   Yeah, but you don't like it.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:35.880]   It's hard to tell.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.480]   Maybe just the, the, the, as we're streaming and it's not quite so.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:40.360]   That could be.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:40.840]   Yes.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.960]   Red does look nice.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.560]   I also just didn't like it.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:44.120]   Black.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.160]   Black.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:45.480]   Let's see.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.440]   The fusion energy, though.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.640]   You're not looking at the right.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.640]   See, I don't know if they'll have this.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.480]   That's the full, that's the fusion hybrid.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:51.720]   Right.
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.280]   I went to college.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:52.840]   See, what I'm on is.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.120]   So, I need to go to fusion energy.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.280]   What I'm on is the energy plug-in hybrid.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.440]   That's the one I want.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.960]   I'm so excited.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.360]   Gallery.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:04.920]   And then I'm going to get the 240 volt outlet in my garage,
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.440]   because it'll charge in just a few hours.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.800]   And, and can you use this?
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:16.520]   Some people were using their Nissan leaves to power their houses in the sandy blackout.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.640]   Honest to God.
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.920]   That's interesting.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:19.720]   I mean, I could.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.440]   It's even worse at basically.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.320]   You could reverse it.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:21.960]   I don't know.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.400]   I'll have to ask Ford.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.360]   What a good idea.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.160]   What a good idea.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.080]   Anyway.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:33.080]   Ford.com/technology.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.600]   You know what you forgot, boss?
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.640]   What?
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.120]   Genevog.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.920]   It's time for the Play the Trumpets.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.080]   Change log.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.600]   Oh, change log.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:49.480]   There's a change right there.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.880]   And now Gina Trapani with what's new?
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.880]   Oh, my God.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.280]   As soon as we played the trumpets, she dropped off.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.880]   I don't know.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:58.440]   Did you hear me?
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:58.920]   OK?
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:27:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:27:59.960]   Go ahead.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.440]   OK.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.000]   Change log.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]   I heard you say change log and then you disappeared.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.400]   Wait, I'm using the wrong camera.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:05.640]   Sorry.
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:06.440]   I don't know what happened.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:06.840]   Skype.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.920]   Skype new.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.440]   By the way, Google, if you want to make a Skype replacement, hang out.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.000]   This is not it.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.720]   But if you want to make a Skype replacement that uses that technology,
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.120]   we'll use it because Skype is getting worse and worse.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.880]   I don't know what just happened.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.840]   It was perfect timing, though.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.720]   It was just during the bug part of the change log video.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.200]   I'll tell you why.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:26.840]   You're fixing that.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.840]   I'll play the video of me crashing the flex.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.120]   Somebody posted this on YouTube.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.560]   See, we had camera crew in there with me.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.520]   I'm looking for a place to park.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.200]   I'm going to stay pretty close here because apparently that's what I did wrong last time.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.400]   Searching, searching.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.240]   It's really kind of amazing.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:48.920]   Space found.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.560]   Pull forward.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.120]   Because this is a fairly big vehicle.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.760]   Maybe you shouldn't broadcast and drive the next time.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.480]   Move hands.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:55.960]   Well, no.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.120]   You know, I think...
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:58.200]   It's okay.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.720]   So, they're engineers sitting...
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.280]   I'm on the Ford test track.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:02.840]   Right.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.000]   And there's a fiesta behind me and there's guys sitting in it.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.960]   And I think they set me up because they said,
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.080]   "Oh, yeah, just go ahead."
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:14.680]   And I think they wanted me to crack because they were laughing.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.160]   I think this was...
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.120]   Anyway, watch this.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:18.760]   This is so cool.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:19.720]   I take my hands off the wheel.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.280]   Oh, no.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.000]   Oh, no.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.760]   That can't be possible.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.640]   And it's really kind of mind-boggling when it does.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:26.760]   There's other cars here.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.240]   The other...
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.120]   Actually, yesterday I...
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:29.080]   Look at that.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.360]   I'm not doing anything.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.240]   Ah, oh.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:31.640]   Wow.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.120]   It doesn't...
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.160]   Boom.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.640]   You re-read it yourself.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.200]   Wait a minute, watch.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.320]   You have to put the brake on.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.840]   [Laughter]
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:39.480]   I forgot to...
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.440]   I forgot to...
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.320]   Yeah, we...
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.960]   And they're laughing.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.680]   They're howling.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.720]   These two guys in the bed.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.400]   I thought I was going to do the whole thing on a mat.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.280]   You know, I'm on...
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.160]   It's very slow.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.360]   I'm not moving very fast.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:50.840]   It's just a...
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.320]   It's, you know, it's idle.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:53.720]   So I didn't...
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.160]   There was no damage to either vehicle,
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.320]   which is very relieved by the way,
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.880]   because I thought it never letting me on the test track again.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.440]   [Laughter]
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.160]   All right, we are...
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:03.720]   Are we fixed?
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:05.160]   Am I fixed?
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:05.960]   Change log.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.360]   Yes.
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:06.360]   Yes.
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:06.920]   Yes.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:07.880]   Awesome.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.440]   Change log.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.600]   Biggest Google launch this week was Google Maps for iPhone,
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.880]   which we didn't have to talk about.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.920]   Very much.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:15.800]   It's awesome.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.080]   We're saving it for the change log.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.360]   Yep.
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.120]   Traffic, chairman of my turn on navigation,
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.800]   transit directions, walking directions,
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.040]   satellite view, street view, indoor photos,
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.400]   zagit restaurant reviews.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:26.040]   It's awesome.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.440]   And I think we had another story in the rundown here
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.160]   that we didn't get to,
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.400]   which was like iOS 6 adoption,
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.280]   you know, shot up like...
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:32.840]   29%
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.800]   That's something.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.280]   People who had iPhones were holding off.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:36.840]   We're holding off now.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.360]   Because they didn't want to use the dangers...
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.800]   In fact, we have studio audience
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.440]   that are nodding.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.960]   They're going, "Yeah, we didn't want to upgrade."
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.040]   That's amazing.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.720]   That was a huge release.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:46.920]   Really, really happy about that.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.440]   Now, it's funny because Google did say,
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.400]   "Well, we're not going to put turn
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.240]   by turn into your map, Apple."
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.560]   So they did it when they released theirs.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:53.960]   They did.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:54.840]   Yep.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.360]   And there is a workaround.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.400]   Some people don't know this,
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.160]   but you know, when you say this series,
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.480]   take me to La La Land.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.560]   It will launch Apple Maps.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.240]   That was my tip.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.360]   Okay, we'll save that.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.600]   Because Gina's going to explain how you can get around that.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:09.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.480]   So Google Maps for iPhone.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.120]   Awesome.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:12.520]   Get it.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.040]   New YouTube Capture app for iPhone as well.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.360]   Basically, it's a free app.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.240]   It lets you record movies from the app
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.840]   or import them from your camera roll.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.920]   This is YouTube Capture for iOS.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:25.320]   Oh.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.160]   And you can do basic edits on your clips
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.360]   and upload them to YouTube,
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.440]   Google+, Facebook, or Twitter.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.600]   So it expands the options behind the single option
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.200]   that Apple offers to share.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:34.920]   It's neat.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:35.800]   YouTube Capture.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.720]   And it's weird if you search for YouTube Capture
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.000]   in the app store.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.280]   It's like the third result.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.920]   So just page over and find it.
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:47.400]   Google Music gets the scan and match feature in the US.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.200]   This feature was available in the UK for a while,
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.320]   but now it's coming to the US.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.560]   Basically, Google scans your local music library
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.760]   when you use Google Music.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:56.840]   It makes a song that matches instantly available
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:57.320]   in the cloud.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.080]   So no upload required.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.160]   And it features similar to iTunes match
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.360]   and it was only available in Europe,
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.920]   but it's coming to the US starting today, I believe.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:05.880]   And that was yesterday.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.280]   Of course, I've already uploaded all 39 gigabytes
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.480]   of my music, but that's all right.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:10.280]   Right.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.000]   Right.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:15.160]   Google Plus, new mobile apps for both iOS and Android
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.240]   had been released for the few new features.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:20.600]   On Android, Google's offering full size backups
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.840]   of your photos up to five gigabytes free.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.280]   In addition to the standard size option,
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.240]   that's unlimited free storage at 2048 pixels.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.240]   And to give it a try, you turn on instant upload
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.080]   and you start taking pictures and your photos
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.200]   that you shoot will be saved in a private album on Google Plus.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.320]   Photos, fears.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.200]   You have to opt into that genome on the photos.
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.320]   What's the default?
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.200]   Yeah, it's you have to turn on instant upload.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.720]   So I think you get prompted when you first
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.920]   install to turn on instant uploads.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.040]   Well, I already have it on.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.320]   So is it going to go to full size photo automatically or?
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:49.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.840]   Absolutely.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.040]   Yeah, it goes automatically.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.760]   Photos, fears also come to the mobile stream
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.200]   inside the Google Plus app.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:00.440]   So you'll need Android 4.2 to create the 360 degree panoramas
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.760]   jelly bean, which we talked about in an earlier show.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.840]   But any Froyo or later user can see them in the Google Plus stream.
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:10.120]   A couple other little features, low bandwidth, hangouts,
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.440]   work better, easier event messaging,
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.360]   and a better hangouts on air experience.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.480]   So basically just Google trying to get out there last Google Plus
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:18.280]   update to the year.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.640]   Blogger got some plus integration.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:25.240]   You can plus mention brands of people in your Blogger posts.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.280]   And that will alert those people, notify those people
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.080]   if you share your Blogger posts then on Google Plus.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.880]   So we see the the classification of Blogger starting to happen there.
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.840]   And finally, Google Play Books got a read aloud and a few other features.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.920]   Read, I actually haven't gotten a chance to try this because I found this
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.880]   while the show, I think it got released today.
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.240]   I found it during while the show was airing,
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:51.480]   but Life Hacker reports that the read aloud feature sounds really robotic,
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.360]   more than other voice command prompts, but it gets a job done.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.480]   So it's not as polished as maybe some other read aloud,
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.920]   pay for read aloud services, but it's free.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.320]   Did you mention the mood button in Google Plus?
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.720]   No, what's the mood button?
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.120]   Oh, maybe you iPhone users don't have that.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.920]   See, I could say I could select a mood.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:15.160]   Like, and post it on Google Plus.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.560]   Love, love, love to the early days of my space.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.520]   Yeah, yeah, this is this is this is so horrible.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.960]   But it doesn't matter because it's great.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.200]   And then let's see, I'm going to put I'm going to send this to all the tweets.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.120]   And then what it does is it makes it like little animated posting.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.880]   The end of the world.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.720]   This Tony just having a bad day.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.520]   Brian Burnett's not feeling well.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.120]   He's one of our TDS.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.160]   Apparently the the Twitch staff really took to this big time.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.960]   So you when you compose a post, there's an option for mood.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.120]   You can have a yeah, there's I don't think that's on the iPhone version.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.960]   Fact, you see they've they've changed it on this is the Google Plus.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.080]   They have these buttons now.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:07.240]   This really looks almost like Instagram photo check in mood, right?
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.320]   They really want to make it all in one.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.720]   This is an all in one app now on Android.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.880]   Yeah, this is not on iOS.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.960]   And in fact, I'm switching back to Android full time.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.280]   You better can give it your new gig.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.360]   You're game.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.600]   I've been using the iPhone and the next seven.
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.840]   So I never really switched away from Android.
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.920]   But I'm putting my app and truthfully taking pictures of the baby.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.760]   They come out a little better with the iPhone.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.360]   But I'm going to switch back to the galaxy and access full time.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.640]   So I've been I've been figuring out.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.920]   I got I you know, you got me to open it and I regret it.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.600]   But I'm liking the Nexus four.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.800]   I'm thinking I might.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.520]   Nexus four is a little all about Android.
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.640]   Yeah, you have to use an Android phone if you're going to host that show.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.240]   So here's my Google Plus.
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.840]   And it really is polluting the Google plus stream.
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.880]   That's ridiculous.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.960]   That is huge.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.240]   It's ginormous.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.880]   God.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.040]   Like more something.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.560]   What?
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.800]   It's like a giant thumb or something.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.160]   I don't I don't really get it.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.080]   You know what would have been better if they had little androids.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.400]   And we're like robots.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.160]   Everybody loves the Android robot.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.760]   But you know all of this it's it's like it's for the kids.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.720]   They're doing it for the kids.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.640]   So I don't know if you saw the the post some kind of go from a Googler.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.840]   You know those little stickers you have on the back of the car, mom, dad,
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.880]   son and daughter and the dog.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.320]   There's an Android version of that.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.040]   Oh, I like that.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:34.760]   I want that one.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.240]   That great.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:35.720]   I'll take that.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:36.200]   I'll take that.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.560]   A bomb and write a dad and write a boy and write a girl and read.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.560]   I have to admit that with the changes they're making with a new apps which are really nice
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.680]   even on the iPhone and the communities.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:50.840]   I am more and more thinking Google Plus is actually kind of the place to be.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.080]   Oh, no, I really like it.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:55.880]   I'm liking it.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.720]   Big news Leo Leo.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:00.280]   That's the first time you said something nice about Google News.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:00.920]   Google Plus.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.320]   Well, not the first time I liked it when it began.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:06.760]   But I but I just kind of know all my friends slowly dribbled away.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:07.800]   What's up?
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.320]   The communities have been great.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.160]   We have five thousand two hundred eight in this.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:14.840]   By the way, Gina, have you joined the twig community so I can make you a moderator?
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.040]   Yes, I have.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.080]   Okay.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:17.480]   I got to look.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.480]   I got to find this one problem now finding is going to be difficult.
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:20.520]   Leo, did you join?

[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.440]   And that's nice.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.840]   By the way, Gina, I the way the album, Mark, they works.

[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.440]   I apologize.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:41.000]   But if you but if you go full on it, I think you see the.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.200]   That's fine.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.160]   I know.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.040]   That's completely fine.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.160]   So join our community.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:48.040]   Yeah, you just you just it's a it's called twig.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.440]   Been there.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.720]   I added some links about that.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.720]   We got to them because we went on for so long about Santa Claus,
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.240]   but I added some links to the rundown.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.720]   Thanks to stuff I saw in in the community.
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.240]   Who knew that the biggest.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:37:59.960]   Oh, I think so.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.920]   Like I'm.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.240]   I gave mashups in there.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.600]   Who knew that the Santa story would be the big story of the week.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:11.800]   Anyway, that concludes the Google change.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.360]   Long.
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:18.360]   That's so lame.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.080]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:24.280]   I hope you negotiated themes for all about Android Gina.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.800]   I'm trying not to come in all gangbusters.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:30.520]   You know, Jason was really nice and said, well, if you have any suggestions,
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.880]   something we could do better or whatever.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.200]   And you know, you don't want to be the new person who comes in and is like,
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.760]   we need themes, but I'm hoping I can kind of.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.120]   We already have themes.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:41.720]   Yeah, Jason, you know, is actually the king of that stuff for TNT.
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.440]   So I have a feeling you would be more than welcome.
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.880]   I want you to come in gangbusters.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.960]   I want you to put your stamp on that show, Gina.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.320]   Yeah, I do.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.360]   All right.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:50.840]   All right.
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.560]   We're going to rename it Gina Trippani's All About Android.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.280]   I know.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:54.760]   No.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.120]   Featuring Gina Trippani.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.960]   With.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.520]   With.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:58.520]   With.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:59.640]   Special co-host.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.600]   Gina Trippani.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.520]   Yeah, we have lots of here's one of the the intros that we do on that show.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.040]   Hardware.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.280]   Hardware.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.840]   And then we have one for news as well.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:15.000]   Now they have no words, so they're just sounders?
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   Yeah, no, it's just it's just audibles.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.120]   It's good.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:18.600]   I like it.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.080]   Great.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:19.560]   It's great.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.240]   One of your stories I want to see
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.040]   that's on our on our log is why no Nexus accessories Google Google
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:30.360]   it can do everything well in the world, but it can't do product and retail.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.000]   I want to get that cool recharger for this thing.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.680]   I want things for my Nexus 4.
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.880]   Nothing.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.400]   What a keyboard for it.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.680]   Nothing.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.080]   Nothing.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.360]   I'll show you a nice case from 10 terra.
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.880]   These guys made a Nexus 7 case is really nice out of wood.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.400]   It's a wood case.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.040]   They don't make one for the Nexus 4 though.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.800]   So here's the question.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:59.000]   If I got myself a note to, does it replace the Nexus 7 and the phone?
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.760]   No.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.520]   No.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:02.840]   Okay.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.240]   Maybe but no.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.200]   What do you use Danny?
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:11.720]   I usually carry around the galaxy Nexus and the iPhone 5.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.200]   Those are like my main day to day phones.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.640]   And I've been using the iPad mini a lot for tablet.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:18.600]   I liked it up to.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.680]   It's just a little smaller than the mini actually.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.720]   It's you know, and I tried the galaxy as three.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:29.160]   I just thought it was too big, but I keep breathing.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:29.880]   It's funny.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.200]   I just moved and I was unpacking a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:37.480]   And I came across my Google developers phone from IO like 2009.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.760]   And it was so small.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.560]   And I thought, maybe I need to reconsider what I consider to be
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.840]   a too big phone.
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:47.240]   But actually I was thinking about the galaxy Nexus because the four,
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:52.600]   well, I have one because they gave them out to the press as part of the review process.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:53.720]   It's not LTE.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.280]   Right.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.160]   And I'm thinking, well, I'm about to go a whole year on the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.960]   And I'll probably stay on the Galaxy Nexus for another year because
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:02.360]   it's perfectly functional Android phone with LTE.
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:04.840]   And I don't see any really good alternatives out there.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.960]   I really wish that they had made the form with LTE.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:08.760]   It makes me sad.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.000]   And I, gosh, I wish they would come up with a better email client for Android.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.880]   I just want to kill them.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:17.320]   You're not a Gmail guy.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.640]   No, like I said, I like to have my email where the messages are discreet and individual.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.720]   But I have them grouped.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.680]   And that's what the iPhone does with their email client.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.880]   And that more than anything else is what has caused me to shift to using the iPhone more
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:36.920]   is because I get LTE and I get decent email and I get GPS.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.440]   Now I get GPS with both of them.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.520]   So, you know, from all the way, I got strengthened.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:45.320]   But Android's very good.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.560]   I agree.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.720]   I'm a big jelly bean fan.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:51.160]   I love it.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.200]   Yeah, I'm living there.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:55.560]   I'm not looking back on Windows phone better than any.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.320]   Both of them is that on a Windows phone, you can, if you're in the Twitter client,
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.800]   you can, if you do a search, you can pin that search to your home screen.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.960]   And then you just click on the tile and it automatically brings up,
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:11.560]   say, all the mentions of Lea Laport on Twitter and it pulls it up.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:17.240]   And there's nothing like it for Android or iPhone that I found.
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:21.160]   So if you have that unique, that unique need, Windows phone.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.400]   We'd do that.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.840]   That's a good thing.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:28.760]   Here's the funny thing, by the way, today's news, which we didn't get to because we were
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:35.640]   busy with Santa, but the news that Google and Apple and RIM bought the Kodak patent.
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.040]   Yes, for half a billion dollars.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:42.760]   Well, RIM probably threw in a couple of plugs and some free phones.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:45.720]   It threw a little walk for the ride, you know, just so that they were begging on the street
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.320]   quarter or somewhere in Canada.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.440]   That's an interesting point.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.840]   Well, RIM stock has been going up.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.440]   They might have some, maybe some cash.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.360]   What?
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:54.680]   What the heck?
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.480]   Danny, do you want to give us a tip or a tool?
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.080]   I will.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.640]   I'll give you the tip and I wrote about it on marketing.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.320]   I had today is, which is Google related to all those about Twitter.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.360]   Twitter made it possible for you to download all of your own tweets.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.000]   They've been saying they were going to do this for ages.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.920]   And I was like, yeah, who cares?
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.600]   You know, what I want to do is be able to search through my tweets that I can't get through
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:19.640]   because you only let us search through the past week worth of stuff.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.920]   And I was amazed.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.680]   It's not just that you download it, but after you download it and open up the zip file,
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:27.000]   you click on a little index file that's in there.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.440]   It's really easy to do.
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:33.640]   And it brings up a whole interface to all your tweets you've ever done.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.400]   You can go month by month and easily click to a particular month and see all the tweets
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.920]   that you've done in that particular month.
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:42.760]   And on top of that, there's a working search functionality where you can go through,
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.640]   do a keyword search and find whatever tweets you've done,
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.960]   mentioning particular words and go then from that listing right to them live on Twitter.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:56.440]   It is a real, real boon if you ever have to go back into your Twitter account to find things.
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.200]   And it makes up for the fact that, you know, Twitter and Google used to have a deal and that
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.800]   used to be how a lot of us, I think, who were trying to search Twitter used to do it,
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.320]   which was to go to Google.
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:09.480]   And since that deal collapsed about two years ago, it's been kind of a mess.
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:13.560]   So this is a really nice benefit to come along as much more than I was expecting.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.200]   Really nice.
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.360]   Where is this? I'm on my Twitter account.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.880]   I don't have it yet. It's still rolling out.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:18.840]   So you might not have it yet.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.120]   So if you go to a marketing land and you don't see it, I've got a bunch of screenshots
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.880]   and they'll show you what will happen.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.720]   It's the third story down on our site.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.360]   But yeah, if you're not seeing it, I got lucky.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.440]   Maybe they enable my account along with everybody else.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:33.480]   I didn't know it was coming today, but I went and I looked and there it was.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.160]   If you go into settings and you have it, you'll see somewhere in settings
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.120]   down near the bottom, it'll say request your archive.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.400]   And you click on that, you'll get a little email that comes back to you.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.600]   You follow on the email and you can keep the download.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:50.360]   And then you get the little zip file and then away you go and you start searching.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.520]   And then I did a follow-up.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.600]   Well, I surprised that they didn't add functionality around that themselves.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.200]   But that's an opportunity for you, Gina.
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:44:58.840]   A.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.560]   Well, yeah, and I know you did a call.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:05.640]   You did a call for developers to help you write an importer, right?
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:09.720]   My community around ThinkUp is really excited about this.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:15.000]   And we're working on an importer so you can download this archive and then suck it in to think up.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.920]   I mean, I started building ThinkUp because I wanted to archive my tweets.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:22.760]   And I honestly didn't ever think that Twitter was going to make this functionality available.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:24.120]   I started building ThinkUp.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:26.360]   It used to be called Twittledic in like 2009.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.640]   So I've been literally hoping for this feature for three years or almost four years.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.040]   So I'm really happy about it.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.400]   Yeah, we're building an importer now so that you can import your archive.
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:44.600]   And then my hope is to give users the ability to see different insights and stats and also search.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.160]   But I didn't realize that it comes with a search, a keyword search functionality.
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.360]   It's a really cool Danny.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.320]   I'm glad they did that.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:51.720]   And it must be what it's HTML file.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.560]   I mean, how are they doing this in HTML5?
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:54.440]   What is it?
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.640]   It can't be it.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.480]   I just don't know how they're doing it.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.320]   It was a second take when I went back and I realized that they had the search thing.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.160]   And I did a follow up thing on Search in Jelanda goes through it a bit more on how the search
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:05.960]   functionality works.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.040]   But I don't know if they're doing a JavaScript index or they're doing something.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:10.440]   It's something.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.120]   Yeah, it must be a JavaScript.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:12.680]   You have install.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.440]   It was all there.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:16.360]   It takes a moment where it's clearly running through it.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:17.400]   But boy, it runs through all this.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.760]   But it's running in the browser, right?
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:22.840]   So Gina, do you know what the format is?
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:23.960]   Is it an XML file?
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.240]   What do you know what you'll be getting?
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:31.080]   It's-- well, you get that viewable in your browser HTML version, but then you also get a CSV,
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.840]   which is important to any spreadsheet.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:34.280]   And then you also get JSON.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.840]   JSON-- adjacent features, which is great for developers.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.440]   And that's probably what we'll use to import into the ThinkUp data structure.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.720]   Make it very easy to scrape.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:45.640]   What's your tip of the week?
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.960]   I think I know because I tipped it off.
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:49.720]   You're going to be ruling the number.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:50.440]   This week you're ruling.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.240]   I didn't.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:51.720]   I didn't.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.480]   I actually-- it turned it into a tease.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.840]   Yeah, so the new Google Maps app for iOS is awesome.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.040]   But all the hooks into mapping functionality on iOS goes to the Apple Maps app.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.480]   However, I found this on Live Hacker.
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:13.880]   I found-- if you want Siri to give you directions using the Google Maps app,
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:18.680]   you have to add the phrase via transit to the end of your Siri voice command.
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:23.400]   So instead of saying, take me to the nearest-- in sort of destination here--
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.160]   say, take me this nearest gas station via transit.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.760]   And that, apparently, will launch the Google Maps iOS app.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.200]   Now, I haven't had a chance to try this out.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.480]   Did you get a chance to try this out, Leo?
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.760]   There's a video on the--
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:35.400]   Yeah, it works.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.040]   It's a part.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.640]   But it launches transit directions.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.080]   It launches transit on a Google Maps transit.
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.160]   It would do whatever-- because Apple knows there's no transit in Apple Maps.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.080]   It would launch whatever you had for transit directions.
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.000]   And of course, Google Maps is registered for that.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:49.640]   So--
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:53.320]   You'd have to then-- I mean, you're-- that now in the transit section,
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:55.320]   but I guess you could just tap a button and go into the--
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.520]   Right.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:57.000]   Right.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.360]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:47:58.760]   It's cool.
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:01.240]   It's a good, good hack to know.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:03.240]   This guy's got a nice desktop, too, I must say.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.680]   Me and transit.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.520]   All right, moving right along.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.480]   Have you played with Utter on the Android yet, Gina?
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.840]   I haven't.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.440]   Is that your-- is it a Twitter client?
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.360]   It's-- no, it's a--
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.240]   It's a Twitter you can't--
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.440]   Sorry, we're trying to--
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:16.840]   Utter.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.160]   Wait, um--
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:19.720]   I have to jump in.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:20.360]   Here, wait, Jeff.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:24.120]   Is it reading your mail?
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.280]   Uh, open Gmail.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:30.680]   Fire, wait, Jeff.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.200]   Open Gmail.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.920]   Open Gmail.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.240]   That kind of-- I mean, it's--
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.840]   It's-- I haven't played with it enough yet,
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.880]   but it's a very nice Siri replacement.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.000]   It's telling right now it's from Brandall.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:45.960]   It's in a beta.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.920]   Yeah, beta version.
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:47.400]   Beta.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:47.880]   Beta.
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:48.360]   Beta.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:48.520]   Utter.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.360]   There's quite a few of those.
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.520]   Yeah, this one looks nice.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:55.000]   Nuance has one also that's in beta that's--
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.560]   because everybody uses Nuance for the recognition.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.640]   What is your number, Mr. Jeff Jarvis?
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:00.120]   It's utter--
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:00.680]   Well, what do you--
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.600]   T-E-R like utter a word--
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.200]   Utter, not-- not cow-like.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:04.520]   Utter.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:08.040]   I wanted to do two quick plugs today.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.520]   I got-- I'm nowhere.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.440]   I got this invitation on Google+
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.040]   from Google Community in New York,
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.720]   and they said we're having a burger get out,
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:16.360]   I get together.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:17.400]   And so I went along--
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:22.120]   on to this burger place down 40th Street near me,
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:25.160]   and there's a dozen people, two or three from Google,
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:27.000]   the rest just Google+ users.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]   And I didn't know that Google+ did this.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.240]   And they said, oh yeah, we've gone on pizza tours
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.240]   in Brooklyn, and we've gone on--
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.280]   And Google--
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.640]   And you pay for your own burger.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.160]   It's not freebie or anything, you know.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.560]   You got to have a little swag if you want.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:40.520]   But it was a really nice thing.
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.440]   It's an amazing, huge, gigantic Google.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.920]   Has these nice little relationships with people.
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:46.360]   I thought it was very cute.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:47.560]   Doesn't scale.
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.280]   People don't.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.160]   But I thought it was nice.
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.360]   But that's not a number.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.080]   Also want to mention real quickly
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.000]   that Google is funding journalism scholarships,
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.320]   so look it up, my fellow journal wonks.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:02.120]   I would do the number one trending Google search for health.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:04.520]   It turns out last week is hemorrhoids,
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.200]   but that wouldn't be a very nice way to end the show.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:12.920]   So I will mention that the EFF's good work in patent fixing
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:16.760]   just got $500,000, a half from Mark Cuban,
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:20.120]   and half from a game developer, Notch Person.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:21.320]   So God's--
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.040]   Notch, notch.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.480]   Notch is Minecraft.
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.920]   Notch.
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.760]   He's like a saint.
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:27.640]   He's a god.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.800]   Well, my kids are fascinated by him.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:32.280]   Yes, if you're a Minecraft fan, you know who Notch is.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.960]   We don't have to explain that one.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.840]   I just showed somebody--
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:37.480]   I've done a very well--
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.360]   I've done a post-life craft.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.240]   I showed up with somebody I posted.
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.400]   I was a Swedish reporter who was very nice.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.160]   Katarina Anderson was my office doing a story
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.400]   for her media show back in Stockholm.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:50.280]   And I was talking about the early days of Twitter
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.960]   and Andy Carvin all that early on.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.880]   And I showed her a post-it from 2008,
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.200]   which I had to say Twitter, comma,
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.480]   a micro-blowing suit.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.160]   That's not allowed people to do this or that.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:01.080]   It was kind of cute that I had to explain what Twitter was.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.040]   That has changed.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:03.240]   You don't have to explain it anymore.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.920]   Now you explain what Twitter is.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:05.960]   That would explain us.
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.360]   So I have two tips for you.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:09.080]   One's a quickie.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:12.840]   If you're moving from Instagram over to Flickr,
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.480]   there's a instaport.me.
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.480]   You will very straightforward.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.160]   I mean, there's an API to do this.
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:21.160]   You authorize your Instagram account.
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:23.240]   You authorize your Flickr account.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.240]   You can download your images from Instagram,
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.720]   but you can also move them over to Flickr.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:28.280]   I did that.
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.600]   It creates a set called Instagram.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.160]   And all of your pictures are there.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:35.000]   Now I didn't shut down my Instagram account,
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.560]   but now I have my Instagram pictures on Flickr,
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.600]   which is nice.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.560]   And there's quite a few of them.
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.200]   That is nice.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.720]   Freethephotos.com.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:42.600]   Does it as well?
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:43.240]   That's the one I meant.
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.600]   Now, instaport does not do that.
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.560]   It's freethephotos.
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:46.040]   Thank you.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.480]   Freethe--
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:49.160]   I said the wrong one.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:52.040]   Freethephotos.com.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.960]   Very straightforward.
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:55.560]   It will send you an alert when it's done.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:58.040]   And then they do not save the images.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:02.760]   It's just a-- it's probably a little JSON conversation.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.840]   My other one, though, is important for anybody
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:08.040]   using a Samsung Galaxy S3 or Galaxy Note.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:11.640]   There is a whole pretty big one
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:16.360]   in the XNO4 processor and the Samsung kernel code.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.080]   And it lets an arbitrary-- any app hack your phone.
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:23.960]   So you should be very careful until this is patched.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:25.720]   Samsung's acknowledged that they say they're working
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:27.000]   and have a patch very quickly.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.800]   It does give you an advantage, though.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:32.680]   If you have one of the affected phones,
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.520]   it makes it very easy to root the phone,
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.720]   because you can use the same exploit.
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:40.600]   So there are patches to this.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.640]   If you have a Galaxy S2, S3 of international,
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.040]   the USS3s are safe.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:50.440]   A Galaxy Note or Note 2.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:53.880]   There are some issues with the camera,
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:57.880]   because the exploit takes advantage of the graphic subsystem
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.160]   on the XNO4 processor.
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.160]   And so fixing the exploit
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.560]   actually can break the camera in some cases.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:07.240]   But my recommendation is to get ChainFire's app,
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:11.800]   which is available at the xdadevelopers.com.
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:13.560]   It's called Exynos Abuse.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.480]   It's an APK, so you literally just download and install it.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.880]   You have to turn on third-party apps.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.320]   And once you've installed it, it's great.
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:24.600]   It's a one-click root for the affected phones.
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:25.720]   Makes it very easy to root.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.760]   Now I've used ChainFire software, so I have nothing--
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.240]   I mean, I can't guarantee you this is safe,
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.760]   because I don't know in ChainFire,
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:34.040]   but I've used a software before.
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:37.320]   It is a reputable developer in the root community for Android.
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:40.680]   And when you do the exploit, what's nice is you then--
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:44.120]   or the root exploit, you've rooted your phone very simply.
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:46.360]   I rooted my Galaxy Note 2 from Sprint here,
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.200]   but you also have a checkbox to disable the exploit.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.600]   You even have this, which is nice.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:56.040]   You can unroot the device, which is really great,
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:59.160]   because if you want to do OTA updates, you'll need to unroot.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.960]   So I'm sure Samsung will have an OTA update,
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:05.000]   but until then, either be very careful
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.280]   about where you get your apps from,
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.280]   because if you have one of the affected phones,
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.200]   it's pretty trivial to take over the phone.
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:14.360]   As you can see, this is a one-click root exploit like that.
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:18.840]   XNO's abuse at XDA developers.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:20.920]   It's a long thread, a long link,
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:24.600]   but the thread number is 2050297.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:27.400]   Maybe that'll make it a little easier for you to find it.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.560]   Boy, this was a fun and long show,
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:33.400]   and I am so glad you were here.
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.520]   As the expert on Santa tracking, Danny Sullivan.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.640]   It's amazing.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.560]   Who knew? Who knew?
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.640]   I've show a garage of it at some point.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:44.680]   For your kids, or your kids will,
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.080]   but we actually planned that.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.600]   That's why we had you on the show we knew.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.440]   That would be a big story.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.360]   You could find Danny's work at Search Engine Land,
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:53.800]   and not just Search Engine Land now.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:54.520]   You also have...
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:58.040]   Marketing Land, we just had our first birthday.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:00.520]   Happy birthday to marketingland.com.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.280]   Always great to talk to you, Danny.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.160]   You're the greatest.
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:03.960]   Appreciate it.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.000]   Jeff Jarvis...
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.760]   It's a Christmas tradition, I think, Danny.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:09.640]   It's a great thing to have Danny on any time we can,
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:10.520]   any time of the year.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.360]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:13.640]   Look for his book, Public Parts,
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:16.120]   available everywhere fine books are sold,
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:19.800]   or on Google+, in the new Twig community.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:21.880]   That's a good place to say hi.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.400]   Same thing for Gina, Gina,
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.400]   Tripani at smarterware.org.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:28.760]   Our new host on all about Android starting next month.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:31.960]   Now, we are taking next week off.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.840]   It's a best of, thanks to all of you who submitted,
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.080]   and our editors who chopped it up.
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:39.560]   So we'll have a best of this week in Google next week,
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.560]   December 26th.
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:45.960]   The following Wednesday, both Jeff and Gina are out of town,
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:46.520]   or something.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:47.240]   They're tied up.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.160]   But we have some guest hosts.
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:50.440]   Drew Lolanoff will join me.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.400]   Who else?
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.120]   We're talking to Kevin Marks and Aaron...
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.640]   And Aaron...
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:56.040]   Newcomb.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:56.600]   Newcomb.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:56.920]   Great.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.080]   Thank you very much.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:55:59.640]   Full cast.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.520]   Great to have you all.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:01.640]   Don't forget us.
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:02.600]   Yeah, don't forget us.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.320]   We back on the night.
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:05.800]   I promise they'll be back on the...
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:07.160]   That would be January 9th, I guess,
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.120]   will be the next episode.
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:08.520]   Yep.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:09.080]   Thanks guys.
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:09.880]   Great to talk to you.
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:10.520]   Happy...
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.160]   Happy...
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:12.600]   Well, I will say Christmas to you.
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.800]   Enjoy your...
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:14.360]   Grinch.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.800]   Enjoy your aluminum pole, honey.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:16.600]   Is Grinch.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.400]   Hope you get a colon.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:20.600]   You put stockings up.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.240]   We have to do how stockings up.
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:25.080]   Well, you know nobody's going to come film.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:28.600]   You're just going to be empty.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.040]   We don't have a chimney, Leo.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:30.680]   Come on.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.560]   You don't need a chimney.
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:32.440]   Santa's magic.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:33.400]   I figured it out.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.840]   He uses quantum mechanics.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.000]   He actually takes six months to deliver,
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.480]   but thanks to relativity, he's able to do it in a second.
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.800]   It's physics.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:42.760]   It's science.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.600]   And he'll be here in four days,
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.960]   10 hours, 35 minutes,
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:47.640]   and 10 seconds according to Google.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:49.480]   So there.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.920]   Counting down.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:52.120]   You'll see...
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.720]   Ms. Grinch.
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:58.600]   Oh, we're never going to let her forget that one.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.880]   Oh, man.
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.160]   I'm going to regret this.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.840]   You do believe in the tooth fairy, though, right?
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:03.960]   Well, of course.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:05.240]   Okay.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:05.880]   Just checking.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:06.840]   You want those...
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.320]   The Easter Bunny is pretty weird.
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:10.120]   I don't know.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.880]   The Easter Bunny is kind of weird.
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:12.440]   It's a little strange.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.560]   That's a weird one.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:18.200]   You know, you should see there's a movie you should see.
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:19.560]   Oh boy.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.520]   The Guardians movie.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.480]   The Rise of the Guardians.
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:22.600]   Rise of the Guardians.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.520]   You should see this and then see how you feel.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.240]   About all of that.
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.200]   Seriously.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:28.760]   Take Edda.
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:29.720]   She's not too young.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:33.240]   All right.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:34.040]   It's dream work.
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:35.640]   So it's got to be good.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.840]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:40.040]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:40.680]   at 1 p.m.
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:41.560]   Pacific 4 p.m.
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:42.440]   Eastern Time.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.400]   That's 2100.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:43.800]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.640]   2200 UTC now on twit.tv.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.960]   But if you miss the episode,
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.480]   you can always watch after the fact
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:54.360]   on demand versions available at twit.tv
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:56.840]   and wherever finder podcasts are aggregated.
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.880]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.080]   We'll see you next time.
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:00.280]   Have a great day.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:01.080]   Holiday.
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:10.280]   We'll see you next year on twit.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:12.860]   (upbeat music)
