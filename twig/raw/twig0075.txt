[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.240]   Well, happy holidays and welcome to our best of this week
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.720]   in Google.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.640]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.400]   And we thought for the holidays, we take a little time off,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   give the Twig crew a break for a week,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.560]   and put together some of the best moments from 2010.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.120]   And that's what you're about to see.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.880]   Actually, as we went through it, we realized
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   the Twig is much less about Google
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.040]   and much more about Chipotle, Glee, just kind of silly things.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.960]   No, there's a little Google in here, too.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.840]   So Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, and I,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.200]   and many of our wonderful guest hosts,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.360]   you're going to see some of the best moments in just a little
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.400]   bit.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.520]   Thank you for joining us all year long.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.560]   Thanks to our sponsors for supporting us.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.960]   And here's a cup of Michigan cheer to next year.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.560]   I know, I'm going to hear from all my friends
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.640]   at the Ohio State University and everywhere else,
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.480]   Clemson.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm sorry, I apologize.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.560]   It was the biggest mug I had.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.760]   All right, let's get on with it.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.280]   The best of Twig.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.160]   RMAA 801C, "Sing Into the Rain" and " Umbrella Mashup."
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.520]   Go version, Scott Free.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   This is quite a style throw.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   Was she a singer in an earlier life?
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   I can't, Elaine.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   A lot of auto tunes.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   He's in a little bit of live.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.320]   Eileen, who is the TMZ of Twig, tells me
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.520]   that "Twentest New Movie" is a country movie in which she
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.320]   sings the type of song.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.440]   She's a singer.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.560]   Ever since-- what's his name?
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.760]   Walking Phoenix played Johnny Cash.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   They all want to do it now.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   It's a dance, you know?
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.680]   Singing and drilling, standing in my umbrella.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   I didn't even go down, but it happened in here.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   I'm so glad I'm rewarding this.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   He's like up in the air and you're on the road.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   This is best stuff, material.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:34.300]   [Music]
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   [Music]
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.300]   I've got something here.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:05:16.300]   [Music]
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.300]   Alright, nothing.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:27.300]   So the guy who does these mashups is a big fan and is going to, has offered to send you Gina a disc of mashups.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   I think it's the holiday glee.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   There's a Christmas glee in process and he's going to send you an advanced copy.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.300]   What?
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.300]   Yes.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.300]   Yes.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300]   Your kid is.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.300]   Wait, like the guy who does the glee mashups?
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   Is he a fan of twig?
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.300]   Huge fan.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.300]   He's watching right now.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.300]   Oh my God.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.300]   He's a long time DJ music guy.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.300]   That's where I have this.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300]   He sends me stuff all the time and he said, "Do you mind?"
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.300]   I send you stuff.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300]   I said, "No, but I delete it because I don't want to get in trouble."
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.300]   Right.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   Because I don't, well, you know, it's not that I want, I mean, I wasn't going to distribute it.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.300]   Let's put it that way.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.300]   I guess I could put it on my tumbler.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.300]   Right, right, right.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.300]   That's awesome.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   Oh my God.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.500]   I sent you, and I told you, he said, "Can I send you the holiday gift?"
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.860]   I said, "The holiday music."
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.300]   I said, "I know who you could send it to."
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   There's a baby.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   It's cold duet between Kurt and Blaine and the Christmas episode.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.300]   So I heard on YouTube.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   You've heard that, huh?
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.300]   Oh, lovely.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.300]   So exciting.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   I'm so happy.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.300]   This is for you, Jim.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.300]   I really can't.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:43.300]   This baby is cold outside.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.300]   You've got to go away.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.300]   She really is a glee.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.300]   She's got a more than I have been willing to.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.300]   I've imagined.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.300]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.300]   What?
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.300]   The father will be pacing the blues to the fireplace.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.300]   Really?
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.300]   I'd better see you.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.300]   If you don't, then make me just have to drink.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.300]   Put some records on while I pour.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.300]   The neighbor is my favorite.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.300]   I'll help him.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.300]   It's too boy.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.300]   I have to do that.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.300]   That's what's awesome about a glee.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.300]   That's what's awesome about a glee.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.300]   It's awesome.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.300]   That's what's awesome about a glee.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   It's awesome.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.300]   You're my host for a little.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.300]   Wonderful.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.300]   I was, was, had this agenda.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.300]   It was like, okay.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.300]   It's the game.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.300]   It's not just the rubbish.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.300]   Okay.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.300]   You've got a problem with that?
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.300]   You don't want to get there.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.300]   We can solve that.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.300]   It's something called television.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.300]   And the power of TV is unbelievable.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.300]   To just completely, yeah, it's amazing.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.300]   And the music's good.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   I don't care.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.300]   I don't care.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   I'll watch anything where they burst into song.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.300]   I told you that last time.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.300]   I don't care.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.300]   The plots aren't that great, but I don't care.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.300]   It's cold outside.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.300]   The answer is cold outside.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.300]   Maybe the dance.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.300]   It's cold.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.300]   You better be tweeting on Broadway.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   We have to be funny.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.300]   We have to be tweeting on musical.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   We have to do it.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.300]   So Scott says, they do not get permission ahead of time for anything.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.300]   What?
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.300]   For anything.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.300]   He says, they just go, whatever, when they sue us, we'll pay them.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.300]   Or when they come in, when they write us a letter, we'll take care of it.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.300]   So he'll say, follow them and turn them into scruges for even going to ruin.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.300]   Nobody's going to screw with Glee.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.300]   So he says, the mash-ups, nothing.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.300]   We just go ahead and do whatever we want.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.300]   That singing in the random umbrella mash-up, though, was truly...
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   That's pretty good.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.300]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.300]   It's on my DVR.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   It made you wait the entire episode for it.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.300]   I was just a big wait for it.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   And it was so great that last...
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   I'm a big, very excited.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.300]   Very excited.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.300]   Who's the mash-up person's name?
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   I guess I could say his name.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.300]   Scott Free.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.300]   Scott!
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.300]   Scott!
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:11.300]   He wants to send you the holiday CD.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.300]   I'm so excited.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   That's it.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.300]   I'm just going to sit here and squeeze the entire episode.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   Please squeeze.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.300]   That was an earnest squeal.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   It's so cute.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.300]   I'm either squealing or I have tears in my eyes watching Glee.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   I really get into it.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.300]   You really do.
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:39.300]   It sounds to me what the Google Verizon Pack did is say, "Yeah!
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:48.300]   They'll be net neutrality for everybody except wireless carriers and wireless carriers like Verizon and AT&T who recently weighed in with...
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   Yeah, we agree.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   Wireless carriers should be allowed to do basically anything they want, including tier, differentiate services, charge more for some, less for others, essentially completely abrogate any idea of net neutrality and build in effect what some critics have called a dual Internet, a public Internet, and then a private telecom-based network for value-added services.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   Just the fact that we're using the term public Internet makes me want to kind of stab myself in the eye because that implies that there's another Internet, which is exactly what Jeff wrote about, right?
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.300]   There's a couple of Internet's, right?
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   I mean, it's that, yes, you have this old dog Internet showing you cat videos on YouTube, but, oh, you're not in your house right now?
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   Oh, that's not the Internet.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.300]   I said in my post, that's the Schmitt Internet as an Internet Schmitt Internet, right?
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.300]   And so, oh, it's a new service.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.300]   It's a, you know, an education service that didn't exist before.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.300]   Oh, sorry, sir, that's the Schmitt Internet.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.300]   And on the Schmitt Internet, we'll take you through all of our new fees and restrictions and regulations.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.300]   Please hold.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   Well, let me be the devil's advocate here.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:11.300]   And there's been some... there's some precedent for stuff like this in the early days of cable, for instance, cable Internet.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.300]   The FCC gave cable companies a lot of concessions.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:25.300]   For instance, the power of monopoly saying, in order to justify the cost of building this out, we believe the Internet's important.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.300]   We're going to give you some concessions here.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   Isn't that what's going on there?
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:38.300]   That because of the... it's clear that anybody who's using iPhone understands that when it comes to wireless Internet, it's a different beast.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.300]   And so, doesn't it make sense that there'd be some...
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.300]   Well, yes, no, we don't.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.300]   One thing is not...
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   No, it's not.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   Sorry, Stacy, go ahead.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.300]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   And then we'll go to Jeff.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:58.300]   No, no, I was just going to say, so the wireless stuff, I will 100% agree that you cannot have the same exact network management practices for wireless.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   It's clear.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.300]   Yeah, I mean, they're just not enough bandwidth.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   So, the way that they've phrased this, they've... instead of fighting for as much as one could hope for in terms of getting some kind of reasonable network management and coming up with some ways to define that for wireless, that may be different from wired, Google and Verizon have hijacked the whole process, taking it outside of the realm of the FCC.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   Yes.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   So, what's likely is Congress is going to listen to this and say, "Oh, yeah, and that's what he's already in a position right now where Congress is looking at scans at it and saying, "Whoa, there, you don't want to regulate the Internet."
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   Right.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.300]   Right.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   Yeah, I think that's exactly right, Stacy.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   I think that the problem here is that this was not the FCC or the government giving concessions.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.300]   This was the companies asking for their own concessions and saying this is their ideal.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   And you have Google, which only a year ago was pushing for the white spaces around broadcast to be freed from regulations so that they could become, quote, "wifi on steroids" in their words and could provide competition to the wireless providers.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:17.300]   And the whole idea of mobile and wireless becomes an oxymoron, becomes ridiculous, becomes meaningless.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:25.300]   So, I walk with my iPad, which I don't have, if you imagine I did, I walk with my iPad for my home when it's on Wi-Fi, I walk outside, it goes to cellular.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.300]   Sorry, you've just gone to the Schmidt Internet.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.300]   Now you can't get this and this and this, now you have to pay for this and this and that.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   And if that wireless so-called, that mobile so-called, came from some new provider like white spaces like new technologies, where does that go?
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   The Internet is the Internet is the Internet, damn it.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.300]   And if we end up with multiple Internet's, that sucks.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.300]   What Stacy's really quite right about is the problem is these guys, I still don't understand why Google did this.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.300]   I do not get why Google did this.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.300]   It feels like capitulation.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   It really does.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:07.300]   And the problem is that these guys negotiated the future of the Internet without the owners of the Internet sitting there.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.300]   And the owners of the Internet are us doing it.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:18.300]   And we've got to yell and scream and have a fit because the Internet is not Google's, it's not Verizon's, it's not the FCC's, it's ours.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   And I hate to plug this whole post that nobody cares about, but this is why I wrote this Bill of Rights in cyberspace.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   Because if we, the people don't stand up on principle and say, "But out!" asks wipes.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.300]   Get out of here. This is not yours. This is ours.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   Yeah, we pay for the broadcast.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:42.300]   What we want is more competition, more choices, more openness, more development, more people on the Internet.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   And if we start doing this, it's going to clamp down on this and it's going to clamp down on our economy as well.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.300]   Sorry, end of should be.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.080]   Axl, "A
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:15:04.300]   "X-X-O-Librias" in our chatroom quotes a past Google statement that says, "There's no network problem allegedly solved by prioritization that cannot also be solved by additional bandwidth."
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   Google in the past has said, "Just throw more bandwidth at it."
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:17.300]   Now, I guess that you still haven't answered my devil's advocate question, which is, because of the bandwidth constrained nature of wireless telecommunications, is it not unreasonable to say,
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.300]   it should be treated differently than land?
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   You can deal by that logic then should fiber to the house be treated differently from Calc Hopper.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.300]   Because it's more capable. All right, go ahead, Stacey.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:34.300]   Well, I was going to say carriers can treat it differently in a way that's perhaps competitive.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:40.300]   So things like congestion pricing, and I know people hate when, I mean, people hate tiered pricing.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.300]   Right.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:52.300]   I'm against it. It's a principle. But if you're worried about congestion on your network, don't limit people to, you know, five gigabytes per month.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.300]   Discharge the network.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   Charge the more for it.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.300]   Charge the more during times when you're experiencing usage.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:10.300]   Recognize the fact and tell consumers about the fact that if for some instance, like a hurricane hits, yeah, their video, their YouTube streams are going to be, you know,
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   be prioritized below voice calls. That makes sense.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   That's interesting.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.300]   I had never heard that before.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.300]   Is that a solution that people have been proposing?
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   That's what, I mean, Eric Schmidt will talk about that. I mean, when he was at the thing in Tahoe last week, he talks about, you know,
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:37.300]   figuring out how to prioritize traffic. And he made it sound like what Verizon and they were agreeing to, with something like that.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   And the carriers will also say that that's kind of their friendly face of this.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:50.300]   But there's no rules in place for that. And it's hard to write those rules into legislation without them being kind of subverted later on.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:56.300]   And that's why this is such a contentious issue. I don't know if you guys want nuance or not, but that's...
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   We do want nuance. We're absolutely, that's kind of what the show is about.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   We feed on nuance.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.300]   nuance is our middle day.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.300]   And I think that that's, to me, you know, what you're going to see is a very...
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   And we already have seen this very black and white. I'm again it or...
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.300]   I don't know if it was in favor of what Google and Verizon have done, but presumably somebody is AT&T anyway.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   But I think there is more than just the yes or no to it.
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:31.300]   That's what I'm trying to get at. It seems like there's some rationalization for giving at least temporarily.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   And maybe that's the mistake here, that this doesn't sound like a temporary measure.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   But temporarily giving wireless companies a little pass. No?
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   I think there's a place for doing real case by case adjudication.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:53.300]   That's probably the wrong word. At the FCC for net neutrality kind of rules.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.300]   The problem is right now the FCC doesn't actually...
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.300]   It's unclear if they have the authority actually enforce any of that.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.300]   Which is what this whole process is designed to do.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:12.300]   So implementing some kind of network neutrality in talking about reasonable network management on wireless networks.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.300]   By saying that you at least get something down.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:21.300]   And then when cases come up the FCC actually has the ability to go in and say,
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.300]   "Hey, carrier, don't do this."
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.300]   Right now that doesn't exist.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   The Park Stacey isn't that part of that is the FCC of course as of right now does not have authority over this.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.300]   Well there's some question about it after the Comcast reversal.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   Although I've talked to a number of offline conversations with people who say,
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.300]   "Well, you can't interpret the Comcast reversal too broadly."
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   The court didn't say the FCC doesn't have the right to do it.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   They just said it wasn't doing it correctly in this case.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   So it's very unclear what the FCC's mandate is.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.300]   And of course...
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.300]   What the FCC is trying to do you want to know?
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   Yes, I would love to know.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   What does the FCC think of this?
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   I guess they'd be another group that's against this because it's undermining their authority.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.300]   So my sources at the FCC are...
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.300]   They're staying silent on it.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   They don't want to comment basically on this because it's something that they...
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   They feel like talking about it can don't with this as a legitimate solution.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.300]   They don't want to legitimize it at all.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   But there is a clear power vacuum.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:40.300]   There's a clear lack of leadership from the FCC right now because of the whole reclassification debate,
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   which is what you're talking about after Comcast, where they're trying to figure that out.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:51.300]   And net neutrality is actually tied to that because if they don't have the authority to like
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:58.300]   legislate net route or regulate broadband, they can't implement net neutrality.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:04.300]   So they're really closely tied in the FCC is trying to work this from all angles.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.300]   And I personally think it's failing miserably.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:14.300]   And that gave Verizon and Google the ability to step up and propose this and get so much traction.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.300]   Google says that this is really...
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.300]   They're proposing a blueprint for legislation.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   It sure would be nice if Julius Genikowski or somebody...
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.300]   You know somebody at the FCC, Gina.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.300]   You were talking about it.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.300]   If somebody steps stood up and said, "Hey, wait a minute.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.300]   This isn't what..."
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.300]   There was a comment.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.300]   There was an official comment by Michael J. Cops.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   He said, "Some will claim this announcement moves the discussion forward.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.300]   That's one of its many problems.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   It's time to move a decision forward.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   The decision to reassert FCC authority over broadband telecommunication to guarantee an open internet now and forever...
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   This is my favorite part.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   But the interests of consumers in front of the interests of giant corporations.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.300]   That was the most heartening response I could have possibly.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   He's just one of five commissioners.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.300]   Sorry, he's just one of five commissioners.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   And so Cops is coming out strongly.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.300]   So you at least now see some discussion and some fighting.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:13.300]   I just put on the friend feed Susan Crawford, the brilliant Susan Crawford wrote a post this morning basically telling the FCC to grow a pair.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.300]   And I think that's the point.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.300]   I think Stacy, you're right.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   There's a vacuum.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   I think Gina, you're absolutely right that what Cops says is what they should all be doing.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.300]   But the problem is he's basically protesting against the FCC from inside the FCC.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:32.300]   Well, there's a long history of that by the way of division among FCC commissioners.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.300]   That's not at all unusual.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:39.300]   I'd like to know where Genikowski stands on this because, I mean, he's the one that needs to take a leadership role here.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:44.300]   And he's been very outspoken for internet neutrality.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.300]   I think he had a lot to do with the broadband plan that the FCC put forward.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.300]   You know, he did have...
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:58.300]   When the New York Times had that story on Monday saying that they had reached a deal and presented it somewhat differently than this.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:05.300]   Genikowski did say that basically he was pissed about this and that there would be no more meetings under their ages.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.300]   That's right.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   They did call off the conferences.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.300]   That's right.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   Stacy, go ahead.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.300]   You're going to say something.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.300]   Right.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   Well, those conferences weren't going anywhere.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:19.300]   And so, Genikowski called those off because they weren't making progress.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.300]   So, once this whole thing became public, he knew he was going to fail.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:31.300]   You might as well just fail without being casted in for having all these secret meetings, which is what's happening.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   Right.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:38.300]   So, instead, we've got this back room deal between two major corporations with what we thought were different interests,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.300]   but apparently are maybe not so different.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   Well, it's not really a deal.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.300]   I mean, it's not policy, right?
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.300]   I mean, Verizon Google Don't Create Policy.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   It's proposed policy.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.300]   It's a proposal.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   It's a proposal.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:55.300]   And also, let me just say, the wireless thing broke my heart, but the rest of the document is great.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.300]   Like, I'm with them the whole way.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.300]   The new services part, Gina?
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.300]   No, the wireless part.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.300]   Okay.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.300]   What is the new services part?
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.300]   Let's hear that story.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   Jeff, what is the new services part?
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.300]   Remember, Stacy's probably a better position to say it, but it's another carve out.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   Stacy?
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   There are three big...
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   I mean, there are three problems.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   One can escalate to the FCC.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   Actually, one would be wireless, but we talked about that.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   And then there's a carve out for managed services.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   They don't call it that.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.300]   They call it, "Oh, additional network services."
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:36.300]   And that's things like U-verse or FIO's TV or anything that the carrier...
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:44.300]   And the FCC has been all the way back in October and September was worried about this because it's a way to say,
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   in the worst case scenario, you know, this may not happen.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.300]   It may be crazy.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:24:00.300]   But to say, we're going to develop our broadband infrastructure and we're going to allocate X amount of it to our advanced network services,
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:04.300]   which cost extra, which, you know, you may have to pay the consumer.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   And if you want to get on it as a service, like a web service, maybe you have to pay.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   Maybe you don't.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.300]   We're not sure.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   And then what happens is you've got this like a link ghetto.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.300]   Yeah, but what's wrong with that? If Verizon has a VCast service that lets you watch broadcast television,
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   what's wrong with them saying that...
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.300]   That's fine.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.300]   That's, this is a private service.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.300]   But here's the problem.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   Okay.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.300]   It's a big open door.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.300]   It's a hanger door sized exception because it says...
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:37.300]   In fact, the example they give is that if an opera wanted to broadcast in 3D and it used a lot of bandwidth,
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   that's new and then that's outside of neutrality.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   Well, so anything new is just internet.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   Right.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   That, yeah.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.300]   And that's an awful thing.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   So if the ether makes a really good point...
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.300]   Go ahead, Gina.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut off Stacy.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   I was going to say, you know, the additional online services is very vague, vaguely defined, right?
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   We don't really know what that is.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   I mean, they're trying to future proof.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   They're trying to say, you know, new things are going to come out.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   We don't want to squatch innovation.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.300]   We want those new things to happen.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   We don't know what they're going to be, but we're just going to call them additional online services.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.300]   That's troubling.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:09.300]   Also, the definition of reasonable network management, you guys all seem to agree like, oh, yeah, mobile networks are different.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.300]   I don't...
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   I mean, yes, they're technically different, but are they really different?
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.300]   Like, what is reasonable network management?
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.300]   What does that mean?
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   Exactly.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   Like, I felt like the...
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   It could be as much as blocking YouTube over wireless.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.300]   Right.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   So, like, wireless networks, like the constraints that they are under, I mean, you've got a certain amount of spectrum, right?
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   And you have a certain amount of bandwidth that fits into each, like, megahertz of spectrum.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.300]   And the issue is if you're...
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   You send that to towers and people are moving in and out, and it's actually really complicated to keep track of.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   And so, there's the limited amount of spectrum, right?
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   Which kind of limits the capacity at anyone's place and point in time.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   And then there's also the issue of tracking these users as they're trying to, like, stream, which is really hard and, like, intensive over the wireless network.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.300]   And while other people are trying to do, like, voice calls.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.300]   And, you know, maybe we shouldn't be prioritizing voice calls.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   And in all, and in, like, a 4G network, we won't have to because they're all IP.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   Right.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   See, we talk about serious stuff, and that neutrality, actually, a big topic of conversation all year long, and I'm sure going into 2011 as well.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.300]   We're getting even more serious in just a moment with our conversation about man boobs.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.300]   But before we...
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.300]   You think I'm joking?
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   I'm not. I wish I were Joel Johnson from Gizmodo will join us in just a little bit.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.300]   But first, this is our holiday episode in case you didn't notice.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.300]   But first, I want to talk a little bit about my friends at Ford and the great...
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   FOUR-T-SINK!
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.300]   That was the best thing Santa brought me last year.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:56.300]   It was right around this time last year that I got my 2010 Mustang and discovered the wonders of Ford's SINK.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.300]   The whole idea of SINK is that when you get in the car, you shouldn't be disconnected from the world.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   But you should still be safe with SINK.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:10.300]   You keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road, and yet your car is connected.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:19.300]   You know, one of the things Ford very intelligently realized is that these smartphones we bring into our cars these days are improving at a much faster rate than any automobile can.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:25.300]   So by connecting to your smartphone, you get the features of the smartphone added to the car.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.300]   That was one of the brilliant insights behind Ford's SINK.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   Let me explain how it works.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:36.300]   You have a button on the wheel, you press the button, the lady says, you know, what do you want?
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.300]   And you tell her.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:47.300]   And it can be everything from setting the cabin temperature to playing a song, playing an artist, even playing more like that particular song that you're listening to right now.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.300]   Play next, play previous pause, you get complete control of your music.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   But you also can get turn-by-turn directions.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   Really good ones.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   They'll re-route around traffic problems because it's always watching what's going on.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   You also get 911 Assist, which I think is really, really important.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   It deploys.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   If the airbags are deployed, it calls 911, sends them GPS score and it plays a message and gives you a chance to speak.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.300]   It has, let's see, direction.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:19.300]   Oh, things like, I mean, things you wouldn't even expect, like sports scores.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.300]   You can find out how your favorite team is doing.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.300]   Up to date, live sports scores.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.300]   Movie times, gas prices.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.300]   It's a complete informational array.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.300]   Weather forecasts.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.300]   All available just by voice.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   It really understands your voice very well.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.300]   It's very effective.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.300]   I've never used anything better.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.300]   And I've tried them all.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.300]   This is what you want.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:47.300]   In fact, I know a lot of people now that get emails all the time, people who said, you know, I actually bought a Ford because of Ford Sync.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.300]   It's available in some Ford Lincoln and Mercury vehicles, standard in others.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.300]   Best thing to do, go to your Ford dealer and give it a try.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.300]   Have them demonstrated.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   Every dealer has a Sync specialist who can show you what's going on.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   And you can also go to the website, Sync My Ride Podcast.com.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   And they've got lots of videos there, so you can kind of see.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.300]   But really the best thing to do is to test drive the car.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:18.300]   Now, before we get back to this week in Google, I do want to mention a contest that's about to run out.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.300]   There's only a few days left.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.300]   December 31st, 2010 is the deadline.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   If you go to TwitfordFocused.com, you can enter what they're asking is.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   A two-minute video.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.300]   The winner will get a trip to Madrid with a friend to test drive.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   The all-new 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.300]   What a car this is.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   And Madrid.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.300]   I mean, how nice is that?
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.300]   This contest is available globally, by the way, to all our listeners anywhere in the world.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.300]   You'll also get $10,000 to donate to the charity of your choice, which is pretty special as well.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.300]   So if you want to enter this, go to TwitfordFocused.com.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.300]   It's a Facebook page.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.300]   All the details are there.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.300]   You'll be making a two-minute video saying why you should go to Madrid, which charity you support.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.300]   The fourth is going to donate a total of half a million dollars and all.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.300]   This is a really, really great deal.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.300]   TwitfordFocused.com.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.300]   I want to make sure you knew about that.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   And make sure you do it before the end of the year, available worldwide.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:17.300]   Now, let's get back to the important matter at hand.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.300]   Joel Johnson of Gizmodo.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.300]   And Man Booms.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.300]   Man's always looked like the iPad looked like its success was that it filled a lot of niches.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   Yeah, it's not good at anything.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   Well, I'm not sure I'd say that.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   I mean, it's great for watching movies.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.300]   It's great for-- it's actually pretty good for reading.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.300]   You're right.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.300]   It's not as good as a Kindle.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   It's better to watch on a TV than an iPad.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.300]   I love the iPad.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.300]   I think it's a great platform.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   But that's a great--
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:50.300]   If you were going to buy Joel, if you were going to buy a device other than a phone, well,
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.300]   I don't know, you had to do the wrong way to say it.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   If you were going to buy an iPad, given the current choices, do you think you'd go for the
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   7-inch Android or Dell's 5-inch Android?
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.300]   Oh, gosh.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.300]   Well--
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.300]   Dell's is a joke.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.300]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   We've looked at that ad.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   Have you seen the Dell Streak ad?
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   It looks like they're holding something that's swole up.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.300]   It's just wrong.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.300]   It's like a big candy bar.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.300]   They're holding a Hershey bar.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   It's just terrible.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.300]   But it's funny that you say that because it's still smaller than in some dimensions.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   Well, but it's smaller than the iPad, too.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.300]   But what I'm saying is it's almost like Uncanny Valley.
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.300]   There's an area between two decent areas, which is a phone--
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.300]   the 4.3 is as big as you can get, right?
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.300]   The Droid X or the EVO.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   Right.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.300]   And the iPad, which is the right size for the iPad, and there's those two work.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:47.300]   Well, the thing to me-- and this is, you know, tenuously about Google-- but I do think there's--
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:52.300]   when I hold an iPad and I use it, I feel like it's right on the edge of being too small.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.300]   Like, there's times where I'm like, oh, I wish this was just a little bit bigger.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.300]   Really?
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.300]   But I also don't want it to be bigger because I want it to be portable and to carry it around
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.300]   and all of that stuff.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   So I think a lot of the magic in any device screen size is finding where that point of tension is,
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.300]   where it's like, OK, this is--
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.300]   I wish it was a little bit bigger, but I'm glad it's no bigger.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   And the iPhone does that very well, and the iPad does that very well.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   And all of these other explorations of screen sizes, I don't think there's a magic number,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.300]   but I think it's-- there's probably a magic zone that Apple's probably somewhere within,
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   and there's not a lot of room to play there.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.300]   Yeah, so Steve was right.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.300]   Steve was right.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.300]   Gina, are you tempted by any of these tablets yet?
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.300]   No, not yet.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.300]   It's going to be a while.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   They ought to work it out.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.300]   What do you wait for?
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.300]   It's not going to be tempted until Google says this is the right version of Android to run on a tablet.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.300]   Well, you know what they're saying now, and 3.0 is imminent, right?
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.300]   Gingerbread.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.300]   Although somebody said 2.3 is out coming out soon too.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   I'm very confused.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:55.300]   So there's 2.3 maybe an interim thing than gingerbread because they already got the gingerbread man.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   And then-- but that-- but it turns out that it's honeycomb, really, is what you want.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.300]   I'm very confused.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.300]   Google's message is not clear.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   It isn't.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.300]   And this is an Android problem.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.300]   I don't think it's hurting them, though.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.300]   Oh, they're selling a lot of phones.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.300]   God knows.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.300]   Well, you know, it's a good point.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.300]   It becomes a generic device.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   I think is that, yes, there's the magic to the iPhone fine and the iPad.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   But then beyond that, I went to the quadrangle 4.0.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.300]   So you know, wait a minute.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   It's just real quickly.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   Look at the phone in her hand.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   They need to hire-- this is the Dell Streak Ed.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   They need to hire models with bigger hands.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.300]   Yeah, they do it.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   We talked about this on--
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.300]   That's a smart player.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.300]   Because look at that.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.300]   It just looks-- there's something just not right about it.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.300]   It's like, look how big that is.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   I don't know.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.300]   She carries it well, though.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.300]   She carries it well.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   And then he's got one.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   And look, they both have weird chocolate bars in their hands.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.300]   It's just-- it's--
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   You're meant for each other.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   Oh, you're one of the three other people who have this phone.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   We must be true love.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   So that's the Dell Streak.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.300]   That's a five-incher.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.300]   Seven-inches not quite right.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   Part of this also is really the operating system and apps have to--
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.300]   This is what Steve actually said in that earnings call.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.300]   He said, it's a developer issue.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.300]   They're not thinking like developers are thinking like, how are hardware manufacturers?
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   We can make it.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   He says, but we're software guys.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.300]   We think, yeah, but how's it going to look?
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   And can you make software that fits on a three and a half, four, five, seven, and up screen that works in all of them?
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   It's also though pocket size, right?
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.300]   I think that the Streak is the largest possible thing that will fit--
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.300]   Will it fit a man's pocket?
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   Will it fit in my jacket pocket?
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.300]   Your coat pocket.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   But didn't you know what?
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.300]   Jeff, you're the last man who still wears a jacket.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   If it doesn't fit--
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   If it's in my ironic overalls front pocket.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   Oskash, there you go.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.300]   But I think it has to fit in the breast pocket of your shirt, doesn't it?
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.300]   Yeah, that's what gets a little bit.
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.300]   Who even puts a phone in the breast pocket over there?
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.300]   Like, phones are for pockets at best.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.300]   Maybe belt clips if you must.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   Well, he got rid of his pocket protector, so just don't make fun of him.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   You're selling me that you think it's superior to have a belt carrier than in having your front pocket?
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   No.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.300]   Like, thigh pocket?
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.300]   No, because, well, I have keys in one and one and the other, and I don't want to sit on it, so I can't put it in my butt pocket.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   So it's got to go on the front.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.300]   And really, am I nerdy for putting my phone there?
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   I don't think you're supposed to put anything in your front pockets.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:40.300]   I think, except for handkerchiefs, it's like the only thing that is possibly supposed to go in there.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.300]   You want to know the real truth half the time I got two phones in my front pocket?
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.300]   Well, we're all outliers, you know.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   If you've ever looked at a Scott Evest and been like, "Well, maybe," then you're really fast at this kind of--
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   Well, Joel, Joel, this is a Scott Evest shirt.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   I like Scott Evest stuff, but I'm just saying, if you're at that point where you're looking for cable runs in your shirt, like, you can kind of--
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.300]   We're good, yeah.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:11.300]   So that's why I keep it in my front pocket, because I have a hole there that can go right up through here to the headphones that go around my back, and it's never mine.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.300]   On saying you're part of the problem.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.300]   I just feel that it camouflages my man boobs.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.300]   And not accentuate?
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   You took on geek boobs.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.300]   Oh, it might accentuate them. I never thought of that.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   Well, this thing at accentuate is just ones. You're like, you know, you've got the, like, pretty boob.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   It's been really wrong with me.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:35.300]   It's really has changed my entire perspective on it, so I'd like to rescind everything I said before.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.300]   No, you were right. They're agreeing with you. Don't put it in your breast pocket.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   Well, and I think to get back to the size of things, like, you're never going to put an iPad in your pocket, which means it might be the right size, you know.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.300]   And all these other tablets, any time they should--
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:55.300]   This is so typical. I mean, I've seen it hundreds of times over the years as a gadget blogger.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:02.300]   It's like they'll show you these model pictures of people using it, and it has absolutely no relevance to the real world.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   So you have to actually look out in the real world and see what people would do with it.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   Or what I often do is take stuff and show my friends, like, at a bar or something, and say, like, what would you do with this?
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.300]   And if they wouldn't put it in their pocket, then, you know, it's not nobody else is going.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   We're talking about Android, some Android sales numbers out. We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   Gina's got a-- but you haven't set it up yet, the Google TV.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.300]   No, yeah, I haven't received enough. It's a piece of stuff.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.300]   I have mine. I've talked about it already a little bit.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.300]   Look at Leo.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   He's got to ruin me.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:39.300]   You know, I'm really tempted to unhook it, but I'm going to wait until Gina-- you know, here's-- well, we'll talk about it in a second.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   There is a deal.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.300]   Have you seen this? This is the new Windows Mobile Fund.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.300]   I saw you showing up.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.300]   I was watching your demo a little bit before a show.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   It's Windows. It's mobile.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.300]   You know, it's sad because--
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.300]   It's slidey.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   It's actually very snappy.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   Had this come out before the iPhone and the Android phone?
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.300]   You'd be going, "This is the amazing!"
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.300]   Would that have come out before Android and iPhone?
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.300]   Oh, well, I guess not.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.300]   [laughter]
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.300]   Not in that way.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.300]   I guess not.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.300]   But you like it?
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.300]   Well, it's fine, but we already have Android and iPhone.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.300]   And Blackberry, if you want to be really generous.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.300]   Is there any logic to it?
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   How's the UIs?
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   It's fine.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   I love it.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   You know, it's a nice UI.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.300]   It's very usable.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.300]   It's very-- I'll tell you what.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.300]   There's a lesson for Google in a couple of areas.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:39.300]   First of all, because Microsoft said this is the hardware spec and you must adhere to the hardware spec,
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:44.300]   all of them have the same 5 megapixel camera, the same gigahertz processor.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   There is a varied amount of RAM and storage, but essentially you're getting an 800 by 480 screen.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   There's a certain consistency across the hardware that is a good thing.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.300]   And that's one of the problems Android has.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.300]   But of course, Android is open.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   You know, I was thinking about this this morning.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:06.300]   Google, of course, knew that that would be an issue, but they chose-- from a philosophical point of view,
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:13.300]   we prefer to open source it to keep the open handset alliance, to let the manufacturers do what they want with it,
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   because-- and it's worked for them.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   We're going to talk about those numbers in a bit.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.300]   On the other hand, I think Microsoft can quite reasonably say, yes, but look, this is a very consistent experience across the board.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   This is the Samsung Focus, which is very much like the Captivate, the Galaxy S that Samsung has Android on.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.300]   So just think of it kind of as a Galaxy S.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   Are you taking Pilates?
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.300]   Yeah, every three times a week.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.300]   You should see my core.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   I'm working on my-- it's all about the man boobs.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.300]   So these are the tiles.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   You see, and you can have your friends in the-- you know, you can have these-- everybody has a tile.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.300]   It's very people focused and socially focused.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.300]   So you see how quickly that works, though?
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   So you can see-- I mean, there's just-- these are recent calls.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.300]   Gina, I don't see us there.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.300]   We don't have tiles.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.300]   Well, you don't-- you would have a tile if you would tweet or Facebook more often.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.300]   Every company learns this at the beginning of AOL, very back in the early days.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:14.300]   They made rest a bad word, and the breast cancer community was, of course, properly up at arms.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.300]   Not to mention foster farms.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.300]   Yes.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.300]   How you guys search for chicken?
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.300]   But you can't search for Jeff Spieners' posts, either.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.300]   I can't.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.300]   Really?
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   No, that's a disservice.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.300]   No, that's bad.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   Let me just search for J-E-F, F, apostrophe S, P-E-E-F, and then you can search for--
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:38.300]   P-E-N-I.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:43.300]   Well, I got small penis jokes, ignite airport meltdown.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   I'm sure we're--
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.300]   And it goes blank.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.300]   There you go.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.300]   Well, I'm so sorry, Jeff.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   We're going to have-- we're going to have parents kind of looking over the shoulder of kids and across the room going,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.300]   "I see that screen is blank."
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   That's great, why are you searching for kids?
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   What were you thinking?
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:08.300]   So if I search for B-O-O-B-- oh, there it goes.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   Oh.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   It's going to be a new game.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.300]   Yeah, now we have another new dictionary of don't-o-word.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.300]   White words, we'll call them.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.300]   White words, white words.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   White words, white words.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   All right, well, anything-- I mean, we took 10 minutes and we've discussed the whole thing.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.300]   Is there anything more to say?
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   Well, I think there's some subtleties to this.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   The thing is that Google has said in the past that 20% of queries at any given time are unique they've never seen before.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   What?
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.300]   Yep.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   Wow.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   That's a stat that they published several times and I can find science.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.300]   One in five.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.300]   Wow.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:50.300]   Because there's diverse number of things that people type into it, which makes some sense.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.300]   This was always their point about serving the long tail and not just doing the top few queries.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.300]   And that was a Google in depth thing that helped them compete with others.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:03.300]   But this is going to change that because you're going to get a lot closer to other people's queries all the time.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:09.300]   And this is a subtle effect from that, which is that you're gradually being pushed into the things that other people have searched for before.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.300]   And we've had a bit of that with the auto-complete already, but this is going to make that much stronger.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.300]   Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.300]   It sounds like a bad thing.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   I think it's a bad thing.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.300]   I think it's a bad thing.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.300]   It's suddenly Google is very normative.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:26.300]   I read a long post about this last night when I was playing with the Google scribe thing, which we could maybe talk about in a bit.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   Yes.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.300]   But that was like...
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   I'm trying to come up with a search that nobody's ever typed before.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   "Baboon frenzy inside my pants."
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.300]   Oh, God.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.300]   Nope.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   See, there's a search.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.300]   Put that in quotes.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.300]   Put that in quotes.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.300]   Oh.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   All right.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.300]   Let's see.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.300]   I have to pluralize.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.300]   We used to play the game "Gootle-Wet-Leo F" here's a door to it.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.300]   It'd be fun.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.300]   Fears a door.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.300]   No results found for "Baboon frenzy inside my pants."
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   I have found the end of the internet.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.300]   He is a door of "Baboon frenzy."
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   It's got to be the first time.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.300]   [laughter]
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.300]   So, but I just...
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   It stuns me.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.300]   It does not sound credible that one in five searches are something Google's never seen before.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.300]   That's one of the stats that stuck with me because it is discus striking.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   What are people searching for that's so bizarre and weird?
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   It's just that language is generative and you can stick words together to make a phrase
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   that no one's ever said before.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   Well, you can, but it's usually nonsense.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   No, that's the way that language is structured.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.300]   It isn't.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.300]   You have clusters of ideas.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:42.300]   The interesting thing they said in response to that was that when they watch people using it,
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.300]   we were talking about this is going to mean that you don't have to just get on the first page.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   You have to get on the first three results for the first two letters.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   But they said people will keep typing stuff and adding words to try and bring the one they want up to the top.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.300]   Even if it's like forward down, I want that further up.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.300]   I want that further up.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.300]   I'm going to move it up the screen.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.300]   I think you raised a really important point on the industry here is that for various reasons,
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   we see the defrocking of the SEO wizards.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   And that was because we see how much more personalized search is.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   And so it's hard to say, well, I rose you up 10 stops from Gina.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.300]   You did, but from Mark, Kevin, you didn't.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.300]   And also, I think you're right.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.300]   What you just said is that the first page isn't even the issue.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.300]   The first three listings are the issue.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:27.300]   Right.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   And back to your other point, Leo, about the, you know, going to all the same.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   It's not just that you go to the same that everyone else goes to because it's personalized.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.300]   It's going to go to what I've gone to all the time before.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.300]   And someone in Twitter said to me, well, I don't want to go to what I've gone to before.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.300]   I want to be surprised.
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.300]   I want to go to anything.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   Right.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.300]   By the way, the chat room is explaining to me why one in five has never before.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.300]   It's been seen in Google.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.300]   Of course, I should have known this misspellings.
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.300]   People are surprised.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   It's a message in a different language.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.300]   Oh, no, I think people are idiots.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   That's really the reason.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   Let me.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.300]   And but now Google does, of course, the spelling corrections and these work as well in this
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:07.300]   instance search.
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.300]   So if I start typing C-A-L-A, calendar properly spelled is the first item on there.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:18.300]   So the spelling suggestions have now kind of incorporated into the search results.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   It doesn't even say, did you mean calendar?
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:28.300]   So this is, I, you know, I think this is helpful.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.300]   I'll be very curious that somebody asked Marissa, well, how many people in your testing
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.300]   said they didn't want it?
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.300]   And she said some did, but you could turn it off.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   I'd be curious to see what the results are in that regard.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   If a lot of people turn it off or not.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   Hmm.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.300]   What else?
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.300]   Just amazing.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   Justin Bieber has JU.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:49.300]   Not only does the guy have his own racks at Twitter, or server.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.300]   Did you see that?
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.300]   He's got like three or four servers.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   That's a myth.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.300]   Oh, he's got JU.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.300]   Does he have JU for you, Leo?
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.300]   Nope.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.300]   Is it just somebody?
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.300]   Somebody's been searching a little bit.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.300]   I've been searching a little too much for Justin Bieber.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.300]   I don't know what to do.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.300]   Justin, Justin, TV.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.300]   I get, yeah, I get Justin TV, but JU.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.300]   Excuse me, Justin Bieber.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.300]   Interesting.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.300]   I really just search for Justin Bieber very much.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.300]   Justin Bieber tattoo.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.300]   If I, now that's what I want to see.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   Faculty of early days.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.300]   I was one of the Jeffs on the first page, but I can't even find myself now.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:29.300]   But you make a good point because I was typing in Leo and I chose up, I show up very well
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.300]   if I'm logged in.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:37.700]   But as soon as I log out, it's that stupid, Deutsch English dictionary, Leo.leo.org that
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.020]   beats me every time.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.420]   You win Leo Space.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.300]   I'm Leo in my own Leo Space.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.300]   I have a life, life Leo is top result for you for Leo.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.300]   Oh, good for you.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.300]   Oh, thank God.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.300]   And Leonardo da Vinci.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.300]   It's a pretty good company.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.300]   Not Leonardo da Caprio.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.300]   It's all he's there to think he's pretty good company too.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.300]   The TMZ searches are coming through, aren't they?
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.300]   All right, I'm just going to shut up.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.300]   I'm going to stop revealing.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.300]   It's revealing, isn't it?
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.300]   That's very interesting.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.300]   It's very revealing.
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.300]   I'm letting I'm reading it to you.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.300]   So I'm going to shut up now.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   I get Leonardo.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:14.300]   I get Leo gets me first then Leonardo da Caprio Leonard Cohen, Leona Lewis and Leo LaPorte.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.300]   But that's pretty good.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.300]   And I don't, oh, I get you.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.300]   I get you number five.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.300]   That's a normal search.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.300]   On the topics.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.300]   Right.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.700]   If I log out, I will get and I type Leo, I will be sixth down on the list if I log out.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.940]   So it really is paying quite a bit of attention to your search history, obviously, which
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.940]   I should.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.380]   I wonder now, where does that happen?
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.540]   Does Google, is that happening in the server side or client side?
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.140]   Is Google sending to the browser my search history?
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.140]   I guess it knows.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.140]   No, it knows it because it's in the server.
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.140]   Yeah, they have it on the server side.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.140]   That's one of the settings.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.140]   Of course.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.140]   It's in the dash.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.220]   This is, I mean, just a piece of engineering right here.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.180]   I mean, not to be a total Google fan girl.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.340]   I mean, I am already.
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:56.700]   Because I feel bad about being so far up one company's butt.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.460]   But, you know, this is a pretty good butt to be because this is really amazing.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.420]   I mean, this is like a show title.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.060]   Feed of engineering.
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.060]   What's going on here?
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.220]   I mean, I, you know, I'm starting to just get a little experience with non-trivial data
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.940]   with think up and it's hard and it's slow.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.020]   It's incredible what they're doing here.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.020]   And I just, we have to kind of, I want to just acknowledge that.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.940]   I mean, what's going on is really kind of amazing at the speed that it is.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:29.820]   You know what saddens me is, you know, I'm watching the chatroom as we're, during
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.980]   Mac Great Bigley's, I'm talking about the fact that this is a bad trend towards a closed
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:39.660]   ecosystem and they're going, oh, you sound like such an old man.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:47.780]   There's a great comic, XKCD comic in, I'll see if I can find it, in which the open source
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.900]   hacker guy is saying, well, I'm fighting to keep this stuff.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.500]   Open for you and, oh, but I like it closed.
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.500]   I like it.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.500]   It's good.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.740]   And then of course it closes in on the, on the normal guy and the hacker said, I told
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.860]   you, we're fine for you, baby.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:07.860]   You got to understand it feels good now, but it's not going to feel good in the long run.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.860]   So what are we going to do about it?
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.860]   Damn it.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.260]   Well, I'm doing everything I can on this network to raise people's awareness that we
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.260]   are.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.860]   Unfortunately, the people who watch this are probably already aware.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.860]   We're all preaching the choir.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:22.860]   We're preaching the choir.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:23.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.940]   So we need to save the link and save cookies, t-shirts.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.100]   Jeff, you really are doing them a lot.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.740]   I mean, you're really getting out there and you filed with the Supreme Court in Canada?
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.380]   Yeah, they came to me on this case and because I write about the link economy and the value
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.260]   of the link and they reckon these lawyers recognize they were smart enough to realize
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.900]   that what could happen here is the degradation of the value of the link.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:51.220]   And so I gave them a bunch of my stuff and I filed this little affidavit and I amended
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.220]   what they wrote for me.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.740]   They interviewed me, they wrote it and they used words like "barrel-y."
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:07.060]   And so I added something in there about how doing this to the link would put a chill on
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.100]   free speech and they said, "Oh, no, sorry.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.220]   That would be very cheeky to say to the Supreme Court of Canada."
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.220]   I said, "I'm American.
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.220]   Of course I'm cheeky."
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:18.220]   This is the XKCD cartoon.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.220]   2003.
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.060]   Did you get my essay?
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.580]   Yeah, it was good, but it was a doc.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.580]   You really should use it more.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.380]   Oh, give it a rest already.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.020]   Maybe we just want to live our lives and use software that works and get wrapped up in
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.020]   your stupid nerd turf wars.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.860]   I just want people to care about infrastructures.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.860]   We're building a new...
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.580]   No, you just want to feel smugly superior.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.300]   You have no sense of perspective and are probably autistic.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.220]   Flash forward seven years later, 2010.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:47.420]   Oh my God, we had a control of our social world of Facebook and they're doing evil stuff.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   Do you see this?
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:54.140]   It's the world's tiniest open source violin.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.140]   Says it all right there.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.140]   A lot of XKCD.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.140]   I do too.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.140]   The smallest open-source violin.
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.140]   I love that.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.140]   That's it.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.140]   The world's smallest open-source violin.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.140]   I love that comic.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:11.220]   Actually, people, I got an email the other day from somebody who said, "You guys talk
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.220]   too much about open."
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.740]   So I sent a link to that comic.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:14.740]   It's important.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.740]   It's important.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.580]   Even XKCD says, "Oh."
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.580]   So we're going to come back.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.580]   We've got lots more.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.320]   This is our holiday special.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:26.380]   This week in Google, some of the best moments from 2010 with Gina and Jeff and the gang
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.860]   and that we're glad you're here and hope you're enjoying your holiday season.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.020]   We decided to take this week off to...
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.900]   So we could spend time with family and friends for the holidays, but we'll be back next week
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.500]   with more this week in Google.
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:42.140]   We do the show live every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific time.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.380]   That's 4 p.m. Eastern on live.twit.tv.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.180]   We do invite you to join us live.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.900]   We watch the chat room and often have feedback from the chat room so you can chat along with
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.260]   us as we're doing the show.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.420]   And also, there's stuff before, during, and after that gets edited out.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.260]   It's a lot of fun too.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.060]   I think watching it live is always best if you can.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   Live.twit.tv.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   And who knows?
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:07.060]   Maybe I'll get another Chipotle bowl before the end of the year.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.660]   We're going to get back in just a second with more from Twig.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.100]   But before we do, I want to talk a little bit about anti-spam filtering.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.580]   If you use Gmail for your mail, you don't have to worry about spam.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.820]   But there are many of us, I include myself, who run our own servers.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.140]   I run leoville.com.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:28.420]   Some companies don't want Gmail to have access to their email for security reasons.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.660]   Maybe they can't for legal reasons.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.140]   That, you know, HIPAA and so forth.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.820]   For those people, people who run their own servers, finding spam is a big deal.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.940]   And that's where mail route is such a blessing.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.100]   I've been using it since 2004.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.580]   A very low, one in 250,000 false positive rate.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.740]   I find it even lower than that.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.380]   In fact, I've never had a problem with false positives.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.260]   Mail route just gets the spam and leaves the rest.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.540]   And it does it transparently easily.
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.900]   If you can change an MX record, you can use mail route.
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.540]   Find out more at mail route.info.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.540]   Very affordable.
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.540]   A great deal.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.900]   My friend Tom Johnson does this.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.300]   And I love giving him a plug because he's been doing such a great job fighting spam
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.100]   for me since 2004.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.700]   Mail route.info.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.700]   Use that URL.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.780]   You'll get 10% off the life of your account.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:22.180]   Now back to this week in Google, Jeff, Gina, and me.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.980]   And what are we going to talk about on this episode?
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.620]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.380]   That desktop app for Google Voice.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.940]   Well, I'll let Gina explain.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:34.180]   If you don't have a Google Voice account, go and get one because it's open to the world
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.180]   now.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.180]   Everybody can have one.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.180]   On the US, yeah.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.180]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.180]   Did I say the world?
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.180]   The US.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.380]   I got in big trouble for that.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:42.380]   So you're right.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.380]   Just walking out for you.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   Right.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.300]   You know, a third of our audience is outside the US.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.940]   So a third of you cannot get this.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:48.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:49.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.940]   This that's what the.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:56.020]   Yeah, you should do this show in German because we have a huge German audience.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:01.140]   A lot of Scandinavians, a lot of Brits, Canadians, Australians.
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.820]   You know, it's the nature of the internet broadcasting.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.860]   It's not national.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.980]   And that throws everybody, including all of our advertisers for a loop.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:10.980]   And us, right?
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:16.820]   Because we'll say, go out and get Google Voice and they know can't stop telling me about
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:17.820]   it.
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.540]   I didn't realize what a big fat American I was until I started writing online.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.860]   It's very exactly.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.340]   It's really good for us to remind us we are not the only ones.
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:30.100]   Well, if you live in the US, do get Google Voice because it's really a great.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.900]   And if you have, if you're, in fact, it's, like I said, the beginning of the show, this
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.780]   is the reason you use an Android phone.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.060]   It becomes your voicemail on your Android phone.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:39.060]   It's so much better.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:41.660]   I know people love the Apple visual voicemail.
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.700]   I like the, I really prefer it because I can get texts.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.700]   I get the emails.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.700]   I can listen.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.100]   I mean, just better all around.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:53.660]   Anyway, so what is this petition to do something different on Google Voice?
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:58.540]   Well, to, to make a desktop app because it's become religion in Google, accordingly, the
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:01.100]   founders that they will only do browser apps.
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.740]   And now you have people saying, no, we, it's not good enough.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.940]   Browser's not ready.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.860]   We want a Google Voice desktop app.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.940]   Well, the problem comes from the fact that they acquired Gizmo and promptly killed the
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.940]   Gizmo app.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.940]   Right.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.940]   And that was a great app.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.420]   It was a SIP phone that you can use.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.460]   There are other, there are other apps out there, but I thought Gizmo is the best of them
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.460]   all.
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.980]   So they're, they're already have the app.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.860]   It's almost like, just release it.
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.860]   It's really interesting.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.100]   It's really a very, pretty hard stand, you know, that their platform is the browser and
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.500]   they want to stick to it.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.460]   But you know, Google has some desktop apps, Picasa.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.460]   Right.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:47.020]   I mean, there are some installable Google, Google Earth, Google Earth, Google desktop,
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.020]   Picasa.
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.020]   What a smart.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:50.020]   Don't kill Google Earth.
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.020]   I'd be furious or put.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.020]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.060]   And just, there are some apps that just, you know, work better on the desktop.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:02.260]   What happens if you go to a Chromium world and the Chrome browser as operating system?
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.260]   Right.
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:06.020]   Or they're going to have apps that won't work then.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.020]   Oh.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.900]   So they're, they're, for once they're thinking ahead that way.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:14.900]   But I think what's really cool here is the opportunity for Google to be the anti-apple.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.740]   No one would ever think of telling Steve what to do.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.740]   Ever.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:19.740]   Right.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:24.260]   But thousands are ganging up to think, well, Google might listen to us.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.260]   I think they should.
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.420]   I think they should.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.860]   If there's a demand for it, why not?
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:34.580]   I feel like Google's had been really good about having this, about showing that they
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.460]   listened and having this sort of continual conversation with users.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.460]   Right.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:43.100]   You know, unlike the sort of letter from Steve Jobs on Hi, it seems like Google's been doing
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.940]   especially a good job in the past couple of years of, of blogging and responding and
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:50.020]   changing things when they didn't work, you know, when the background images rolled
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.580]   out, they pulled them back immediately.
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:56.300]   I mean, you know, they're, it seems like, you know, you can still do it, but you opt
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.300]   in, right?
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.580]   So it looks so much like Bing, but I actually did it.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.500]   And some of the images are really beautiful.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.300]   I kind of like having an image on my, on my Google.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.540]   See, I've got the, I don't know what that's the Casbah or something.
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.060]   I don't know what that is, but it looks so much like Bing.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.340]   Yeah, it does.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.980]   Unlike Bing, though, Bing, it changes every day on this.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.780]   You have to change it by hand, which I think is not good.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:23.540]   I mean, it's pretty and I can remove it.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:27.140]   And then you click change background image and then they give you some choices, but you
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.100]   could do it from your own photos.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.660]   There's some really pretty images.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:36.780]   I don't see why they wouldn't just have a desktop app and a browser based Google voice,
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:42.940]   you know, like that, you know, all their desktop apps have sort of web counterparts, right?
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:49.220]   So like Google Earth is Google Maps, Picassas, Picasa Web, even Google desktop kind of integrates
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.780]   web search results with your desktop search results.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:57.020]   I don't see why they shouldn't do both, especially like you said, Leo, they have the app, right?
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.660]   They have the Gizmo app.
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.660]   Right.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:02.260]   It just be a matter of rebranding it.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:05.420]   Have you seen this Chrome fast ball game?
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:06.980]   Did we talk about this last week?
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:07.980]   We did.
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:08.980]   It was down when we tried it.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:09.980]   Was it back up?
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.620]   I hadn't tried it since we, we couldn't try it before.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.500]   This, this is because they build flash now.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.020]   Yes, it's up.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.900]   They build flash now into the, into the browser.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.020]   It comes with, comes with Chrome now.
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.380]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.180]   What, what, what's going on?
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.180]   What help?
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.180]   Help.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.180]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.180]   Is it just doing it?
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.180]   Am I supposed to click on anything?
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.220]   Oh, I see.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:39.980]   Choose the fastest mode of transportation between point A and point B. A straight line?
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:40.980]   I don't know.
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.980]   Huh?
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:46.420]   Uh, uh, uh, bicycle.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:47.420]   Biking five minutes.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.420]   Get there faster.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.420]   Uh, car.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.420]   Okay.
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.420]   Four minutes.
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.420]   Yes, that's it.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:53.420]   Chrome fast.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:54.420]   Okay.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.420]   That's kind of a stupid game.
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:57.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.420]   Okay.
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.420]   What's happening?
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.860]   I don't know what the hell's happening.
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:04.140]   Tweet the fastest ball you could think of.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.940]   Um, uh, uh, a, a, a cheetah ball.
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:08.940]   Cheetah ball.
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.940]   Okay.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:10.940]   That's the fast ball.
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:11.940]   It's tweeting.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.940]   It's not a ball I recognize.
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:15.780]   Uh, uh, uh, fast ball.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.780]   I'm seeing there.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.620]   Uh, fast ball, fast ball.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.620]   Okay.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.620]   There I'm tweeting it.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.620]   That speed depends on you.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.620]   My friend will give you an average speed this time.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.620]   That's an average ball penalty of five tweets.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.220]   I don't even know what's going on.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.220]   Go.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.220]   Oh, geez.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.860]   Have you played this yet?
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:38.460]   I haven't, but now I'm scared.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:39.460]   It's what?
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.460]   Okay.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.660]   Next translate that.
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.780]   That looks like it's in, uh, I'm going to say Hungarian.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.580]   Hungarian translated into English translate.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.220]   No, close, but try again with fewer options.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.220]   You get everything right.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.820]   You get a job at Google.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.260]   Uh, he's, uh, it's not, it's finished.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.260]   It's finished.
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.260]   That's it.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.460]   I think the ball was lost in translation.
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.460]   Oh geez.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.260]   Uh, oh, I slammed it.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.260]   It's close.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.340]   I know it's making me crazy.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.900]   It says a ball in motion will stay in motion.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.420]   Do you think it's different every time?
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:18.220]   I don't get it. I don't get it either. It's very postmodern Jeff
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:25.700]   Choose an artist selected artists bridge what help the ball by spelling bridge out of band names? Beatles?
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.500]   You guys aren't helping me at all
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.760]   Ariana
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:38.360]   Oh India pop
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.360]   Oh

[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.880]   No, no D D D
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.880]   Danger mouse
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.920]   Danger mouse, okay doors that was better. Okay g
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.940]   Gorillas

[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.440]   And yeah
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:26.580]   Way to reveal I hope they don't call it this information so my time is to wait but there's more search for three things that have decreasing search results
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.800]   Jeff Jarvis
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.280]   Okay
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.440]   Leo Le Port
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.600]   Yes, so far so good. Okay, who's less than us Jeff?
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.560]   Dan
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:48.800]   Jason care you go there you go. I like your thinking and we win
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:59.000]   There's three minutes of 25 seconds of your life you'll never get back
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:08.600]   Network time wasters my final time. Hey, that's pretty good. I ranked 11,853 out of 39,449 players
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:14.920]   So then they give you the record time in the tour to Twitter is five seconds
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:20.580]   Map lap six seconds, but see I think next time I'll do better next time you'll be way faster because
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.840]   You've got it down now. I didn't even know what the rules were at first
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.620]   Figure out what the hell I was doing. I'm amazed I
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.120]   Like incorporated all these other services, you know like Twitter and last FM, you know, these were these are their competitors
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.520]   Essentially and they're promoting them. I think that's great
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   Well what my initial concern with Twitter is I thought that I would be tweeting whatever I said. Yeah, it wasn't clear
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   So it's just a phony Twitter
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.200]   It was fun. I like that
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:56.840]   Now time Jean it's Gina Trapani for your tip of the
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:05.120]   Quick tip if you are logged into Facebook, but you don't love going to sites like Yelp or life hacker different places where it says
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.400]   Your friend Leo has like this
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.200]   If that kind of creeps you out a little bit there is a Google Chrome extension
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.600]   It is called Facebook disconnect and I think this is kind of funny
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.120]   This extension was developed by an engineer at Google who works on the chromium project
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.480]   But this is this this extension is doesn't have anything to do with Google's not endorsed by Google
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.240]   But the like button goes away the Facebook connect everything all that stuff goes away
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:35.640]   Oh, that stuff goes away. So it doesn't say so it blocks the flow of traffic from third-party websites to Facebook
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.480]   So it's really kind of a privacy protector
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.760]   So if someone has a direct link to Facebook you will still see that it blocks those
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:47.480]   JavaScript embeds that say that list your friends faces and say they like this or instant personalization has turned on
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   So when once you install it and Leo's doing it right now
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.240]   If you go to sites that have that Facebook
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.780]   Ingrasion you won't see it. Oh, let me try it now. I love it
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:02.160]   You can try it. Go on to Yelp.com. I hate it when I go to Yelp, but it says hey Leo. How you doing?
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.040]   You know your friends. Yeah. Oh nothing nothing up at the top. I love it. It's gone
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.360]   Kind of nice. So it's kind of like a condom for Facebook
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.440]   It does it does work on Chrome
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.120]   It's a Chrome extent. You know, I really didn't plan to say that and I'm kind of regretting that I did
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.040]   Think of it as a latex sheath to protect you
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:31.020]   It gets your gets Facebook out of all your other third-party sites that you'd like to be keep you know your activity there private
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.760]   Thank you very much. That's what I'm just not blushing now
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:45.960]   I just I just saw a tweet that the person doing the Canadian suit or involved his name John Newton and it's the P2P net
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:51.320]   Is his case and so he just tweeted oh we're talking about the case his case on there
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:58.600]   And I look at his feed and I see this from four hours ago Google Android a little bit open source quote sort of like a partial circumcision
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.080]   Gina that's the theme of the day
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:08.440]   About penises
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:20.200]   All right, yeah, that's it will do it's Rob Houghton did it for us and because we were talking
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.740]   It's last week about wearing our slinkets
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:29.240]   Which look like Monks robes and and walking down the streets of Austin
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.760]   Humming the Glugorian chat. I'll tell you I'll just play a little bit of it
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.680]   And then I'll play the full version for you at the end of the show. How about that?
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:41.000]   It is it is dramatic it is beautiful
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.600]   it is
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.480]   Very very
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.480]   very
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.560]   You get the idea it's very good it goes on for a couple minutes and it gets very
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:23.520]   Jazzy and people have been complaining and I don't blame them about the silly music that I started this show with
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.200]   Some silly classical thing
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:32.600]   I had this notion that there would be the three of us and it was kind of like we were fugging with each other and I should do some
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:39.120]   Counterpoint and it just was a bad idea. So we'll fight a better theme and this might be this might be ending
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.800]   Very cloudy though the classical theme it was the idea was Google in the cloud. That's exactly right
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.520]   You introduced it is like not just about Google with the cloud to them. I think it works the problem with theme music
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.840]   He's unless you use real music. It all sounds like bad local news
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:01.040]   And now the action news team
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:07.040]   Gina Trapani with sports Jeff Jarvis with the weather and Kevin Purdy with the news
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:15.080]   Does it it's feeling very anchor man right now. Yeah, screw you San Diego
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.320]   No, I wasn't quite like that
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:22.160]   Anyway, stay classy. I'm gonna do my best
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:30.240]   Well, that's it for our best of this week in Google. Hope you've enjoyed it. I hope you're enjoying your holidays
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:36.680]   I hope Jeff and Gina are enjoying their Chipotle bowls right as we speak right now because they're getting a week off
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.720]   We'll be back next week though with all new material for for you from this week in Google in the cloud
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:50.080]   I'm Leo LaPorte have a happy happy happy holiday and we'll see you in 2011. Cheers everyone. Bye. Bye
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:09.540]   I have a few tweets people telling each potley barber colors made from beef. It does taste
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:14.280]   It's barbecue. It looks like pulled pork, but yeah, I've never had that
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.880]   Yeah, I usually I usually go for the chicken mistakes pretty good, too
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.600]   Well, I didn't know I just that's not the most exotic. I wish I should have asked you for consultant. Oh
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.360]   This won't be your last burrito bowl
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.040]   There will be more opportunities. I'm sure
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.920]   It's okay, you know, we have all these like real Mexican. Oh, yeah, by the way the selling point
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.960]   It's not owned by McDonald's anymore
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.120]   right
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.120]   There you go
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   Well, oh dear
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:52.120]   There's Chipotle everywhere. I love twig
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:56.440]   It's such a vision
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.640]   All right, CBS CBS this ain't
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:04.500]   No, it's getting less so all the time and people say oh, we don't want you to move to that new building because you'll get all
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.200]   Professional I say no no, it's true if you're not
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.960]   Although there's a rumor which we will talk about
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:17.360]   But first but first let me begin the program
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.000]   And then we should save all the good all this good stuff for the show
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.820]   You know actually this that is quite good. There's something about it. Yeah, it probably puts something in it. I
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:35.680]   Think it's beef
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.000]   Where's the beef?
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.640]   It's a crack burrito. Yeah, no, I can say how you get addicted to that. That's quite good
