[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey as the week off, but there's lots of news from Google Cloud next Jeff Jarvis will help
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.320]   Parson all for us from the City University of New York and our open web guru Kevin Marks is here. We'll also talk about Google's quarterly results
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.040]   Facebook's disappointing results a whole lot more this week in Google is next
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.120]   Netcast you love from people you trust
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:41.560]   This is Twig bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly C A C H E F L Y dot com
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.840]   This is Twig this week in Google episode
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.200]   466 recorded Wednesday July 25th 2018
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.000]   It's been nicked. I'm Vastaden this week in Google has brought to you by rocket mortgage by quick and loans
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.480]   Introducing rate shield approval if you're in the market to buy a home rate shield approval locks up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.960]   It's a real game changer learn more and get started at rocket mortgage comm slash twig
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.840]   It's time for twig this week in Google the show where we talk about the latest news from the Google verse
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.560]   Which includes the Facebook first the Twitter verse the obverse in the reverse here
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.620]   He is all the way from New York, New York
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.280]   the town night professor of journalism at the University of City University of New York Graduate School of
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.200]   Craig Newmark
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.840]   journalism
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.960]   Jeff Jarvis without my cheat sheet. I don't really hey
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.080]   Good to see you great to see you there
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.240]   It is the letter top professor for journalistic innovation of the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York and
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.680]   Direct of the town I'd set it for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism in the City of New York
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.160]   Boggart buzz machine calm at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter and as I always take a host of this week in Google you say that I
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.480]   Do constantly I'm flattered
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.440]   That's very nice. Thank you. I'm glad that that's a good something to your kid my bio. Yes nearby
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.120]   Oh, yes, it is also with us all the way from
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.760]   Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.600]   Formerly Yorkshire. I don't know. It's in a sure. He's in a sure somewhere Kevin Marks of the indie web. Hey Kevin
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.360]   Hey there nice to see you. It's been a while. It's been a long time and I'm glad that we could get you
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   To a filling for Stacy. She's actually oddly enough at Google next just up the road a piece
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.920]   But she's busy where Sundar spoke
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.000]   Was that unexpected a cloud next? Yeah, that's what they said. He says yeah
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.160]   He's the CEO of Google. He seems like it's just up the road a piece. It shouldn't be that weird that he showed up
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.600]   Yeah
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.920]   He says we're and he said this I feels like he said this at Google I/O
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.880]   I think so too we're at an inflection point in the in as an industry with AI
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.800]   Just a few years in we've seen some incredible use cases especially in health care he was talking about I guess
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.360]   I gather according to the story from the street a
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.320]   Google built algorithm that could detect detect heart attack or stroke risk
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.880]   Through retinal scans. This is this is was this lively or this is one of the Google health
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.080]   moonshots
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   He also
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.680]   Unveiled and slew of new AI technologies
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.840]   across Google Cloud and G Suite
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.840]   I
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.320]   Forget can you can use G Suite right Jeff? It's just that you can't merge your G Suite account with your good regular
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.080]   Yeah, I'm on all I'm absolutely on G Suite
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.360]   That's how I have my email everything it just means that they causes me hell but I'm there
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.440]   Yep, they actually could some good news if you've wanted to use Google storage as a business without using G Suite
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.440]   They now have unbundled that so that's good news
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.360]   Surprise that was thought I didn't know that was yeah, okay, it's all these years. Yeah, well, that's good
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.660]   Yeah, that you had to buy both. Yeah, yeah
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.360]   They're gonna add some I think what's really interesting is the
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:24.840]   maturation of Google's office effectively office suite on the cloud and how it is now getting closer and closer to
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:32.280]   Kind of a mainstream desktop office suite for instance. They're gonna use the Google AI to do grammar
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.280]   Now there's that but there's the story by the way the Carson said just pull it up on how you can get Google Drive storage without getting Google
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.040]   Sweet, so that's good news, but they're doing in fact if I were Grammarly
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.680]   I'd be a little nervous about this because everybody who uses
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.480]   the Google
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.160]   suite of office tools well I gather get
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.880]   Grammar underlining now in their thing
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.240]   That's four million people use the G
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.920]   Let's see Google infuses more AI into G Suite
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.680]   Several new capabilities
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:20.280]   Features focus on reading writing and meetings on the writing front smart reply in Hangouts chat that's good I
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.640]   Use Hangouts still because I'm a Google Fi customer
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.960]   So you can get quick replies in your chat room. I haven't seen it yet, but I gather we'll get it soon
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   I
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.840]   Anybody use smart replies to use it in your Gmail Jeff. Oh all the time you do all the time. Yeah, it's pretty good
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   Every time I do it
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.160]   Feel like I'm gonna be found out I
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.200]   Don't care about me. I got that reply last week Jeff
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.480]   But I you know that's gonna be happening more and more and more one of the story in the rundown is that is that Google's going to bring its
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.400]   the AI
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   human voiced
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.560]   Foolier people into their call centers. Oh this is this Google duplex thing
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.000]   Yeah, so they're gonna start they're gonna start it money that the call centers
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.120]   Which means it's always been there to some extent you always deal with the stupid voice mail jail
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   But presumably this before better well, I you know, it's pretty clear when you use chat
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.440]   And that's how Google and a lot of companies want you to interact at least a first line interaction that that's a bot
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.800]   Hi, that's David. What can I do for you today? It's clearly not David
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.600]   Right, right. Yes, and then you see you can actually sense the handoff. Yeah, yes robot David
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.720]   But then you can stay then there then after a little after some interaction
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   Then I think sometimes there's a handoff because you can kind of feel like oh David just became sentient
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.480]   Yeah, that could be a bad thing
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.920]   What else new investigation tool for G Suite security center?
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.480]   I don't know what that even means helps admins remediate threats
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.200]   voice commands and hang out meet hardware I
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:11.640]   Think the grammar is a is a beta thing that you can sign up for that you have to this an early adopter program
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.240]   grammar suggestions in Google Docs
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.600]   And they've done these things before this way for those already isn't that I remember one a while from probably
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.320]   Eight years ago that when they were trying to do this
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.840]   Google Google suggest or something where you started typing
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.560]   That sounds familiar. Yeah
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:38.120]   So I mean I mean that was a bit mark of Cheney it was it was amusing in that it would keep all the competing famous sentences
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.560]   Things right like the religious texts
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.840]   That Google translate was off right. Yes, so
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.680]   So if you typed and I think they've fixed some of this
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.900]   But if you typed nonsense in and one example was dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog and then had it translate to
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.240]   Maori
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:05.160]   From Mary or from Maori into English. It would give you it looked like chapter and verse from the Bible
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.680]   It looked like
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.320]   Revelation who the hell discovered this how did I ask a question?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.240]   But I I posited that it might be mark of chains because it did feel like that
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Like snippets more subtle than mark of chains, but it's in a similar
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.120]   Similar issue the discussion in there was basically saying
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.800]   They don't have many parallel texts and so they will pick up
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.000]   Staff that was in the text they have used it
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.600]   I remember when they first put out Google translate they've used a lot of EU texts because there's parallel text there
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.560]   And they've been there sort of business. See but they would if you put in Blair it would say Sarkozy
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   I
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.840]   To England the Prime Minister France
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.480]   By name and there was a bunch of you could make it do things like that before and it's a challenge all these things the other thing that they said in there is that
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.160]   What they try and do they have two training sets? They have a training set of parallel text
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.440]   Which is to try and find correspondences?
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.880]   We also have a large training set in the target language where they try and find coherence
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.080]   That makes sense to the sentence. So if you give it nonsense
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.920]   It will try and generate the most coherent thing it can make from the nonsense rather than giving you nonsense back
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.720]   Right, which is which is a change from the previous previous behavior was we didn't know what was going on
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.000]   It would just pass the text through right which would be the right translation of dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog dog
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.640]   Or egg egg egg egg egg egg egg egg egg egg egg egg
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.640]   And I know to me this did not bother me this seemed to bother motherboard. They wrote the story
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.760]   I if you pass something nonsense
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.920]   All bets are off
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.720]   But the thing is you don't know if you don't speak the language you don't know when it's doing something a bit like that
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.240]   right the chat the difficulty with a lot of this AI stuff is
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:58.480]   When you move outside the space that it's been trained on weird things happen and so there was a similar thing a while back where
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:07.640]   Because again parallel text from because a lot of the parallel text in Arabic were translated by the State Department of people like that
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.480]   it would
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.000]   Give very war-like and inflammatory things
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.760]   Because they've been trying to because the texts were translated from the you know
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.160]   The kind of rants and things like that they had
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.520]   Whereas if you get classical Arab literature and give you all translations of things like that
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.440]   And it's and that it is a hard problem because it's hard to know in translation is a deep hard problem for humans
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.680]   and you can for your machines the machines have got better but
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   You don't know
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.160]   Nobody actually understands what's going on inside these things
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.560]   They're building some kind of intermediate representation, but it's not something you can inspect easily
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.280]   You know when they especially visually we got the deep dream stuff and spooky many eye dogs in trees and all that nonsense
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.440]   And that's and that's part because a lot of the training sets there
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.240]   But the original training set that a lot of the AI image recognition stuff was done
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.960]   Was very highly populated with pictures of dogs and different breeds of dogs
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.400]   Because that was one of the things they were trying to test it on and so if it
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:16.080]   It started seeing dog faces everywhere because it had a lot of dog faces in the training set and it's similar things with you know as as they
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.520]   do more of this
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.640]   The the worry about what you're training on gets get stronger
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.360]   There was a great thing by Pete Warden on this. You know if you have people or the ones you know
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.600]   He's he's one of the guys at Google AI who works in dev relations
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.320]   He's he's he's English too. So I've obviously connection with him
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.600]   But he's he's written some great stuff about this and one of the things he said was
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.720]   If you're doing academic AI you spend all your time thinking about models and structure and if you're doing practical real world
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.240]   I spent all your time worrying about your datasets and are they clean enough?
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.640]   And are they doing the right thing and can you tighten them up and do better things with them?
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:01.680]   I'll see I can find the piece but it's he's got a an article on medium from a couple years back called tensor flow for poets
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.960]   How did so I don't you know I'm not sure exactly I guess this would be a good way to
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:15.640]   I'm it's not writing poetry. I don't know what it's like. It's like it's like during the course. Yeah. Yeah physics for poets
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.560]   Got it got it got it got it. So it's for non technical people. Yes, yeah
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.920]   Yeah, I find the one I was thinking about I wish I put it output in the tavern
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.040]   What image classifiers can do about unknown objects
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.880]   I've met that one. That's a new one is blog. Yeah
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.360]   What the one I was to down from this why you need to improve your training day to do it. Yeah
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.620]   It's nice that there's they've got somebody a
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.000]   Human talking about this
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Yeah
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.700]   This is good. So I recommend this is Pete Pete warden.com
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.480]   P T E W a R D and we will try to get him on that would be you should get him on
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.720]   He's he's he's allowed to speak for Google. He does dev relations on a machine learning and things. He'd be a great guest
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:15.320]   Make a note of that Carson be fun to because honestly, I feel like often when we talk about these issues we talk from a
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.480]   ignorant point of view and
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.360]   Which why I'm glad to get somebody like you Kevin on and and who could set us straight?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:30.480]   About things like this translation is something well, I'm somewhat you're you're more you're more technical and I am and you work to Google
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.560]   So you know some people I
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.800]   Didn't didn't bother me that we were getting Bible verses
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.880]   but it did bother some people and
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.360]   Agagagagagagagagagagagag translated from Somali to English
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.720]   Comes out as the name of the Lord was written in the Hebrew language. It was written in the language of the Hebrew nation
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.120]   Wow, that's a that's a kind of a stretch. Yeah, yeah
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.520]   It shouldn't it probably shouldn't do that I
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.000]   Think it's harmless, but it shouldn't do that
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.420]   Well, it's not harmless in that you don't know what else is going on
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.640]   Right, you could be giving it perfectly reasonable text and still get due to which is the problem with AI is
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.560]   Or as a rule and it's and it's about how can you possibly audit the performance right people have about auditing the algorithms
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.560]   That's that's ludicrous
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.040]   Audit the the output but when you get that kind of that's what scares me is you think you know
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.000]   You know who would think to put in a go go go go go go all of the output right?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.520]   Well people have done that they put in stuff like that to make it be to do Google speech to the drum machine so
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.880]   And to try and get different
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.680]   like accent different language than things but that is a that's a this is a very strict, you know
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.680]   This is a very strange problem and it's
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.760]   and
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.080]   It's a it's a big problem with a lot of this AI stuff is you don't always know what's gonna come out
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.560]   But soon and you don't have a good understanding. There's no there's no straightforward way of understanding
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.240]   what the shape of
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.760]   The world inside it is for a lot of these problems, right?
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:06.160]   You're basically saying you're basically giving it you but normally give it a training set and what you want things to look like and
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.000]   Get it to correlate those and then you give it a test set that's that's
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.360]   Similar to the training set for distinct and see what it does with that, but there's less of a
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.640]   It's less of a likelihood of you to give it some strange noise now
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.520]   There are some there are some training models where they have what they call an adversarial AI
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.000]   We have another AI who's trying to find the cracks in the first one. That's where they've done things like
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.760]   come up with images that fall the
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.440]   Large set of a eyes that will be trained on image net for example
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.840]   So you can you can change a few things and it'll think a gun is a turtle or things like that
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   Because you're you'll fuck you
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.080]   It's it's hard to understand you have to treat these things as black boxes and test them empirically
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.400]   And it's it's very hard to do you to do that when you've only got a known set of trains
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   And so that that essay by Pete is very good on this. It's basically saying the most significant thing you can do is improve your
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.480]   improve your data and
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.240]   Have a good feel for the data you're feeding it and what you're trying to feed it
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.080]   and
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.280]   One of his anecdotes in there was when he was putting up they ended up by hand training it with
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.720]   Reacting to two million images between the team of six of them
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.880]   Because they couldn't get they couldn't find a way to get people to do that for them
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.000]   So it brings us back to
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.600]   Pachai's comments at Google Cloud next this week. Are we at an inflection point? It feels like we're really
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.040]   still pretty primitive
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.040]   um
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.800]   Well, you know Google has been wanting to do this for a very long time and then they're better than
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.440]   almost anyone else so
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:57.640]   But the question is how does it work in domains where the problem isn't well defined and you you know so in other words if you're trying to find
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.480]   Heart problems or or
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:08.520]   That's because that's a more it's just the same thing as I guess is a speech dictation in a constrained a more constrained environment
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.800]   Does a better job than in a kind of a general example that people raise using these days when it comes to dealing with
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.720]   Fake news and Harris meant to those kinds of things
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.680]   At a scale where they're killing a million fake accounts a day
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.800]   then
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.240]   You know this has to this those are those are subtle nuanced things to try to figure out
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.200]   No, I mean that was that what that was that one of the other part from the obvious shocking things like a bird said last week
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.520]   The other one said was oh, yes, we're using a eyes to do this
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.680]   We're using a eyes to lead lead our humans in the right direction was like well that seems like a bad idea
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.960]   It's like okay
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.760]   but also, you know, they've already got a problem that they're trying to
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.480]   understand nuanced communication with
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.040]   minimum wage people who have a
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:05.000]   Evaluate per hour target and then they're feeding the results of that into an AI and then you set to create a feedback loop to those people
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.680]   so if you if you if you if you can find an
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:17.040]   Agagact type attack on Facebook you can you can do the kind of influence that we've already seen we and that is what the
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:24.120]   That was what they were blind to from the you know, Russian exploit networks, which basically system actually looked at this and said okay
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.900]   Let's experiment with the ages this and see what we can do to amplify things if our goal is to amplify things
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:35.440]   Noisy way and cause chaos rather than game the advertising system, which is what Facebook was optimizing for
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:42.040]   Then it's a is a very different problem. So you think so I'm a little cynical as
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.680]   Jeff will vouch for about mark and Facebook
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:52.000]   Do you think that they actually believe AI is the solution for this or they just know that like the word blockchain
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.440]   AI is a good thing to it's like ferried us to sprinkle on any solution I
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.480]   Think they believe it so they so I don't know which is worse
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.400]   cynical marketing tech speech or
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   Believing something this paid well
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.080]   They also want to believe it desperately because I so I wrote a piece this week about you know
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.360]   I finally had to come down on the you know because I
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   Full disclosure I accepted money in my school for Facebook. I received no money myself
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.040]   I'm offended to Facebook, but because I I had to
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.800]   Say what I thought about about the info war stuff and my view strongly is that info wars should go down
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:33.520]   But it's really hard to come up with a rule set. Yeah, we talked about last week
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.360]   What exactly what is the rule you call it finding the line and I quoted I quoted you in that piece?
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.240]   because
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:48.160]   Zuckerberg's line was that it imminent cause of violence and you said no harm is the
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   Is the right way to put the line and I agree with that but harm is hard to define right?
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:01.720]   But what if you now like Jones says that that somebody should if he mimes taking a shot at Robert Mueller
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   That strikes me as a threat of harm. Yeah, clearly the rules are bad
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.720]   crosses that line for sure to me yes and
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.080]   If by the way and one of the reasons I kind of know this is
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   You know if you get threats on Twitter as my daughter did many years ago
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.200]   The first thing the police will say is do you feel?
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:29.440]   Endangered you feel and at risk of bodily harm from this threat if you do not then it doesn't rise
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.040]   To the cause it's not a cost for action if you do
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:40.760]   Then they can proceed and they in fact we a local petaluma detective got a warrent got the IP address from Twitter
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:48.040]   Then went to the internet service provider got a warrant in Chicago tracked down the person who'd made a violent threat against my daughter
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.200]   Who was probably 15 or 14 at the time is it was a kid?
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:59.560]   And but the police knocked on his door and because it was a threat of harm. There was a physical risk of harm
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.360]   So that's why I kind of I think that's the legal standard at least it was in this case
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.600]   You can't and that's the whole First Amendment thing shouting
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.120]   Right the fire is over the wall but Facebook can make its own decisions
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.600]   You know what's a face book to do whatever watch week, right?
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.880]   But you can't prosecute somebody unless right exactly yeah, but that's like a good at least that's a minimum
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:28.840]   That's at the very minimum something Facebook should have at least that as it's well certainly certainly the threats to individuals and harassment individuals
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.280]   Yes, I think that's easy and that's going down same for Twitter
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.080]   Even if we didn't say that lab appointing a gun and saying Robert Mueller
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.320]   That's so but so the argument that the zuck makes here and
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.440]   And I try to argue back here. I and I probably an argument I would have made five years ago is free speech is
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.360]   More different opinions this and that the more on a bit of backwards in the in the
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:57.280]   Speech that's for sure nothing. He's gonna listen to me, but I said to him in the piece mark. You're not responsible for free speech
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:05.360]   The that doesn't fall to you. Yeah, the Alex Jones has plenty of places where he can congregate with his cockroaches
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.340]   He doesn't need Facebook to do that. You don't need a new
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.040]   Facilitate that yes. Yeah, and they've got a break out of that idea
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:18.680]   I think it's a question he the same thing with the holocaust deniers. He said well, I don't know I don't understand their intent
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   I don't think they're intentionally
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:30.040]   Denying they're so scared of having to make rules that are hard to enforce that require people and expense that are gonna get them in trouble
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.280]   with certain, you know trolls we're gonna go after them, but you know
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.680]   Facebook you're you're the you're there chump now
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:45.760]   It's the part of the problem is part of the problem that social media and the amplification effect of social media has flipped on its head the old
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:54.560]   Rule that the best that that free speech doesn't help nazis. It helps you get rid of nazis that used to be the rule
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.680]   Yes, that's a good point. You know the the more speech is better rule when we have
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.760]   No end of a speech possible
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.680]   You know, I don't know the hard thing is again
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.800]   We keep paying attention to the bad end of the cycle and trying to play whack a mole with that
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.200]   We need better systems to just ignore the a-holes
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:22.840]   The underlying problem is that the systems are optimized for engagement right and it amplifies the a-holes
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.160]   You know crying for a crowded theater is a great way to get engagement right so
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.680]   Causing stampedes in the digital world is is a great way to have that too
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.640]   And because of that
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:40.840]   They've poisoned the broader discourse too because that is now the editorial agenda is say something controversial
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:47.240]   That will get you a hate share so that we get the traffic we need and that's that is the sort of underlying
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.640]   Problem with this and the challenge is coming up with ways to do this that
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.480]   Something to optimize for that isn't that
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   That is that is you know, how do you optimize for reason discourse?
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.760]   What how do you apply? You know the the properian rule of do not tolerate intolerable?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   What do you make of Maureen Sullivan's?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.160]   Washington Post
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.800]   Op-ed piece and when she said Mark Zuckerberg is a horror show, but there's a glimmer of truth hidden in his latest blunder
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.960]   She says to follow
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.920]   She this is the Margaret Sullivan who used to be the media ombudsman at the New York Times times right who was who was
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:29.480]   So good in that job that they discontinued it after she left they couldn't find anybody one more, but she didn't work out
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.080]   So yeah
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.280]   To follow Mark Zuckerberg's utterances she writes is to constantly cringe
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:43.040]   But I think horror show was a little strong in the headline. Yeah, well, she might not even have written that headline
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.680]   So I probably shouldn't have should have read that
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.600]   but
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.480]   So her her point
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.840]   What is her point somebody better explain it to me because I know crap
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:06.320]   I think her point is what I just said, which is the best way that free speech helps you fight Nazis doesn't promote Nazis
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   It helps you fight Nazis
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:16.280]   She said maybe imagine if instead of taking it down Facebook a pen a prominent disclaimer atop the holocaust denial page
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.920]   Why spread censorship and chasing down every falsehood
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.840]   ought to be acknowledged as bad ideas rights morning. Yes, I agree with them
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:35.360]   Nonetheless, it's already marginalized voices that are likely silenced by that point of view
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.520]   That's true if it's too automated, but at some point
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:46.800]   Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg himself has the full freedom to decide what is acceptable on the platform that he built right and
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.320]   And you know that he when he talks about free speech, which again
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   I would have done five years ago too
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.600]   but
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.600]   The internet is not controllable
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.760]   Facebook is by you mark, right?
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.080]   So people some people are begging you to control that some people are saying no stay away
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.120]   You can't make any judgement you shouldn't be doing this, you know
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:12.600]   And even worse is Kevin says maybe Facebook is actually doing the opposite simply in its normal operation
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.400]   By amplifying the most objectionable speech because edit that
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.960]   produces engagement that's its algorithm. It's optimized. That's why I think that that even even moving past clickbait and
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.400]   Attention as the metric to try to move to meaningful interactions between people
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:36.280]   I think that's gonna move from clickbait to comment bait and and so the metrics still aren't right and the metrics are too easy to game
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.640]   The point here is it's not so much that Facebook is choosing to do this
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.760]   It's that the bad guys recognize the weakness and and exploited to the fullest
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.280]   so
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.880]   Following that news Facebook had its quarterly
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.400]   Results today just minutes ago stock tumbled
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:03.120]   But it's as usual and this is why I we often don't talk about financial markets because it's not necessarily correlated
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.800]   to anything we talk about on the show, but they missed their
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:16.240]   expectations so revenue wasn't that revenue was down it just wasn't as up as much as people had thought by a
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.240]   small amount frankly
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.520]   13.23 billion in revenue
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.280]   instead of 13.3 billion oh
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:29.840]   Monthly active users 2.23 billion. That's just a astounding number instead of 2.25
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.560]   daily active users
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:39.000]   1.47 billion daily active users and that was a little lower than the growth
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.280]   It's not that it didn't grow again. It grew it just didn't grow quite as much. They're not dying
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.560]   But you know they they they passed the point where they can grow they're running out of humans
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.660]   They're running out of people one and a half billion people. That's a lot of people
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.800]   Yeah, that's why they that's why they're putting satellites up to get internet access
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.480]   Advertising revenue up 42%
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.720]   year over year to 13 billion dollars
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.080]   91% of
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:17.840]   advertising revenue from mobile so I've said this every quarter for the last few years the real question about
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:25.000]   Facebook was could they make the turn going from desktop revenue lore to mobile revenue and yes the answer is yes
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.200]   91% now the question is why what they should just get rid of desktop
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.000]   Wow
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.360]   Pretty much have what I've complained, you know two years ago when I complained about some UI thing just with people
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.840]   I know who work there on the desktop is it we don't you know, they don't care. Yeah, they don't care
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.600]   It's it's amazing how the worm is turned or whatever it is. It's not the way it's not a worm exactly
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.260]   It's amazing unless it's a worm from the dune
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.520]   landscape
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.240]   It's amazing to have the giant worm has turned
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:09.200]   It mobile is very successful. Look Facebook successful the stock price going down does not reflect a lack of success in fact
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.160]   If I were a trader, I would say that's a buy signal right now. Go go out and get it
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:20.000]   Alphabet let's talk about their results. Oh, yeah, one whole thing. There's there's a bug on Facebook
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.840]   So driving me nuts the last week. Yeah since the weekend. So I have tweets go you wouldn't know this deal because you know, you you've you've gone back in time
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.600]   Um, but I have tweets that go automatically from twitter to facebook
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.760]   Oh, yeah, I've heard of that
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.160]   if you're retweeting something or your
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.720]   The thing you're attached that is attached to your tweet often isn't coming across
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.960]   So you have some statement what a surprise
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.240]   Ha ha ha and then that's all that's the whole tweet people saying are you nuts? What's going on here?
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.960]   There's no context to that on facebook
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.440]   So I go into facebook and I kill those
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.800]   You're saying the link from twitter is not you know why because facebook doesn't want any outbound links on no, it's a bread
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.840]   Something's broken. It's just right. It could also be a photo
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.240]   So you're reacting to something in a tweet
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.520]   Yeah, and the thing the the the the the the
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.080]   Artifact that you're reacting to doesn't go across
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.440]   So if you're listening facebook you fix that please or twitter
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:22.320]   It could be because twitter changed something but facebook nonetheless you could also jeff do it by hand with something like if this than that
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.200]   Make but the challenge is it's a reply context. You're twitter doesn't even get this right in moments
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.000]   So right or um, what do they call it highlights?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.480]   So they'll display something in highlights and it's like here's this tweet that lots of people retweeting is like
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.640]   It's very frustrating. I think that's responding to something else with a photo in it
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.040]   And I have no idea why this one is so happy
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.480]   The overall feeling when I read twitter that I've had a stroke and that suddenly
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.240]   A comprehensible world has become completely incomprehensible
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.400]   But that's just that's just that's just twitter in the context moving really quickly with a
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.600]   Because moving or disappearing or just disappearing
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.080]   There's no context at all
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.000]   No, but you start they start with a joke formula and then then that becomes mutated into something else you got a show thread all the time
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.120]   And then you have some joke for with it. It's like
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.880]   Uh, I don't understand why this is funny because it's it's a new day. Diverse. That's the meme of the moment
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.840]   Kevin you stay up with it try to keep up with us
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   Yeah, I'm
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.720]   So I'm sorry I derailed us there you were about to sit on google. Uh, who cares?
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.960]   All right
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.080]   All right, we'll do it x y abc.xyz one of the best by the way
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.440]   I'm downloading the latest chrome
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:42.880]   Let's see uh chrome. Oh, I don't know. Maybe uh, maybe I won't it's 67
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.960]   I think it's with 69
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.320]   That chrome is going to start when you go to a site that's not secure
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.880]   saying danger danger will robinson insecure site
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.720]   What do you think about that web standards guy?
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.400]   If you're not https you're dangerous
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.320]   It didn't say dangerous. It says insecure. It's going to be read in a couple of months
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.800]   Well, it's it's already read when you when you click on the lie
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.320]   It says you know, I feel you got a my site. So the connection to the site is not secure
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.840]   Oh, is that which one a pig is a piggy piggyden bottom us?
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.560]   Okay
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:26.800]   Does not have hdps because yes a piggy you know you are you're on blogger. I thought
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.040]   I was on blog. Well, it's still there. But but i've been kidding marks. So
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.200]   So now it says you can see it's kind of hard to see but it says not secure up here
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.960]   Which should be secure. That's that's on blogger. It's on blogger, but it's not secure and
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.080]   Right now. It's not kevin's fault
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.760]   And right now
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.600]   It's it's kind of benignly white same color as the rest of it
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.960]   But in a couple of months this fall it's going to be a bright red not secure
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.080]   That to me is shouting fire in a crowded theater
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.280]   This your connection to this site is not secure
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.680]   You should not enter any sensitive information on this site because then you don't happen
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.720]   You're going to be in an airport or going to be in a hotel or somebody's company and they're going to start blocking all of that
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.520]   Because it's insecure. Yes
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   Well, no, I mean the other thing is there's the irony is that you've got the opposite problem, which is
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.920]   Um when you're trying to connect through some damn Wi-Fi portal
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:27.280]   You need an HTTP site because it can then they can put up their crappy man in the middle thing to make you log in
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.520]   I understand their desire of hdts everywhere. I think it's a good so there's actually
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.080]   They could say this as as my thing. There's a site called never ssl.com
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.040]   Um at its entire point
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.800]   Is you put it into your address bar so that you know you've got one site that will always be hdbt
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.520]   Which means it can trigger the um hide. This is your hotel. Please enter the the code you were given a reception thing
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.400]   Oh, because any hdbs site can't can't trigger that
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.360]   Oh, wow, that's a huge problem. I didn't know that
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.120]   Yeah, and so this this is this is where they're changing now. Oh, so are you talking about captive portals?
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.960]   Yes
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   So apple has a work around
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:13.120]   On they're evil to begin with but everybody uses them. That's where you have to do a login before you can use the internet apple
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.040]   Just uh senses a captive portal and sends you to an apple site. Well, that's still
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:24.240]   Yeah, good good. Um, google does that on android as well. Yeah, that was that will still work because they've got an apple site
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.760]   They're doing a redirect that is actually key. Yeah, um, so um, I think a couple of years ago
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:35.600]   That site went down and um all the max and i um, ios has lost their minds for a couple of hours
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.680]   Well, and also my wife who's notoriously, uh, she moves fast. She's impatient never waits long enough for the captive portal to pop up
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:50.560]   She says just the site's not coming up. So I go to go to I think it's is it captive dot apple dot com something like that
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:57.120]   But it never SSL you can remember never ssl. I'll tell you that from now on that will that will be the place to go
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.040]   Okay, that's what that was from the portal. Yeah, if you go to captive dot apple dot com, it's actually a very happy site
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.440]   You just get one word success
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.040]   That's a that's a happy site on the internet success
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.600]   I don't know
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   I'm succeeding
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.680]   Or never ssl.com this site will never use so
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:27.760]   It is a good thing to have secure sites. It really is it causes problems with captive portals, but they're broken to begin with
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.800]   Yes, we should get rid of captive portals. I thought would be a better
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.400]   Better way to do that. Is there a reasonable way to do that?
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.680]   Reason where to do that is to post the password to your Wi-Fi on the wall on the piece of paper
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:46.400]   Yeah, you know, but then I can't get you but then I can't get you to agree to all my terms and capture your your email address
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.720]   Well, that's illegal now anyway. So shut up. It's a legal in california and europe. So wait a minute what?
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:56.160]   Yeah, they can't ask you to agree to their terms of service to use the internet
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   No, of course, because you're using their internet
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.640]   their access
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.160]   Legal
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.200]   They are they asked to track you and put a profile a lot of time right so most a lot of them are illegal
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.920]   You know because they're tracking so many of these crappy portals are in retail as time as they say give me your email address before you continue
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.720]   Yeah, that is a GDPR violation. It's a california law. Whatever. It's called violation, right?
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.200]   And for that law is not an effect until 2020
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:28.320]   So you have a shame. Yeah, I agree because I'm waiting for the trunk sites to ban people in california
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.000]   times I can't read from here anymore. Um, so when they do that to LA that'll be even better
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.800]   Mind you that's assuming they lost that long. So they never so this was all because of GDPR
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.560]   They never face tons. Yeah, no, it's not not just
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.720]   trunk papers
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.560]   It's more. Yeah, I tried to get a lot of places when I was in europe couldn't get couldn't get in
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.200]   Oh, I thought that that was just carpal tunnel syndrome from having to like okay, okay, okay
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   browser cookies thing
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.360]   Beyond that now to be on browse now. Will you agree to our new rules? We agree
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.200]   This universal universe is in all perpetuity. Okay
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:11.920]   Thank you europe so uh, kevin just imagine the chatroom the text which says unfortunately
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.880]   Our website is currently unavailable in most european countries. We are engaged on the issue
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:23.760]   This is why I assumed oh they're gonna try to fix it and committed to looking at options and support our full range of digital offerings to the eu market

[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:49.360]   They have a degree and continue and you say decline and visit plaintext like you get this really responsive page. Oh nice
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.080]   That's a good technical solution
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.000]   The web as it used to wow that's also see what those like yeah, I'll have to go to europe
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.840]   I'm putting the links in the chat. I'm not sure if they face to a trick of you, but this is what I get oh htts
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.880]   Texts dot npr.org

[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.520]   I think I remember reading about this look how look how fine this looks. It's like a gopher site
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.160]   It was it's pretty snappy as well. Oh, yeah loaded really quick because there's nothing but text
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.800]   Now if I if I click the link
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.200]   Oh, it does it continues
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.240]   Look at that no images no audio
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.280]   The uh the links are in blue with an underline. I love that
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.800]   Are followed links in mauve and purple
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.200]   Oh, yeah, this is old school. Oh, look at that. Look at that. That's beautiful
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.560]   Man, I wish the web were still like that sometimes
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.480]   Yeah, can we write a plug in uh, kevin that does this
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:58.480]   Well, you can just disable javascript and css, but it wouldn't use links that will make things look bad
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:04.320]   There is are there any gopher sites still alive. Oh, yeah, there's tons there are oh, yeah
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.520]   It's much that that part of the web is still much like it always
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.240]   I wish finger hadn't gone away to be honest with you
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.640]   Yeah, I'm sure there was good security reasons why finger it was a bad idea, but
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.680]   We have to know someone's email address. Yeah. Yeah
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.960]   Yeah, it's good. You just finger them and then they would they would they would cough
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:31.920]   It's cold, please. Um, I turn into poking. Yeah
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:38.000]   Uh, this is this is what I've been kind of it. This is a project. I've been kind of interested in it's called browsh
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.320]   It's a modern text. Oh, that's kind of fun. Yes. Yeah, unfortunately you have to have web kit on your
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.400]   machine because basically it's using it it pulls the it gets web kit to render it
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.640]   And then it turns into text which is hysterical
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.320]   Um
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.480]   Text dot brow dot
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:07.040]   The browsh plain text client you can use it by appending URLs
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.720]   Like this so you add
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.760]   What oh pre pending or appending?
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.320]   I do if I add this to twitter tv is it gonna work
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.400]   Yeah
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.360]   This is append your road to browsh. Yes. Yes, that's what it's saying. Uh, no, I know I got was my salad
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:31.200]   Appent. Oh, that's
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.880]   Pre oh, I was pre pending it. Of course you have to upend it. I don't know yes. Yeah
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.920]   I'm just curious what you're gonna get if you go to the text only version. No, it didn't work
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.120]   Oh, there's a slash here
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.920]   Should do I have to do htts?
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:58.560]   No, it's not it's google doesn't like me
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.200]   Anyway speaking of google g is for google speaking alphabet
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:07.520]   Investors where's the uh, where's where oh the
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:14.240]   Google's not a conventional. What is this? Where's the results? I want results. I went to abc.xyz
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.160]   Here we go
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   Is this q2 2018?
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.480]   Here it is. Yeah second quarter 2018 results
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.520]   alphabet
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:33.360]   revenues god I just I when I look at this stuff, you know, I just got this is three months we're talking
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.120]   And and this is in millions 32 billion dollars in three months
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:45.360]   It 32.6 excluding fines 32.6
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.360]   So I I guess the fines didn't affect the revenue they affected the operating income so the
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.360]   the profit
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:42:00.000]   Was only a mere 2.8 billion dollars this quarter should have been seven pointed except for those jerks jerky jerks in the EU
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.920]   That took the margin down from 24 percent to 9 percent so they only made 9 percent i'm sad
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.360]   net income
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.080]   I'm not sure how net income varies from operating income, but this is roughly the same
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.920]   So everybody was happy right this is big big bucks
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:24.800]   They don't break it down very much. I really wish people like other bets lost
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.040]   Uh more money this year 733
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.280]   I'm sorry 732 million losses for other bets
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.760]   That's way most of other bets, right
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.200]   Uh
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.080]   Those contact lenses or other bets moonshots are other bets google x is other bets
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.040]   It's not that much money
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:55.280]   Oh, they can afford to lose 732 million dollars. I wonder proportionally what the uh bell labs cost at tnt
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.000]   right
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.280]   And of course they didn't monetize for it. Well, any of that. Yeah
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:09.840]   So, uh, let's see here change from q2 year over year paid clicks on google properties went up 58
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.120]   Cost per click went down 22
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:22.400]   Uh impressions on the google network member properties up a mere 1% that's basically flat cost per impression on google network members properties
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.000]   Up 14% I'm no stock analyst, but that seems like that's all pretty good
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Yep
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.440]   You yeah
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.960]   If you make more money by charging less you're doing something right
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:42.480]   Full disclosure as I have some google shares. Oh, well, you're not promoting google
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:50.240]   I have some in my retirement because I have uh index funds. Do I still need to do I still need to
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.880]   Disclaim it. No, everybody has I mean, I'm aware of it
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:01.120]   It passes a blind trust. I think yeah, I don't manage it. I don't decide I don't say buy more google or buy less google
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.200]   I just buy uh the s&p 500 in the
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.120]   Yeah, and index funds. So I I guess
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:13.920]   In next week any more apple google amazon as they say i'm getting apple google amazon i'm getting the fangs because what are you gonna do?
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.640]   Yeah, everybody loves the fangs
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.720]   Amazon amazon which I also have has been very good to me
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.840]   uh
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.720]   And to jeff bezos who continues to be the richest man gods ever created
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:34.160]   Actually mooring Sullivan got one fact wrong. She said mark succuberk was harvard's richest graduate
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:41.600]   And then somebody pointed out uh mooring remember bill gates marker marker mooring Sullivan was the child actress
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:49.120]   In uh, oh you said neither of them graduated. So that's right. So graduates wrongs a student attendee
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.000]   I've got honorary degrees now each I think so okay, so that does does that make them graduates or just
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.560]   Um carsten who went to harvard says no honorans
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.080]   Carsten says no
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:07.680]   Uh, but carsten you did your you had to go for four years you had to live in those awful dorms
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.720]   Put up with that terrible food. You had to write up what car what carsten? What was your major english?
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:20.000]   There you go. There you go. There you go. Actually, I don't think I even uh ended up graduating with a major
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.240]   I don't I think I missed a couple of requirements
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.520]   But you see that's what I like about harvard. It's a real gentleman's university
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.480]   I will give him the degree anyway
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.040]   It worked hard. He's a nice boy
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.080]   What did you don't you have to write a senior paper or something?
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.960]   That's what I didn't do. I didn't I didn't do a senior thesis. So I graduated general studies
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.440]   Oh
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   That boy
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.560]   Yes
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.520]   Harvard light Harvard light
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.200]   What house were you in?
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.040]   Adams
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.800]   Black shirt wearing artsy house the artsy house
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.600]   All right now we've learned I you know I've worked with carsten for more than 20 years and
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:07.040]   I have now learned something I didn't know or else more likely I knew it but forgot
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.920]   Because I don't care
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.440]   No, I'm just teasing alphabets other bets. We should clarify include loon
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:22.400]   Which has finally found a customer one customer. Oh loon is going to provide internet access
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.080]   to somewhere in africa. I've forgotten which country
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:32.960]   Uh, those are the balloons the giant weather balloons that they ever uh deploy over
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.520]   Puerto Rico
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.440]   Oh, I don't know they were talking about that weren't they
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.800]   the wing autonomous drone initiatives
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.440]   Waymo other bets
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.360]   fiber
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.800]   Verily
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.720]   And chronicle which is their cyber security outfit 100,000 people
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.840]   For loon
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.600]   Yeah in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico. Oh, they did do loon in Puerto rica. Okay. Good
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.960]   So they're not yet making money on any of these, but that's okay
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.600]   Okay, that's okay. All right
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:11.200]   Uh the european fine 5.07 billion obviously had something to do it. So that's interesting that means that they paid it right
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.120]   Well, they had they had to account for it. Okay
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:21.040]   They're putting money. Yeah, they they opened an account at the dime savings and loan and put the money in there
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:26.240]   Actually, you know the even at point 1 percent that could that could add up
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.880]   Yeah, I'll take it
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.760]   Well, they move it from one offshore accounts another offshore account. It's all in Ireland. It doesn't yeah
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   It's probably Luxembourg now rather than
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:40.960]   Came in that's true. That's true. Kevin. It is kind of a way to repreat. We paid for patriate some of the money. Yeah
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:47.600]   They they do once the judgment happened. They did have that they have 90 days to end the conduct
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:56.320]   What should use the thing they tried to settle this and isn't that interesting and they didn't and this is why this is such a political act
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.360]   On on the EU's part. They don't want to they don't want to settle. They want to bring them to justice
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.680]   The settlement said that we'll stop doing all the things
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:12.640]   You know this thing the Bloomberg story is secret offer to settle. Was it I mean secret they
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.240]   What is that? I mean, I don't know it was secret so much. They you know do what you do you approach them and say
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.320]   We will change our behavior
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:29.520]   New yeah, did they say that whether they address all of the issues that the EU had let's see
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.640]   um
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   It didn't have to be that way
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.760]   Right
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:40.400]   Rights Bloomberg months earlier when the company already reeling from a 2.4 billion euro fine
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.280]   In the shopping case made quiet attempts
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.600]   But what are you gonna do announce it?
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.760]   Of course they're gonna tweet it made quiet attempts tweet it in all caps
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   But they wouldn't have been better off tweet if they wouldn't better off say we will change our way
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.920]   You're the only to do they should yeah
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.320]   To settle the probe and to do the
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.560]   It waited a year too long according to margaret of esta here
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.880]   When a company wants to settle it needs to reach out immediately after
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.840]   Getting the eus initial complaint
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.560]   That didn't happen in this case and then of course it takes the root that it has now taken
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:18.000]   So no surprises says esta here
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.800]   Hmm don't they don't I guess it doesn't say what the
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.760]   what the settlement offer was I mean if
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.160]   how does
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   Huh
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.960]   Well, they would have been here but they were willing to change behaviors. Yeah
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:40.720]   They responded. I mean they have to now do it in 90 days. How do they respond to this? What do they do they say?
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:47.440]   Okay, we'll stop bundling they'd have to stop bundling chrome in the play store in android stop requiring companies that offer
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.080]   Particularly google services version of android to from offering the un
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:58.080]   Android big deal although as you pointed out quite well quite aptly jeff last week
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:04.320]   That causes confusion in the marketplace because you don't know what you're getting am I getting a double android phone or an android android phone?
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.800]   Yeah, well, no, but also the challenge is
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:12.240]   Um that if you offer any phone with google services you have to offer all your phone to google services
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.480]   So that's the piece that they want to break
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.560]   So it means if you're if you're trying to give a parallel operating system
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.880]   um if you also ship phones that that have google's full approved version on
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.480]   Um
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.320]   That's a that's a has to go everywhere things. So that's that's one of the courses they're trying to break
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:35.680]   Um, but the the other browsers thing is is a bit weird because they can install other browsers
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.200]   um and
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.600]   You know, there is the microsoft remedy where they they require them to give them a choice browser
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.960]   And it's all time. That's as bad as the cookie the cookie announcement on the websites
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.720]   Which is also an isn't response to the EU. So greg ferro
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.440]   On sunday made actually convinced me
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.520]   That there was an issue with google's behavior that in effect
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:06.880]   They preempted any by giving away android by doing what they did they get pre-empted any competing operating system. They basically
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.520]   Made android into the monopoly that it is by by
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:18.640]   Convincing everybody samson. Okay, what's wrong with that? That's that's becoming the monopoly is not a problem
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.800]   There's nothing wrong with that
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.640]   Um, and there's there wasn't any way i'll stop anybody doing it, but but it was good for consumers. It was free it made for
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:31.760]   Well, but it's the same issue for the transition when microsoft started giving away internet explorer
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.640]   It actually killed netscape because netscape was charging
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.120]   For their browser microsoft gave away
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.800]   Who won in that case
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   Who won well netscape died
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   so consumers won
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:48.960]   Only because along comes apple and google and created competing browsers otherwise microsoft didn't
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   Exhore browser. We got a free browser
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.800]   That on his face is good for consumers. It's bad for choice
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.840]   Um, it's dumping all around it wasn't it's this is it
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.320]   This is a long standing intel did the same thing with its chips it dumped its chips
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:09.440]   And it killed competition and then this is the amazon you could argue tried to do the same thing with bookstores by undercutting bookstores
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.200]   Putting them out of business and then they can raise it to this then they get the monopoly
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.200]   They can raise it that is a long standing
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.960]   problematic and
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.840]   What is illegal behavior by a lot of companies you can't stop?
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.080]   What's google's what's google raise the price on?
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.280]   Well, eventually if you own android they can do whatever they want if
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.840]   But they haven't done it and that's
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:34.560]   To become the only competitor right now is ios and it's not much of a competitor anywhere, but the us
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:42.240]   Right, but the bit android was you know largely in response to ios and because google was very wide about being shut out of it
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.000]   That was the reason to put so i understand that but but the question is to google's
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.920]   Behavior with android it was it really to keep anybody else from entering the market against them no it was a way
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:01.680]   It was a way to come to kevin's right was a way to compete with ios it was a very clever one i understand was that but it was also
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   But didn't did they not dump?
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   Android in order to prevent competition
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.400]   No, well they they made an emphasis i wrote i posted a link to something i wrote in this in 2011 but
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.040]   They made an open source operating system, which is which is in line with google
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.800]   You know values and behavior and and makes sense to build open source infrastructure, but they've but they also
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:29.920]   Separately created this contract where it also gets access to google's proprietary stuff like the app store
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.760]   and
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.600]   chrome rather than chromium
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.880]   And you know a bunch of other things that are actually quite useful like maps
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.640]   You have to sign a contract with them and so they have to so
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.960]   In order to in order as you say as jeff said in order to get like the full
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.840]   experience of android
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   You have to you have to buy these things you have to sign a corner going to do that and initially
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.440]   Um, a lot of people built these parallel universe androids that had different stuff on the samson still does it
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.400]   Every every time you fire a samsung phone you get two copies of everything the app google one of the samson well
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:08.560]   And it's confusing as anything but um, it sounds in order if samson wants to ship the google version at all
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.640]   They can't just make their own obviously cool
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:16.320]   Tenzen texans and a lot of tizen yes tizen yeah, they were they said okay, let's try you know
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.720]   We're big enough can we build another os?
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.400]   Well, you can but you're gonna have to build and make a substantive
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.920]   subsidiary that only sells those phones and that you can't brand them samson because you have a deal with google to sell samson
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.880]   Right so they so in effect google killed it
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.040]   Yeah, well not killed it. I mean they
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:40.720]   They made it economically not viable to make ties to bring ties in any farther forward
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:45.440]   The only thing that ties ended up on was watches because it didn't violate their agreement with google
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:51.520]   Yeah, so that's what i'm saying is that google that is predatory behavior and is traditionally considered
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.120]   uh, anti-trust or trust busting or whatever it is what's the opposite of it's
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.040]   monopolistic behavior
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.200]   Trust creating or whatever. Yes. Trust creating yes
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:08.000]   So this article on your blog apayos epigany is uh called two faces of android from january
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:15.520]   Fourth 2011 and actually initially this was my argument of why i felt like google is being punished unfairly because they gave away android
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:20.480]   That's you know, that's a good thing have an open source version of the operating system and so many people as you point out
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.640]   benefited for that you called it a cambrian explosion of new android devices
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:32.320]   And it's a different market reality. We can't always use the the analogs of a scarcity based market in an abundance based market
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.040]   Yeah, no, that's true. And that's you know
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:40.160]   And i'm a big fan of open source software and it is better. You know apples had actually just the same pattern
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:45.760]   Um, it's you know, you don't really hear about it, but the the underlying part of ios is open source
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.560]   It's a free bsd for starwin. Yeah, you can you can get the code
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.920]   You can inspect those bits, but then there's a layer of stuff that that's apple only and then you have to get permission to use that part
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.400]   and google is less
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.960]   restricted than that and that's the you know, that's the major competition so
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:11.360]   Is a trade-off but they but it's the fact that it is open source means that you can do lots of interesting things with and people still do interesting things with with android
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.920]   I mean
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:19.520]   It's it's starting to show his age a bit and am i's not doing an interesting thing with android. I mean they're
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.240]   The fire platform is android
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:30.640]   Yeah, and you can even download later after the fact that google play store and get the best of both worlds and they are deadly competitors. Yeah
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:36.400]   Uh, man. I wish greg fair over here because he'd convinced me on sunday now you guys are
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.440]   I am I am like dial trump. I'm a tree. Whoever I talked to last
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:47.360]   You know what leo is both. I mean, you know, android save me Kevin
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:50.960]   Is it had a world than um, microsoft winning would have been
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.520]   Yeah, if we'd have good at times windows windows there later whatever it's called
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:59.280]   I think here in the us we don't we have a little bit skewed vision on this because
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.720]   iPhone wall it's not half it's close to half and so there really it looks like there's a very good
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.800]   reasonable choice here between android and ios and android you have all these different manufacturers it really is a
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.920]   Vibrant ecosystem. It feels a lot like mac and windows
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:19.840]   Uh, but I think in the rest of the world android is so dominant that maybe there's a different point of view
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.440]   I don't know, but you know what leo
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:27.520]   I would argue that everything all sins should be forgiven if they come out with a new pixel book
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:34.160]   I might agree with you on that. Let's talk a little bit about the data transfer project
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.280]   Yeah has health frozen over
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.800]   Does this even to see the facebook google microsoft and twitter logos
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.560]   On a page all together now. How can this be?
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.920]   We'll talk facebook connect. Yeah, we'll talk about the dtp
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.720]   And just a bit but first a word for rocket mortgage
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   Our sponsor for this episode of this week in google
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.680]   If it weren't for our sponsors, we wouldn't have a show. So thank you quick and loans
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.120]   Now let me tell you why you might want to take advantage of their
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:12.400]   rocket mortgage quick and loans is very I
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:20.560]   One of the things I admire about quick and loans very customer focused typically in the mortgage business that mortgage folks worry more about
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.680]   Interest rates they're more about their business
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:28.960]   Than they are about you because who are you gonna call what are you gonna do?
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:33.120]   You're you're gonna go to someone else so they kind of dominate quick and loans
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:37.520]   Which is the biggest lender in the country got there not just because they have great rates
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.440]   but because they really
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.720]   Our customer forward they really think about your experience. I'll give you an example
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:48.320]   We've talked before about rocket mortgage an entirely online mortgage approval process. You could do it on your phone
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.440]   at an open house get approval
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:57.200]   And and and buy a house that is remarkable given that the industry was you know
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.440]   Really built around people going to a bank
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:06.720]   Filling out a long application getting a lot of paperwork taking weeks to do it months in some cases
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.960]   So quick and loans has already cut through the red tape with rocket mortgage now
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:17.680]   They want to reduce your anxiety. See one of the problems. This wasn't a problem until recently interest rates just started going back up
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.200]   For a long time for the last few years interest rates have been flat
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.360]   So this this anxiety I remember it because I've been
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:31.280]   You know, I remember buying homes in the era where interest rates were going up, you know half a point every month it felt like
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.960]   There's a lot of anxiety when you're shopping for a house and you don't know
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.440]   You know is the interest rate gonna go up?
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.200]   I gotta buy it before it goes up
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:45.600]   Because even a quarter of a point and interest rate increase means tens of thousands of dollars and expense over the life of the loan
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.560]   So you want you know, it's gonna be expensive. This is the most expensive thing i'm buying
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:51.760]   I gotta but you don't want pressure because it's also the most important thing you're buying
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:54.240]   It's the place you're gonna live for the next many years
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.160]   You want to have the luxury of really finding the perfect house
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.360]   This is how
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.000]   Quick and loans and rocket market is doing it. They call it the power buying process and there's two things that happen
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.360]   First as always they'll verify your income assets and credit
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.000]   Automatically they have relationships with all the financial institutions
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.680]   You just have to give them permission
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.040]   And in less than 24 hours, they'll give you something called a verified approval now
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.600]   The verified approval makes you basic so you see there's pre-qualified approval
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.840]   You get that in minutes the verified approval within 24 hours
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.160]   That is basically
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.960]   Gives you the strength of a cash buyer when you're buying a house in the seller sees verified approval. That's a guarantee
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.120]   You're good for it. You have the money
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.720]   You the loan is already approved. That's fantastic
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.040]   But the next step go down one more after pre-qualified and verified now
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.680]   We get the rate shield approval once you're verified you qualify for this all new exclusive
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.240]   Rate shield approval. They lock your rate up for 90 days
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.520]   90 days so that means you have three months to shop with no anxiety
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.920]   You know what your rates could be actually
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.280]   There is one exception that if the rate goes down your rate goes down
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.360]   So you know you're it will never know go higher and you know it might even go lower
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:11.680]   Either way you win it's the kind of thing you'd expect from america's best mortgage lender
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.560]   This is called thinking about the customer first to get started go to rocket mortgage.com slash
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.360]   Twig rocket mortgage.com slash twig
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.880]   Now I have to say the legal stuff rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.440]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.520]   Based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records equal housing lender

[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.680]   Reducing eliminating the anxiety in home buying
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.800]   Jeff Jarvis is here
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.960]   from buzz machine dot com our good friend
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.640]   Mentor, I would say you're my mentor jeff
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.920]   No, it's the opposite your mind. What do I know?
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.360]   Kevin marks. He's he's a mentor too. He's the king of the open web indy web.org
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.480]   Actually, I want to talk a little more about that in a bit kevin, but first let's talk about this google
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.680]   way back when
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.760]   Was it was it was it Brad Fitzpatrick
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:22.480]   Brian's Brian Fitzpatrick who created the data liberation front. This is more than 10 years ago
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.320]   This is what I was at. It's just that I'm okay. This was this was one this. I'll be honest. That's
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.960]   What won me over to google period? It's like any company is committed
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.840]   To me more than it's lock-in
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.160]   I love and you see so many companies that are all about locking in the you know apple just lock in lock and lock in
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.360]   So so uh Fitzpatrick and his team
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:53.280]   Always had this data great data liberation front and they even the great name data liberation front where you could get your data at a google
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.440]   There were needs to it's take out google.com now. It's like the actual
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.200]   Yeah
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.880]   Yeah, this is the old this is actually the old logo. Yeah logo, which is awesome with a frased fist
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:11.680]   Breaking the shackles binary numbers. Yeah, uh, so this google became google takeout
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.920]   so uh
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.160]   They're going they're basically that notion
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:24.160]   Of google takeout is now being extended and I have to think that maybe we can thank gdpr for this a little bit
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.960]   To the data transfer project it's data transfer project.dev
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.000]   But look who's involved in this not just google microsoft
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.640]   twitter and facebook
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.160]   They are quote committed to building a common framework with open source code
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.200]   That could connect any two online service providers. This is the thing that
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.800]   My jaw dropped enabling a seamless
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.000]   direct
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:01.920]   User initiated portability of data between the two platforms in other words no lock-in
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.000]   But it's also good for the companies because they have the chance to learn more
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.440]   Uh, okay. Yeah, so tell me tell me
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.480]   Because for I don't buy it
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.160]   Right maybe from google. I don't buy it from the other guy. Why would they do this?
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.840]   Uh, if you can this uh
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.640]   From a consumer perspective, it's like saying give us your email and we'll tell you who your friends are
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.680]   Oh
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:33.200]   How so I mean from this is not like you can say i'm gonna leave twitter or whatever I did on twitter
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.880]   I can now do on microsoft right because they don't have any sense you're not you're not shifting one for one to a new service
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.000]   It's the same
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.880]   But instead if I give permission if I say that's my data and I want to move it across because i'm gonna get benefit there
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.640]   Okay, it's easier for me to think amazon in a way because but it's not one of them
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:56.000]   Interestingly not none of these guys facebook google microsoft twitter really are in direct competition except maybe google and microsoft
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.640]   Yeah
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.280]   Yeah google plus
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.400]   Because they're both concomros you know, well, but I mean but microsoft's azure google
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:12.320]   Google services maybe a little bit right but amazon's the amazon's the
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.960]   Thousand pound giant that's one of the really really good. Yeah. Yeah, so okay
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.160]   So even looking at even looking at this white paper
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.800]   If i'm getting flashbacks to open social and some of the same diagrams that we were using
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.440]   Open social is a federated twitter basically
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.600]   Well open social was our attempt to do a unified
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.880]   API for different social networks ads so that you could write an app and run it in mobile
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.080]   social networks
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.640]   As an example and uh, I mean there are many examples
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.680]   No, this was the google project i worked on 10 years ago when i was at google
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.920]   Not not india web open social. Oh open social, but isn't that
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.000]   Yeah, i remember that isn't that ganoo ganoo social and all of those aren't those open social
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.880]   No
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.720]   That of there's there's some kind of data and mastodon
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.760]   Mastodon is built on
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:10.080]   activity screams and web finger and the o-state of stack and it's now built an activity thought which is
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.720]   Oh, okay. So there's a set of protocols there so ganoo social and mastodon they're all
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:20.480]   So there's a there's a chain of these different protocols that we've been building for a long time
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.240]   And there's there's a mobile app between them. So this this is another attempt to do this
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.240]   but this is not trying to solve
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.800]   that problem to the same extent as as
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.960]   Jeff said it's more about import export than data policy and that stuff
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.200]   and
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.960]   Facebook was like the the big company that did that they bought up
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.520]   All the other companies that were doing a dressbook import export octas and two or three others
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.200]   Um and made that their their core focus of facebook
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.600]   um and the
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.720]   And the you know the competitors to facebook have been ones that use your phone address book directly
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.720]   As your source of knowledge as opposed to something held by
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:04.320]   Facebook in the cloud and then facebook bought a couple of those as well, you know, that that's basically what what's up did
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:10.240]   They said phone numbers are your identity and your address book of contents through phone numbers is your graph
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.840]   And we'll use that as a thing
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:18.000]   So I completely then this is not this is not the blue moon event that I thought it was this is just
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.520]   To start us something good
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.560]   You know, I always approve of it when companies try and do these kinds of things
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.920]   um
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.040]   And if they if they if we can get better in trouble, that's great
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.640]   And the actual work of it is lots of very very boring discussions about
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.760]   Um, what what you call someone's first name and last name and how you structure things like that
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:42.320]   You know, we've been enough of those over the years. Um, but
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.440]   Here's here's an example
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:51.680]   In a hypothetical example, this is from the white paper a google photos you do zero wants to move their photos photos to one drive
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.520]   To microsoft they go to google's file transfer interface
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.640]   Choose the destination one drive and hit send
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.080]   I mean that is that is
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.880]   You know, that's moving off of google photos
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.920]   They're making it easier to leave
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.560]   Yeah, well, they're making easier in a google has already had this
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:18.320]   We take out right that's why it's more surprising to hear microsoft saying okay
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.880]   We're gonna do this with the google or facebook saying okay. We're gonna do this then google google's the one that's always been kind of in favor of this
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.480]   although
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.480]   Takeout delivers it in an xm l or a csv and you know
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:35.200]   Some kind of bland data format that you then have to figure out how to import and it's not yeah
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.840]   You have to download it, but but also, you know
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.360]   Dibs is something that somebody can write something against that the theory here is they can write a common api in the middle that you
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.240]   Couldn't move stuff directly, but then you have all the mapping problems that you have for those kinds of api's right
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.120]   Which is which is not trivial, but it's so instead of writing an individual adapter in effect
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.160]   That says okay. Here's how I port my twitter
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.960]   Graph to my facebook graph the companies will do that all for you transparently
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.440]   Except that that's the bit they won't give you
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:10.240]   Actually this week, you know, there's I put two things in the timeline for this both facebook and twitter have lockdown
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:16.160]   They develop a api's even further. That's right. They're under the round of facebook facebook facebook moves to restrict his api basically
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.840]   um
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.960]   Bridgey, which is one of the indie web projects that's used to move i love ranch back and forth me facebook twitter
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:29.520]   Um, it's having to give up on using facebook because the new api restrictions that facebook has put
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.640]   To fight came with janovitica. Um mean that actually they're breaking all these api's
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.800]   And twitter has just announced that they're changing they're limiting all their api's
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.680]   Notionally to fight bot bots and spam, but in practice it means that
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.440]   Um
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:51.920]   Notalive that i use to live tweet is going to be against their rules and i got shut down using it in Dubai last month
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.160]   Um because they thought i looked like a bot
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.760]   Um, and now they're they're explicitly saying if you build nap that that pose more than 300 times in three hours
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.160]   Um, then you're gonna be shut down
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.680]   Well, that seems fair. I mean who would want to post more than 300 times in three hours
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.280]   No, if i'm live if i'm live tweeting a conference as i do i can quite easily write i've
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   I've had a
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   an old limit. Yeah
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.120]   So
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   It depends you know it depends what you do
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.520]   Is like any of these things like as soon as you try and write a rule you're going to catch some people who are using them platform in productive ways
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   As well as people who are using this map
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.480]   Sorry
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.840]   So
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.800]   This is a good thing but it's not as good as i thought it was
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.160]   It's promising and we're gonna keep an eye on it
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.000]   but the the underlying challenge the hard challenge is
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.720]   understanding
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.200]   When
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.680]   When the computer is actually actually on your behalf and when it isn't
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.280]   um
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.040]   And this is this is the sort of the deep flaw that comes from units missions portal of well if i'm running this program
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.560]   It's running as me
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.800]   Um, and if i wanted to run it something else i can SU it and run it as as as the super user
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.680]   um and the the challenge is is that
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.640]   That isn't true for for ordinary users. That's a pro very program or a worldview
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.960]   Um, and but the answer is not do not give users the power to do this kind of thing
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.200]   It's make it clear what which ones are doing what?
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:31.600]   Um, and that's the you know, I think the takeout stuff is fairly clear that you are dumping out everything
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.560]   You've ever put into this site and getting it back and the facebook data dump has got better at that as well
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.520]   But they're still in this um, you know, they're still in this weird form facebook's is particularly
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.000]   Notchus in that um
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.160]   They will give you your half of all your conversations
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   They will um to
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.120]   All links to other people interjust their names
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.160]   Um, and so they're they're sort of stripping it of any context and just giving you a tech
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.400]   Text you a version of it in effect
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:04.480]   Kevin are there are there potential businesses that can be built on top of this? You know, I I add value to your photos in some way
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.840]   Uh, uh, you know give me your your all your tweets and I can do something with them
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.400]   Um
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:16.160]   Sure, I mean your theory there are and the challenge is you know, and that's actually this is this
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.280]   Is part of the GDPR rule set as well in part of the reason that I suspect that they're looking at this
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:29.120]   Point getting some of this there's data portability is one of the pillars of GDPR. Yes. Yeah, how do that
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.800]   That's kind of what I thought is this is a little GDPR response
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:40.320]   And we've had things like that here with uh, mandated transfer of data for things like um power companies
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.400]   And some kinds of financial services in the uk and you as well
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.160]   So there's if we and you know if we can do it
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.200]   It's great if you can actually define something to move something back of all without having to write a custom import script for every combination
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.000]   That is a great thing. You know, it's if I've spent chunk of my life
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.520]   Try to help build those kinds of standards and some of the work and better than others
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.600]   But the challenge is always you know, there are two challenges. One is do you actually have a mutually coherent data model?
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.040]   Um, and the other one is this permissions thing of
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.800]   Is this app acting as me or is this app exploiting me for some other purpose?
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.840]   And that's the piece that facebook swung too far one ways i swing too far back the other way
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:26.720]   All right, we have a bunch of uh, we got to get jeff out of here and uh in the next half hour, so we're gonna
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.240]   Try to throw it facebook stock is now down 20
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.000]   Wow
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.240]   See I feel like that's well, but I think that's also that's not a response obviously to the the quarterly results
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.440]   I mean it's uh
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:46.640]   Proximate too, but I think it's also just a general feeling of malleza. Oh, this is from from market from the from the announcement
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:52.080]   It took a uh, I hit right that in there and that's um loss of uh
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:58.880]   143 billion market cap. Well, I hope my blind trust by some facebook stock right now. Yeah
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.320]   Too bad to stop run by the russians
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.840]   Go ahead. Kevin. I see this is this is weird after our trading stuff. This is no actually
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:14.640]   Yeah, that's right after our trading way after ours. Yeah, uh, hey good news 24 people have now been sentenced
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.400]   in india for pretending to be the irs
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:26.000]   I love it when these things get shut down. I I actually held little hope but some of these people are getting prison sentences ranging from
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.480]   four to 20 years
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.280]   lead defendant
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.120]   Empatel was given 20 years in jail. He ran a team
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.800]   uh
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.320]   Of runners from chicago that helped receive and long to the proceeds
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:44.720]   They pretended to be the irs and the us citizen and
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.840]   immigration services, which is terrible to take advantage of people's fears
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.560]   Uh, it's good thing good thing glad they glad they did that
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.280]   Uh, let's see what else here
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.680]   um good news for people who believe in two factor google
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.720]   Says that after employing
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.400]   Hardware keys
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.360]   For 85 000 plus employees not a single one of them was fished
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:20.560]   That since early 2017 they started using the ubeki this is from brian Krebs Krebs on
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.400]   Security and now word that google is going to make their own this is bad news for ubeki
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.240]   Unfortunately, uh ubeki which kind of created and I use these ubekeys
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.320]   Uh created a hardware key that uh provides a second a factor
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   Now google apparently is going to offer something they're called the titan key
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.560]   Which includes giving that one out at various have things. Yeah, it's not yet public, but eventually you'll be able to get it
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.960]   They uh, it does both bluetooth
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.760]   I think there's two keys
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.600]   Uh, and this is what google requires if you use their hardcore authentication
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.240]   Which I tried for about a day until I realized that it broke everything
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.960]   Uh, but you can use bluetooth you need bluetooth for something like an iphone
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.880]   Which has no usb access and then the other one is just a hardware usb key type type a key
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:17.440]   But you get an adapter you press the button on the titan and it uh, I'm not sure if it's like the ubeki that it generates new
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.640]   One-time passwords all the time the original ubeki was just a single long string like a typewriter
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.040]   Then they got some some smarts in their processor in there and it was doing one-time passwords
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:33.440]   I'm it's I'm not clear on whether the titan security key will do that. I but knowing it's google. I think they probably will
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.120]   It's uh, it's a little more bulky than the ubeki
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.040]   They say they'll be they'll be selling it by the end of summer
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.240]   From I should show I have my I keep my
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:51.200]   Keep my ubeki. Oh, I don't have my ubeki on me. I have it my briefcase keep it on me at all times
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:58.560]   But there's just the point is that it's even better than just an authenticator for two factor
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.280]   And it just not basically not fishable
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:07.040]   So I got a fisher fishing attempt today I think
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:14.320]   I'm gonna put this on you critical security alert sign in attempt was blocked
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:22.560]   From google blocked them, but you should check what happened, but you should you should kick click this link, right?
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.040]   Exactly. Yeah
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:30.480]   Yeah, but as well does what a hold on there if you know if you were spelling errors, I got one that was really well done
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.280]   that that uh
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:39.600]   Almost bit me. No, actually I it didn't almost bite me, but it was pretty terrible. It says
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.680]   Hi
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.840]   Well, actually the subject is a password your password is and it was a it was a not it was a password
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.480]   I used on sites. I really didn't care about
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.720]   A long time ago. I haven't used it in ages, but it was one of my passwords
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:00.240]   Your password is this it's your attention. Yeah, that got my attention and it said so
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:05.360]   We figured out your password and uh, and you were logging in
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:12.720]   When you were logging into this porn site, we hacked your system. We videoed. We made a video of you
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.400]   Cheese look at the porn site and of the porn site
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.600]   And oh by the way, we got all of your contacts
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.240]   And if you don't send us $2,000 in bitcoin in the next 48 hours
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.120]   We're going to send this video to everybody in your contact list
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.120]   Oh, so combine that with the fact that it is my password
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:37.840]   It's not which they go from one of the possible efficient which which and of course this is and I bet you this really works
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:43.600]   because yeah, if you you know all these data breaches if you go to have i've been pwned
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:50.160]   You'll see that your email address the one they used and some of your passwords were leaked from target and
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.880]   All these other places and of course if you used reused your password on an adult site, then maybe
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.520]   This would be credible. You don't remember
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.480]   um, so I bet you what they did is they go through the database of
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.560]   You know
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.400]   Breaches get all the passwords and emails and just send this email to everybody and I bet you it works pretty darn good
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.680]   $2,000 the only the only thing is you have to figure out how to send bitcoin
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.040]   And I bet that's the only thing that kept them for making millions off of this scam
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.360]   Yeah, needless to say I didn't send them anything. So if you get any emails
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.120]   With videos of me, please destroy those immediately
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:35.600]   I thought that was a really good scam
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:40.000]   I was pretty nervous because you'd imagine the valgollovonic skin response goes
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.040]   Yeah, because it's because it looks legitimate, right?
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.880]   The entire web is full of videos of you Leo when they could just send out all the cussets
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.960]   I know oh wait a minute. Here's an article from the independent dot co dot uk about this
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.080]   very scam the sextortion scam
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.400]   Danny Bradbury knows your password, but don't fall for it
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.720]   Oh, yeah, this is the one I got. This is exactly the one I got
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.600]   Because the thing is there there are enough password leak dumps from something you looked into a while ago
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.280]   Fortunately, I'm I'm sophisticated enough that I immediately
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.680]   Groc'd what had happened and just ignored it
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.600]   But I have to admit I thought for a minute. Well, could that actually have happened?
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:24.240]   This is exactly oh except that brian Krebs only asked for $1,400 the one I got was for $2,000
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:29.760]   But they do say if you don't know how to send bitcoin
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.880]   Click this link for a video that will explain it
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.880]   Which means I bet they got very few responses. I don't know maybe they made some money
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:44.000]   All three recipients who sent their this email to brian Krebs
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.440]   Said that the password was close to 10 years old
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.160]   And none of them had been used any time on their current computers and that's exactly the case with me
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.360]   It's clearly from a password dump from ages ago
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.320]   But this is why you don't use the same password over and over
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.840]   According to the fbi
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.400]   Never send compromising images of yourself to anyone
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:12.160]   No matter who they are or they say they are don't open attachments for people you don't know
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.600]   And turn off by the way, that's bad advice
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.320]   Because the attachments are always from people you know
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:23.680]   Who have been hacked and in general be wary of opening attachments even from those you do know
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.320]   I think be more wary of ones from people you do know
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:32.880]   Turn off and or cover any web cameras when you're not using them especially if you're pleasuring yourself
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.600]   [Laughter]
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:41.840]   I have never put tape over my cameras, but I guess maybe maybe I should
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.040]   So just a word of warning if you get that email yep, you're not alone
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.480]   A lot of people getting it and that's exactly you you you you got it immediately Kevin you knew
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.520]   Yeah, yeah
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:01.360]   I got a really annoying one. I'm lost it. Well, my wife did somebody signed up for ebay with her email address
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.320]   Whoa, which which is the xkcd
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.640]   Yeah reverse. I didn't do that problem, but the thing is
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:14.960]   ebay does not send you an email saying please verify your email address and give you an ink saying no
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.840]   This is this this is a mistake so stupid
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.400]   And they allow people to start bidding on things before they verify the what
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.480]   Oh
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.200]   So yeah, because I get I get emails all the time
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:33.600]   Like that. Oh, you just signed up for please confirm your address because my email address is very very well known
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.280]   And I just figure I screw it, but that's that's one to know about you could be
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.120]   Wow, so so I said my office getting all these things
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.920]   So I eventually went into over there account with her email with the email address because I could yeah
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.640]   And then change the email address to the name of the c o vbay at genome.com
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.440]   so
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.880]   We see how
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.680]   They're not doing the right thing. They're not authentic. No, no, it's ebay. So ebay
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.360]   I'm not I mean jimmy. I'm at ebay
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.800]   They should not allow you to bid until the email has been authenticated in the passwords
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:16.080]   But also and this is this is one for the engineers listening when you send out an email saying please verify this email give me a button to say no
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.160]   I do not verify this email good point
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:24.880]   Because because this is a structural problem the people can sign up to sign you on the phone and you'd about saying no not me
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   Waymo has
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:33.680]   Phoenix, Arizona and its environs are now becoming the place for self-driving vehicles
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.240]   So a word of warning to pedestrians
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:41.920]   Waymo google's self-driving car is now down there and this is the strangest thing they've done a deal with
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.440]   Walmart you can go to walmart.com
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.240]   order groceries
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:53.120]   A self-driving waymo will appear. It's not clear whether there's a safety driver or it's just an empty car
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:58.480]   Will appear at your door you get in it takes you to walmart where you pick up your groceries and takes you back
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.640]   Clearly this is a completely unnecessary trip
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.760]   Yeah
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:10.640]   But I realize the point of which is to get you used to the idea of getting in a self-driving vehicle and letting it take you somewhere in back
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.160]   Right
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.720]   It's very there also
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.600]   This one makes more sense or didn't do it with a rental car agency
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   Uh, so it'll take you to the rental agency that makes sense because you need a car and you can't get there
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.520]   Yeah
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:33.440]   Uh the guy who said amazon should replace libraries here
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.840]   Uh, I know you use cookies fast company. It's okay
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.880]   Does anybody like when those cookie things come up what?
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.320]   There's there's usually there's not a like no. I don't want to use cookies. It's just like
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.960]   Click a click x
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.560]   But under a new gpr you can't require it for entry anymore
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.920]   Yeah, which is which is why I got read drunk anymore
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.880]   Right not missing it actually no
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.160]   Trunk just fired half of the daily news
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.120]   Newsroom including the editor in chief when I was there the daily news
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:17.200]   Uh, we have 450 people in the newsroom. No, they have 45 45 1/10 the number. Yep
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:22.080]   And there was so many great. I was saying all this money is going straight to the guy
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.600]   They fired for being a grover because he got a 15 million or something
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.480]   He got a huge settlement and by the way trunk went gravely into debt to buy all these companies. So the it's it's his
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.080]   It's his golden parachute and debt service. Yep
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.720]   Ah
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.720]   The Forbes contributor who wrote that article saying
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:48.880]   Amazon should replace local libraries to save taxpayers money the the piece was immediately pulled down
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.600]   However, preserve for posterity by fast company
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.840]   So just remember when you write something stupid. It's never gonna die
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.480]   That's the problem with the Forbes contributor in that I hate I saw something that said that
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.680]   This guy I don't know if it's true or not, but that this guy paid it to be in it. Right. I bet that's true
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.640]   Wouldn't be surprised
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   Do they vet these people at all?
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.840]   They say they do but what's up something to
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.600]   Something to do there's there's tears right there's a Forbes
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.920]   staffer who's good
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:27.280]   Then there's kind of selected Forbes contributors who they actually do select when they pay and then there's
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.160]   This guy people who are good, but what's to the the radius?
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.680]   They must pick is what what would Forbes interest in doing it be unless they could make some money on it
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.800]   Or maybe it's just free content. Oh, it's free content
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:47.920]   It's a huge lose to work and who was also at trunk and and took over the LA times for about two hours
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.720]   um, this was his
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:56.240]   Brain fart and it it massively increased the amount of content they got yeah
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.560]   Even though it's bad content who cares, right? It's just it's more much of it is
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.680]   The problem is you just don't know you don't know before you go Forbes link. It might be okay, but it might be crap
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.320]   It's usually amusing
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:13.280]   Yeah, but that's the point, but this is the structural problem i was talking about at the beginning is that they're optimizing for
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.480]   People being idiots about libraries so they found some
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:22.480]   Oh, you think you think that's that's drunk economist in Long Island who's who's worried
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.240]   thing
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.000]   It's just a bunch of homeless people in the library and the bunch of dead trees
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:35.200]   Oh, just go Starbucks instead dust dust all over dust dust
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.720]   Um, but that's this passes for discourse now. I know it's so pathetic
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.880]   That's why you gotta watch this show because this is good stuff. Yeah, right?
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   um
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:53.040]   What's his face? I'm just the smoke gorgeous something are you worried Thompson? Go ahead just posted a great link about this which is
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:54.400]   um
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.600]   I will send you the link put it in the chat room as you have been you
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.400]   So good Kevin spends a lot of time in our chat room
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.040]   Hang on
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:06.800]   So this is this is sort of symptomatic of this and interesting culture clash
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.160]   um
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.760]   So clike there's there's um a large profile about
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.760]   um goop and
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.960]   Where did the paltrow in the New York Times? I was reading is
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   But but but clivers pulled out this piece with saying goop was originally partnered with conda nass
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.680]   But um gwyneth would object it to them in fact checking the articles. Yes because
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.040]   dare come in now
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.960]   Goop is full of all sorts of bizarre propositions about yeah
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.080]   Things to put near hoo-hoo and stuff
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:40.000]   Yes, I did the other thing I learned from this
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.600]   I said rather this because because he talks about how fact checking actually works
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.800]   Yes
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.600]   magazines
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.600]   Which you know why this was
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.120]   I uh, I wrote a piece for the uh a arp magazine
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.560]   And I got like three or four ea-a-a piece by the way, they have very strict rules about
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.040]   attribution was a it was a 500 word piece was really short, but there were facts in it
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.640]   So I made sure I had footnotes and the attribution everything I still got called
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.240]   Uh by the fact checker, which I welcomed I thought it was great
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.320]   Because I had asserted that the zenith tv that I watched the moon landing on
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.440]   Was actually lower resolution when then my apple watch
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.360]   so
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.800]   Uh, I had I I wrote a fairly long email explaining
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.920]   Well, you there's apples and oranges because that scan lines versus dots, but effectively
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.000]   It was
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.760]   And they said okay good. I said, you know, you could if you're worried about it just just you could say approximately
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:38.160]   That's what they I think that's what they end up doing what I didn't know is the goop
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:41.440]   comes from gwyneth paltros initials gp
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:46.960]   And that you add the double o's because somebody told her that if you're gonna if you're gonna be a successful
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.960]   internet company, you have to have double o's
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:55.120]   Okay
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.120]   Goop it's um
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.560]   Fascinating
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.080]   Fascinating
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:05.360]   Um, I was in the aspen, you know a few weeks ago and of course they have a goop store course
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.200]   Did you pick up a yoni egg while you were there? I don't
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:14.160]   How about a rose quartz soothing face massage roller?
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.800]   Well, if only I had I wouldn't be pink
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:24.800]   The jade egg the rose quartz soothing massage roller all on display at goop's wellness summit in los angeles in june
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:32.480]   Well, yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. Well, you don't you know what fact checking can be a pain
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:36.800]   Because it just
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.600]   Sometimes you just want to say what you want to say
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   Orrin hatches not dead
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:48.880]   He tweeted he said google we should talk
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:55.760]   Um, but really he should have mentioned it to wiki pedia because as you can see that's where it comes from this snippet
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:00.320]   Is a wiki pedia article that says orrin hatched died september 11th
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.720]   2017 which was you know with wiki pedia is probably some wag
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:09.440]   Well, it may I mean those aren't all wiki pedia
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.760]   Um, so they do he's put get someone there by pausing them off the web. Yeah
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:18.400]   So knows anyway, he's not dead nor is nor is fish
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.840]   So this was the this is the famous episode of this where people magazine when I was there
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.640]   Um killed off a vagota
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.920]   And he then bought an ad a variety of him sitting in a casket reading people
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:40.080]   There is is there a website that if you go to is a vagota dead dot com
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.200]   Yeah
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:44.240]   Is let's just check. Oh, he did he passed away. Yeah, he did
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.240]   Oh

[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:56.480]   Probably won't be changing again. Is it hgps or not?
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:02.080]   Oh god, I don't know should we look at the bathroom should we look at the source code is probably
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:08.640]   Yeah, it's no it is it's hgps. I'm not getting a warning. Oh, no. I'm on microsoft's edge browser
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.720]   Say they don't I don't tell you about that stuff
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:17.360]   I have to say I am tempted not to use chrome just because of that. Oh, oh
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:20.880]   I'm a puff
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   Oh, I'm a puffeda

[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.760]   Probably

[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.120]   Hey, you did
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.000]   You could lie depends what you're watching and I bet you do. Yeah, yeah

[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:52.000]   Thank god disney is the winner after a sky going to go after sky
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.800]   Comcast of course, uh after the time one or 18 team merger was uh approved by a judge immediately
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.480]   uh
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.720]   filed a 65 billion dollar bid
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.440]   Disney up to its offer to 71.3 billion
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.080]   You know at this point
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.560]   Disney should be able to go back to their original bid
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:16.000]   but yeah
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.360]   It's uh
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.280]   Now you wonder is it a little collusion?
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.200]   And congratulations to susan fowler
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.600]   She wrote the very famous memo that brought travis calonic down at uber
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.320]   She was just hired by the new york times
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.160]   She's going to be writing about technology based in san francisco the times technology opinion editor
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.360]   We should get her on one of our shows now. That'd be gray. Yes
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.480]   She's susan fowler regetti
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:51.280]   But we know her susan fowler for her memo gosh. It was only in february 2017 that she wrote that memo
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.560]   But yeah, no, that was I was
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.120]   I actually saw her at a company. She spoke at a conference
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:04.160]   I was at like the week before was talking about microservices and very hardcore technical standard stuff and then the next week she's
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.520]   suddenly
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.720]   So
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:12.400]   About a worker in fact and then next week she'd publish this thing and then there's now now a fresh and journalist
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.560]   Which is quite a transition
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.840]   What do you think of the cdr article?
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:22.800]   Uh by james ball. We need a new model for tech journalism
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.360]   I haven't seen this one was this
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360]   Well, I figured jeff must have seen it
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:28.480]   Yeah, yeah
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.840]   I mean on the one hand he says we say this for years
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:38.960]   We've whiplashed our readers by first singing the praises of tech and then now coming down hard
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:44.880]   On to get google and facebook and all that i've been overboard on both houses. Yeah, that's sort of true. Yeah
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:50.400]   um baseball's a good journalist next guardian so, um, what
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.200]   I mean, what is his what is his?
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:37:00.480]   I like tldr it and he says ending technology journalism as we know it won't save tech let alone the world
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.480]   But it might be a good first step that worries me that worries me a little bit
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.680]   There will always be another product launch another set of results
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:15.120]   We've talked about both today another patcher redesign another international conference to keep the beat writers well beaten down
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:21.360]   Different younger reporters. Yes. I agree. Should cover that kind of incremental change. It's a way to cut their teeth
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.000]   Or better yet. Let's step back from product news and let companies do their own pr
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.280]   Well, I kind of agree with that, but then what are we gonna talk about?
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:36.480]   I think more more than most more than most tech journalists
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.680]   Certainly on this show and I think it kind of on all of our shows we talk more about a higher level
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.560]   uh, uh stuff than just like new product stuff
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:52.880]   Yeah, we're talking more about what it means if you watched last week mike elgan mentioned how he lives in chrome and the chrome
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.280]   Extensions he uses he's made now a list of it. We did it. Yes. Oh good elgan.com chrome extensions
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:05.680]   But I want to tell you that he will be on twitter on sunday with jason calicanas. That's gonna be a hell of a show
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:08.240]   And uh, he'll talk about his list
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:10.720]   including facebook purity
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.440]   I'm damn
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.400]   added
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.800]   Fb purity to my browser it stands not for facebook but fluff busting
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:23.200]   Facebook without the junk fb purity
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.800]   What what if if only I had facebook I could find out what that's all about
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.080]   I keep you know, I
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:38.560]   Didn't delete facebook I deactivated it because this is not this is a bad thing because I
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:42.800]   Sometimes maybe I thought I'd just log in quickly to check something. I didn't want to lose my name
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:46.000]   So I just it's like it's a it's a ghost account
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.840]   That's okay, right
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.840]   No
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:55.680]   Jeff, I know you're a new former snobbery. It's like saying I don't know
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.680]   It's the worst guy in snobber
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:02.400]   Yes, i'm only I don't listen to podcast. I don't listen npr
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.280]   Yeah

[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:58.720]   um
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:59.840]   but
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:06.480]   The and london but but baltimore is ongoing san francisco starting in a in a while. Oh nice at mozzilla
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.040]   And then there's another thing that's that's happening on the 31st
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:14.400]   Which is the decentralized web hackers day
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:20.080]   Which is the day before the decentralized web summit thing at the ejna archive
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:26.320]   So they've put they were putting a day together at that. So it's a it's a whole day for doing like a mini indy web hacking camp
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.000]   um
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.600]   in san francisco, so the san francisco got along to that and then there's a
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:36.240]   Um, the same night. There's a party at the ejna archive for the decentralized web thing. So
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.720]   That's that that's the the event of the um next couple weeks
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.560]   Um, and then other things I had a couple other things
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:52.640]   Oh, yes. So there's a couple of little browsery things. Um, there's this thing called kill sticky. And so you're we were talking about
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:59.680]   The problem with every time I go to an american newspaper. It covers the page with crap about
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.920]   I thought I can't be bothered to go through. Yes, this gets rid of quite a lot of them
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:08.400]   And it basically takes anything on the page that doesn't scroll when you scroll
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:15.040]   It makes makes those disappear. It's a book booklet. So you could just put it on your razor tool bar and then click it whenever you don't like
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.360]   Nice
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:21.920]   Yeah, so it works for medium. It works for looking at like what's these sites you click to and
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:27.120]   Before you immediately think the screen is covered with bits and bobs and this gets rid of those bits and bobs
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.560]   And it's really just about six lines of javascript. It's not a big deal you could
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:38.000]   This is something really expensive. Yeah, and another book mark. I'm bringing book. Oh, it is. This is from 2013
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.440]   Yeah, that's a problem for a long time
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:47.840]   Wow another another old bookmark is the contrast widget that that aida wrote
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.400]   Um, what this one does is when you click it, it tells you which picks of your website
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.600]   Need better contrast. So if you if you click the highlight local address elements button in the corner
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.000]   Yeah
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.720]   They don't so don't then the bottom screen just roll it over
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.400]   And there's this it shows you which ones are too low contrast
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:11.200]   So that would work very well on those google results you were showing us where they were put with the numbers in gray on gray
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:12.320]   Right
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.320]   This is good. This is good
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:20.160]   So this is this is something to take when someone hangs you a new website is that only like why can't i read this?
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:25.440]   Yeah, this is uh, this is a d a dot is
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.760]   the is a
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:31.760]   American disability act or is it just a woman named a
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.200]   Aida was kind of who was Samson
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.640]   That's his convenience that she is named aida and can help with the ada
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:45.760]   At least there we go people who hate low-country sites. Yeah. Yeah
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:51.040]   Kevin, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate all you do for the open web
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.360]   um
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.120]   I'm sad about bridgy. I feel like a lot of those technologies
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.040]   How about how's pub hub sub bub hub sub pub bub pub pub
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.720]   Pub sub hub hub is now a web sub is a
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:11.360]   W3c standard and we've got a new new thing that's underway called micro sub
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.000]   um, which is
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.800]   Trying to give you a way to do feed really again
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:23.680]   But to separate the feed fetching path and the UI so that we can write a couple of things that do the feed fetching and have different
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:28.240]   Uis that work against it. So if you if you if you're pining for google reader and the
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.160]   And feed reading
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.760]   Micro sub is the thing to look at there micro sub
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:43.200]   Yes, I still have my with known site is bet have been has been ben word murler kind of given up on that or is that still a
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:49.040]   Thing is doing other things. He's he's he's working for matter the the
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:55.520]   Media, I like matters. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah, you should go to their demo days
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:59.760]   Um, but um, it's an open source project. It's still is still going
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:04.240]   Um, but they're no longer accepting new sign up. So you have to install yourself
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:12.640]   but it's it's still it's still running it's um and you can you can install it on different housing platforms my known my known site slowly
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:20.880]   Falling falling apart. It just doesn't the images don't work. Everything's broken now. So I guess I'll probably abandon it. That's sad
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:28.480]   Or run it myself, but there you know, what's moving to your own housing. Yeah, maybe that's the way to do it. Yeah
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.200]   With known calm. Thank you, kevin
