[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.680]   Ronamadio is joining us from ours,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.120]   Technica, great to see you Ron.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.320]   I just want you to know you have permission to talk about anything you want.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.680]   OK, cool.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.200]   But notice he's not going to give me that permission.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.680]   Oh, no, no, Jeff Jarvis does not have permission to talk about anything.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.520]   No, I don't.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.760]   No, of course you do.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's buzzmachine.com/jervis.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.440]   That's his blog.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.480]   He's also, of course, a great writer and professor of journalism
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.240]   at the City University of New York in the graduate school there.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.920]   Nice to see you, Jeff.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.400]   Always good to see you, boss.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.640]   And from Austin, Texas, we missed her last week.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.400]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.200]   No, we did.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.520]   You were here, but you weren't in the room with us.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.200]   If you'd only been in the room with us, I would have remembered you.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   Wow.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.800]   No, no, I remember you.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.040]   It was just, you know, it was so nice because we had Jason and we had Jeff.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.400]   And I just felt like, gosh, if we say we missed having you there, we were like--
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.200]   Keep taking.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.000]   Keep taking for you.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   She, I get away with nothing with Stacey.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.480]   She knows exactly what I'm thinking.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.120]   No, you don't know what none of us does.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.080]   None of us does.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.960]   Do you want to buy a $5,000 jam board?
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.400]   And oh, by the way, you need to buy a $1,600 stand.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.040]   And if you want to use it, you have to pay $600 a year for service.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   Wow.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   Yeah, but that's the CTO's problem.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   That's fine.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   I have that.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   You know, I mean, it's--
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.600]   I will add one.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.920]   I won't water for the school.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.320]   Yeah, so this is a new whiteboard from Google that they announced sometime ago, but it is
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.480]   now available as of today available.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.520]   It is competing directly with Microsoft Surface Hub, which is also a giant screen whiteboard.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.640]   But there are also a lot of lesser known devices, schools, usies and others.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.440]   The difference here is this is really tightly integrated with Google services.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.880]   In fact, you have to have a G Suite subscription just to use it.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.640]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.160]   No, Jeff will be so thrilled.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.160]   Something you can do with--
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.040]   Finally, if I spend $7,500, I get some privilege for having a G Suite account.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.560]   Thank you very much, Google.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.520]   So who wants to-- I like the big, by the way, the big crayon pencils it comes with.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   And that thing--
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   I think you can make that your desk.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.880]   And the right is an eraser.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.360]   It's very fissure price.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   Yes.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   Yes.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.840]   I'm like, oh, it's like my daughter's easel from when she was like three.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.560]   But I think this is Google trying to make this friendly, right?
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.240]   Well, it's also accessible design.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   Right.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.560]   The cool thing about it is it's like fully Google Docsified, where you can have mirrors
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.280]   of it open and everyone can see what everyone else is doing in real time.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.120]   So if you don't want to walk up to the board and draw on it, you will have a copy of the
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   board on your tablet.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.800]   And you can draw on it with your finger.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.240]   And everybody everywhere gets a mirrored version of the Jamboard, whether you're in the room
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   or not.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.840]   If you're sitting there with a Chromebook, you can throw stuff up on the board, right?
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.920]   Because it's totally vertically integrated, because it's Google hardware and Google software,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.720]   you can get all sorts of fun little tricks like that that actually work, I guess.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.640]   Now we were playing this video earlier, and Paul Therat said, you know, there's something
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.400]   about video when you draw on something that Microsoft said the same problem with their
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   surface stuff.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.200]   There seems to be more latency than there is.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.040]   So I don't know how much latency there is, but Google says, oh no, it's very direct drive
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.880]   when you're when you're writing on it.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   Hi.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.560]   Finger erasing finger drawing or big fat pencil.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.200]   Oh, look, it turned into a circle.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   Oh, I wonder.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   It used that auto.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   I wonder if it's auto doodle.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   I wonder if they're going to do this.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   Here we're going to see it.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   No, it's not a baseball lit.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   It's a turkey.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   I don't know.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   It's a show.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   Oh, it's a show.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.600]   Cover that bad drawing with a real shell.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   Okay.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.320]   And yeah, I suppose for corporate device, this is your boardroom device that that's probably
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.760]   a good price, $5,000.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.120]   These are real boardroom looking people.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.720]   It actually looks more like SMB kind of thing.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   You would still pay for this.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.920]   I mean, it's cheap for corporate boards.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   Right.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   Good.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.320]   So I think we and designers too, right?
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.560]   These people are hip.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.920]   I think we can make twish.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.480]   This is exactly what we do.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   It's like a
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.640]   It's a they love this this boardroom stuff.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.320]   All boardrooms have this stuff.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.440]   Now somebody was telling me that one of the things Microsoft's a surface hub does that
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.120]   this doesn't that should do there are Microsoft's a little bit more cognizant of what corporations
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.120]   need.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.960]   For instance, when you walk out of the room, the surface hub erases itself immediately
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.960]   so that it can steal your brilliant ideas.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.280]   Things like that.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.880]   Um, I don't know.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.480]   So it's you can get in Carmine red.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.280]   Cobalt blue or graphite gray.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.520]   Of course, everybody's going to buy the red.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.320]   Five blue blue blue is the best color blue is the best color.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   Blue is the best color.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.720]   What are you in grade school?
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.200]   Blue is the best color red.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.000]   Everybody knows red is the best color.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.560]   Anyway, I was going to go with boring executive gray.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.260]   Well, you can have each of you can have your own $5,000 wall mount included.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.340]   But if you want that rolling stand and really, I think that's the fun thing is you roll it
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.340]   around.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.020]   That's another $1,200 bucks.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.660]   They are giving out deals.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.120]   What they don't mention here, I wish they would.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.680]   Maybe I have to click through is that there is a yearly fee.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.240]   They're given a deal on the yearly fee.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.760]   It's only $300 management support fee.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.140]   If you buy it right now, but eventually it'll be $600.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.240]   50 bucks a month.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.000]   What do you get to that?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.980]   Do you get the Google G Suite apps?
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.380]   No, it's a management support fee.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.940]   I don't know.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.820]   They're not clear about that.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.340]   Maybe they're concerned about them breaking down and they want to make sure the overhead
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.660]   is in place for a long period of time.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.980]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.060]   At the World Trade Center, they have TVs in every meeting room.
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.060]   They're pretty much useless.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.460]   If they ran some kind of software and were touch-screen, that would be at least a little
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.820]   bit better than these giant screens they mount on the wall because they look good.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.100]   It's like a smart board.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.320]   It's like any other kind of board.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.880]   You draw on it.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   You can save it.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   You can print it.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   Other people can share it.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.400]   You can show video and things on it, right?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   You do video conferencing.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.760]   Ah, yes, they show video conferencing.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   So you can do that.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.040]   But I don't think you can just play YouTube videos.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.520]   I don't think it's like a real operating system.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   I don't know.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   Really?
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   But you can say you could throw things up in your Chromebook.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520]   Can you throw a video?
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.240]   Yeah, it's got Google Cast.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   I'm going to class for it.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240]   No, no, you can Google Cast.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   You're right.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.300]   Built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, HDMI, and Google Cast.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.980]   So you could-- but I don't know if you could-- I don't know.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.980]   I don't know.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.060]   I guess I have to buy one and find out.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.740]   You can always donate it when you're done to a great school.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.500]   University like mine.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.540]   No use it as one of the TVs next year, and then you can draw rabbit ears on people in
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.540]   most ashes of the--
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.540]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.540]   Yes.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.540]   I can kind of do that now because I've got a Surface Studio.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.740]   So I can-- you know, I have the ability to tell us straight on my screen.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.740]   You know--
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.740]   Oh, nice.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.740]   Grog's on to something here.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.740]   You can start drawing on our screen.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.240]   I would like to draw on your face, though.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   I already have a mustache.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   No, I put devil mores.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.140]   No, but I'm not-- I mean, this is similar, really.
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.740]   It's a little smaller, but this is kind of the same idea.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.740]   I can--
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.340]   What if you get one of your windows?
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.340]   It jam-board your desk.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.140]   Yeah, I don't think it's designed to be your desk.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.140]   Oh.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.140]   It's designed to be on the wall.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.140]   That's the Surface table.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.340]   That'll be your desk.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.340]   That's true.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.740]   We've probably spent more time than this deserves, but I just--
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:13.740]   That's true.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.240]   I just-- I've--
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   Yeah, I just freaked.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   We won't-- we won't.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   It's pretty cool.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.040]   I kind of would like to have it.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.740]   I think I applied for beta on it and never worked out.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.740]   I did too, yeah.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.740]   Yeah, same here.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.740]   So there you go.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.740]   Did you guys hear back?
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.740]   Well, now you can all buy it.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.220]   That's pretty rude, Google.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.820]   I do have an apps account after all.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.820]   We use a chalkboard.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.740]   In fact, I've always on TV used a chalkboard because I like it
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.220]   because it's so low tech that I like the idea of having a green
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.740]   chalkboard and chalk, and I make all our hosts draw on it.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.140]   But-- because this would be-- this is more like, oh, obviously,
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.340]   you're going to have a smartboard.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.740]   No, I want to be low tech.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.340]   I have a whiteboard, so--
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.340]   Whiteboard's good.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.340]   --like low tech with you.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.940]   It's not great for TV because it's so bright.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.620]   And that's why-- I don't know if we could actually use the
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.540]   Jamboard on TV.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.540]   We always had troubleshooting smartboards.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.540]   But that wasn't long enough.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.060]   And Jeff.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.900]   And Jeff.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.620]   Yeah, he's too white.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.820]   Yes, that's right.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.460]   I am a human whiteboard drawn on me.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:18.460]   YouTube's virtual reality platform is adding shared rooms
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.220]   that will let people view 360 degree video together.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.100]   This is part of Daydream VR.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.460]   Actually, this is like spaces.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.500]   Facebook showed this at their developer conference.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.420]   Google has now.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.380]   And they didn't-- I don't know if they showed this at the VR
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.660]   talk at Google I/O. I don't think so.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.300]   No, they didn't.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.820]   But that reminds me of Turn Table FM, those little people.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.500]   Do you remember being--
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.060]   Yeah, you'd go in and you'd play your music, and then people
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.460]   would applaud in the audience.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.540]   And it just looks just like that, doesn't it?
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.220]   Share a three--
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.980]   I'm not sure I get this.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.940]   You can also-- you can customize your human looking avatar.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.220]   They'll speak out loud in real time.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.660]   So it's kind of like Avatar Chat, which we used to use back
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.740]   in 1998 on tech TV.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:10.540]   Voice will be the way people express themselves in VR,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.780]   says YouTube product lead, Aaron Teague.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.700]   A lot of resectioning video versions.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.860]   Go ahead.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.700]   No, you go.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.180]   These 360 video things are like the worst, because they take away
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.700]   all of the directors' cinematography and everything.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.180]   You have no idea where to look.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.180]   So I just sit there and spin constantly when I'm in these things,
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.260]   because I'm always worried about what am I missing, what's
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.380]   happening behind me.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:43.780]   It's way nicer to just have a real regular video in front of you.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.500]   I never get it, and they always need
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.180]   to be ridiculously high resolution.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.020]   And they're just weird.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.520]   So--
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.940]   --made up FOMO for VR.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.340]   VR 360.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.020]   Yeah, basically.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.900]   Sometime around now, I remember Second Life
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.100]   was supposed to release a 360 degree VR version of Second Life,
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.100]   called Sansar.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.980]   Second Life needs a Second Life.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.900]   It would be Third Life.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.780]   But it's not out yet.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.820]   But it was supposed to come out right around now.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.340]   Are you-- tell me, Leo, you're not still in Second Life.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.580]   No, I have-- by the way, though, I love my name in Second Life.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.980]   Pruneface spatula.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.380]   What?
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.020]   No, when-- if you remember, you couldn't just pick your name,
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.020]   like, be Leo LaPorte.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.060]   You had to pick from a menu of First and Last Names.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.940]   And I think that was the auto-generated one.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.820]   And I liked it so much.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.500]   I just said, well, I'll keep that.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.140]   Pruneface.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.020]   We can call you Spoonface, or Pruneface.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.620]   Pruneface.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.460]   Call me Pruneface.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.580]   Well, wasn't he a Batman villain?
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.540]   Dick Tracy, or--
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.060]   It was.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.260]   It was a Dick Tracy villain.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.620]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:47.940]   It was.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.460]   All right.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.860]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.260]   You really are old.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.100]   As I--
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   Wow.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.380]   Back in the big war, in the great war,
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.020]   we used to read Dick Tracy.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.580]   That was one of my first EW covers, Dick Tracy movie.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.060]   Oh, with Warren Beatty.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.500]   Warren Beatty?
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:03.980]   And Warren Beatty.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.980]   And Madonna.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.500]   Go.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.180]   And Madonna.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.460]   That's where they kind of-- that little thing.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.260]   Everyone had a theme with Warren Beatty.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.980]   Everyone had a thing with Madonna.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.900]   There wasn't anything special about that either.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.500]   Now, let's talk about--
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.900]   I know what you want to talk about, Rana,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.400]   Madia.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.100]   One of the things that was big at Google I/O--
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.420]   or many new things-- but all incremental improvements.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.420]   But self-driving cars-- in fact, there is some self-driving car.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:38.540]   News Ford has fired its three-year CEO, Mark Hurd,
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.300]   and replaced--
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   That'll feel--
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:40.800]   Fields.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.900]   Mark Hurd was the HPCO.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.100]   I confused it, too.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.180]   And replaced him with the head of Jim Hackett,
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.020]   the head of their Ford's autonomous car vehicle project.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.060]   Although, even though he's the head of the autonomous vehicle
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.860]   project, he came from Steelcase.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.340]   And he's a Mr. Fix-It.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.100]   Which was an office--
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.620]   don't they make those big file cabinets in the offices?
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.620]   Steelcase.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.020]   And metal wheels.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.020]   Chairs on wheels.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.020]   Chairs.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.700]   And cubicles.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.340]   You know, it wasn't exactly a high-tech company.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.220]   Steelcase is actually very high-tech.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.220]   Believe it or-- so Steelcase has been very forward-looking
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.060]   in how to embed technology into its products
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.260]   for productivity and workers.
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.580]   They have a really smart lab group.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.220]   So I know.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.140]   How do you know that?
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.100]   Because we--
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.820]   We're kind of thinking of Stacey, though.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.620]   Wait, what were you doing at our IoT conference?
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.020]   We had someone from Steelcase.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   Oh, OK.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.940]   It's slated to come.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.460]   Smart pelvis.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.260]   He's also a turnaround guy, though, right?
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.260]   It's interesting because, you know, we got to spend a lot of time
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:55.260]   with Ford's previous CEO, Alan Malali, who I had huge respect for
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.260]   and who really took Ford from a struggling company.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260]   They never took money from the federal government.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.260]   The other big-- other members of the Big Three did.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.260]   Ford really--
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.260]   Big quality.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.260]   And turned it around, and then this guy comes along in three years
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.260]   and Ford's, you know, moving back to Mexico,
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260]   and it's all sorts of troubles.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260]   Where did Malali go?
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260]   Well, he was-- I think he just retired.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:26.260]   There were-- I think there was a rumor that he was going to serve
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.260]   in Trump's cabinet.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.260]   I don't know if he pulled himself out of consideration,
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.260]   but I only heard the rumor briefly.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.260]   I don't know what he does right now.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.260]   Former president and CEO of Ford, he retired in 2014.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260]   He wasn't Boeing, where he had really done some amazing things
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.260]   at Boeing.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.260]   He was a really smart guy, I guess.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.260]   I guess he's just living life.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260]   The Google board of directors, that sounds--
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.260]   Oh, that's right.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.260]   He's on the Google board.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.260]   Oh, right.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.260]   Very smart guy.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.260]   Very good.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.260]   And who did a great job, and I guess his successor, not so great.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.260]   What do you think it pays to be on the Google board of directors?
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.260]   Oh, lots.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.260]   It should be on their 14--
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.260]   That's what they--
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.260]   What is it?
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.260]   Is it the 14A?
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.260]   14A?
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.260]   What is your--
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.260]   It's in your definitive proxy statement, issued once a year.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.260]   Yeah, they're K.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.260]   So let me just see.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.260]   I want to know what the board--
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.260]   90,000 to 379,000.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.260]   That's what I would have guessed.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.260]   That's a big range.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.260]   I want to guess six figures, but--
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260]   Yeah, it's good money if you can get it.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.260]   You don't work, but a few times a year.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.260]   I would believe it.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.260]   Google?
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.260]   I'll take it.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.260]   They send you a plane.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.260]   You can get a ride.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.260]   I'll do it.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.260]   Really?
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.260]   I'll just business class is fine.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.260]   I'll just do a regular--
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.260]   I'll fly commercial.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.260]   I'll do it.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.260]   Tomorrow.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.260]   Let's see.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.260]   Here we go.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.260]   We'll work on getting this accounts thing fixed.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.260]   OK.
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.060]   So, Jeff, I was wondering if maybe it's because a lot of the services Google provides to free
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.060]   people and to the free customers.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.060]   We're all free.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.060]   It involves them.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.060]   OK, but you pay for your accounts.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.060]   I know.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:18.060]   It could be that they can't-- they scan all those emails, but if you pay for it, they
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.060]   don't actually look inside your emails because corporations would be obviously mad.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.060]   So I wonder if that's one of the challenges they face when trying to divvy that up.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.060]   This is just pure speculation.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.060]   You're making excuses for the moustache.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   I'm not making excuses.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.060]   I'm just-- you know, I mean, I'm sure--
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.060]   Let me be angry, Stacey.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.060]   Let me be angry.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.060]   Yes.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.060]   I am also angry.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.060]   I have accounts and I'm also like, "Oh, I can't put you together."
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.060]   So.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.060]   Yep.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.060]   Anyway.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.060]   Anyway.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.060]   Anywho.
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:58.060]   Google's self-driving unit Waymo is worth, it turns out, Waymo.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.060]   That Waymo than any of the other big three.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.060]   More than GM.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.060]   More than Uber.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.060]   More than Tesla.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:18.060]   This is a story from a couple of days ago based on an analyst from Morgan Stanley who said
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:23.060]   that its value should be around $70 billion.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   That's more than a tenth of Alphabet's overall market value.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.060]   Do you agree with that, Ronamadios?
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.060]   That seems like a lot.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:39.060]   This does seem like Alphabet's next good business venture because this really is something--
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:44.060]   Yeah, this really is something that could change the world and Google's been doing it for longer
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.060]   than anyone else.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.060]   So, you know, just kind of naturally they're ahead of everybody else.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:55.060]   I think even who's the turncoat that went to Uber and his guest food, whatever his name
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.060]   is.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:03.900]   He recently admitted that Waymo was like five years ahead of Uber in terms of technology.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.060]   And I mean that probably lines up with when they started too.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.540]   Waymo's just the furthest ahead from everybody and they want to license it to car manufacturers
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:18.780]   and they have a ride sharing trial going on in Arizona now I think.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.180]   And it's just something where there's a--I think there's a huge market for it if you can
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.740]   get it right.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.020]   And plenty of companies will like pay for the technology or you can start your own ride
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.100]   sharing service.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.540]   They just partnered with Lyft, I think, for ride sharing service.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.660]   I'm not sure what Lyft is going to contribute to that partnership, but OK.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.900]   Look at these numbers, this is from Forbes in February.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.260]   This is the number of autonomous miles driven.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:53.460]   Waymo has driven 97% of all autonomous miles beating everybody.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:59.900]   Tesla, GM, BMW, Mercedes Benz Ford, Nissan Delphi, Bosch, by a long shot.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.900]   This is in 2016.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.620]   Yeah, Uber comes along and thinks, "Oh, we can do that."
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.620]   And look how hard it's been.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.620]   It's very intelligent.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.860]   What this number doesn't include is what they call disengagements, which is when a human driver
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.340]   has had to take over for the autonomous vehicle.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:25.380]   And Google also leads, Waymo also leads in that regard by far the fewest disengagements.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.420]   Waymo's test drivers have to disengage about once every 5,000 miles.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:40.180]   BMW, 638, Tesla, 182, Mercedes Benz once every 600-- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.140]   Mercedes Benz had 336 disengagements over 673 miles.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.580]   It's like once every two miles.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.620]   I wonder if my cruise control could match that.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.900]   Just see how straight down the road the car will go.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.580]   This doesn't include, however, autopilot miles on Tesla's, which are 200 million.
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:07.540]   I mean, Tesla's have a lot of-- Tesla has a lot of data about self-driving cars, but
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.700]   their autopilot isn't really full autonomy.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.420]   So it's not under California law.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.380]   It's not autonomous.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.380]   So in fact--
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.580]   Yeah, lots of cars have similar features.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.100]   I feel they're pretty close.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.980]   And that gets really hyped up because it's Tesla.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.700]   But Waymo has the largest self-driving fleet on Earth.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.940]   Or at least they will when they get their Arizona thing up and running.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.860]   But I think the big deal about Waymo is that they make their own hardware now.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.660]   So it's pretty easy-- well, it's relatively easy to kind of get like a self-driving car
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:46.140]   project up and running just by going to Velodyne as the company and buying their like out-of-the-box
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.020]   LiDAR solutions.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.700]   You see these on Ford cars a lot that kind of look like little Coke cans.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.340]   The new one looks like a hockey puck.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:59.260]   It's like if you look at the Prius, the first Google self-driving Prius, it had like a big
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.900]   fat like trash can on the roof.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.420]   That was another Velodyne sensor where Waymo makes like all their own hardware now.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:13.900]   And as a result, it costs them about a tenth what it costs everybody else who's here's
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.620]   some video spotted by a Mac rumors reader of the Apple Lexus self-driving car.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.780]   Apple has a fleet of five or six of these.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.780]   And yeah, see that big coffee can on the roof?
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.420]   That's the off-the-shelf LiDAR that you were talking about.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.940]   Yeah, I don't get why they identified this as an Apple car.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.020]   Yeah, it doesn't say Apple on it.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.340]   Right, and how would you ever know, unless you talk to the people or maybe they saw
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.780]   that leave Apple headquarters.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.300]   Yeah, because this is--
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.980]   This driver was particularly well dressed in life.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.900]   It was on an iPhone.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.340]   Maybe they confirmed it with Apple.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.100]   Oh, that would be called report time.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   Oh, right, and Apple.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.340]   Would you ever say anything?
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.900]   Well, I know, but you know.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:08.940]   It's using the Velodyne 64 channel LiDAR as you said, Ron.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.660]   $75,000.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.700]   Wow.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.380]   But Waymoq is making it for what?
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.380]   A tenth, they said.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.220]   But that's what Google does.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.260]   I mean, Google builds its own heart.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.620]   It figures out how something works, figures out how it can optimize it, and then boom.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.620]   Yeah, the trashcan model is really old, like a couple of years old.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.860]   So it's pretty expensive.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.940]   Velodyne has smaller, cheaper ones.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.820]   But the channel is what's important.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.620]   When they say 64 channels, like, you know, when they show you the self-driving car thing,
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.420]   they have rings around the car.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.420]   They're just like a three-scan of the--
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   Yeah, what it's seeing.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.740]   It's the channels of how many rings you get.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:51.020]   And you can make it cheaper by having less channels, because like they have robots, they
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.260]   have vacuum cleaners that work on LiDAR because they're one channel.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.660]   And you can get those for $500.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.100]   So what really matters is how many channels are you doing per like a dollar?
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.260]   Because anybody can make them cheaper.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.980]   It's going to make it cheap and good.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:11.900]   Meanwhile, Uber has pissed off Pittsburgh, which was the pilot city for its self-driving
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   vehicles.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:18.140]   This article from the Saultia Kang in the New York Times says, "Uber has reneged.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.300]   They promised free rides in the driverless vehicle."
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.780]   Well, they're not really driverless.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.220]   There's a driver, but in the self-driving cars.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.660]   Nope, they started charging for them.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.740]   It withdrew support from Pittsburgh's--
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.740]   Uber, Uber, Uber.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:36.940]   Uber is just like-- it's just a nonstop junk show, crap show.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.860]   It also withdrew support from Pittsburgh's application for a $50 million federal grant.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.820]   It hasn't created the jobs it proposed in the neighborhood that houses its autonomous
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.020]   car testing track.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.140]   Pittsburgh's pissed.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:57.260]   In fact, it's an issue in the mayoral primary, which is going on right now.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:03.340]   One of the candidates, the guy who won actually called Uber a stain on the city.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.340]   Wow, Lord.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.180]   Has Uber done any right?
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.340]   I was going to say, do we talk about-- oh, my gosh, my brain just-- oh, it's right.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.060]   Route-based pricing, group-based pricing.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.260]   Yeah, driver's real happy about that now.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.260]   No, we haven't.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.260]   Let's talk about it.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.460]   Was this discovered or announced?
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:33.340]   I think it was just covered, and then Uber confirmed it and talked about it.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:39.380]   So they're basically charging what it thinks you're willing to pay.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.500]   They have a lot of data, right?
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.820]   And they're not afraid to use it.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.300]   This is a story from Bloomberg.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:52.020]   Uber drivers have been complaining that the gap between the fair or rider pays and what
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.300]   the driver gets paid is getting wider.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.820]   Uber has finally provided an explanation according to Bloomberg.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.060]   It's charging some passengers more because it needs the money.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.660]   Didn't it lose $2 billion?
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.980]   It's a big money loser.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:15.060]   They're worth almost $70 billion, but they lose money at an almost stunning clip.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.900]   The route-based pricing charges customers based on what their data model predicts they're
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:27.700]   willing to pay, not like a cab company, which calculates it on mileage and time.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.700]   And how historically Uber had done it.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.980]   I think what's really interesting here is we don't know what data factors in.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.020]   Uber gave us some examples.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:43.580]   But what about, I think about this in the context of IoT and privacy and how much data
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.620]   we're really giving about ourselves and all sorts of crazy ways.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.020]   And I am freaked out by the idea of discriminatory pricing or maybe it's just-
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.020]   It's reverse-preparating.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.500]   You'll never get a deal anymore basically.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.580]   And so I'm like, "Oh, this is exciting."
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.780]   And Amazon does the same thing on some of its products based on-
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.780]   Amazon has surge pricing.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.100]   I don't think people know that.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.540]   And pricing will change from day to day on stuff depending on-
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.740]   Well, Amazon doesn't even search prices on books in the store, the physical stores they
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.740]   have.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   Really?
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.740]   How do you know what you're going to pay?
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.740]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.980]   Because you either check on an app on your app or you take it up and scan it because prices
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.180]   change all the time to name a pricing.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.380]   Paul Therott's daughter was at the Amazon store.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.900]   Apparently, there's one near him in Massachusetts and they won't take cash.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.740]   And she's too young to have a credit card.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.460]   Because she couldn't buy anything.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.980]   One day she'll get a chip implanted in her wrist.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:50.140]   What scares me about the Uber pricing thing is that I mix personal and business on my
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.060]   Uber account because it's part of my job.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.740]   I was an I/O last week and you pretty much have to Uber all around San Francisco.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.740]   So because I use it at work and I'm just like, "Yeah, it's a business expense, sure, whatever.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.700]   Now when I have to use Uber back home, it's going to cost me more money."
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   That's thanks.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.940]   One of the examples, Uber's head of product gave Daniel Graf gave Bloomberg.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.300]   Somebody traveling from a wealthy neighborhood to another Tony spot might be asked to pay
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.340]   more than a person heading to a poorer part of town.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.500]   What?
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.260]   I guess, hey, it's capitalism.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   Right?
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.260]   They've got the data.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.220]   The reason cab company's never did it, they just didn't know.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.700]   Which is why I'm like, imagine now if they get more data about you.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.700]   So let's say they see your 50-day data.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.700]   Oh, he's a doctor.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.700]   Yeah, he's a doctor.
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.700]   Charge him twice as much.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   Or this person really isn't going to walk or God help you.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.780]   So what's wrong with that?
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.100]   You know, in a capitalistic society, nothing.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.140]   But it does signal the end of...
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.340]   And this is something that's important for everyone to realize.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.140]   Even businesses will end up having this.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.140]   There's...
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.500]   This is how tax works.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.940]   You pay more tax if you're rich.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.940]   Well, actually you don't.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.460]   In theory, you pay more tax if you're rich.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.620]   It's the idea that you'll never get a deal.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.140]   The other issue, because people love deals.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.140]   They really do.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.940]   But the other issue is there's a definite power imbalance over who has access and control
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.940]   of your data.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.540]   He who has the data wins.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.380]   We're rapidly approaching that world.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.540]   And by the way, who has the most data?
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.540]   Google.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.540]   Google.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.540]   Yep.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.540]   More than anything.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.540]   Followed by Amazon?
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   Yeah, Amazon has a lot of data.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.820]   A commerce data.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.820]   But as we've learned...
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.820]   Facebook.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.820]   Facebook have more data than what the Amazon really...
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:46.300]   You know, I think Google gets more data than anybody because they owned a phone platform
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.300]   as well as the desktop platform.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.060]   Oh, your curiosity is all your email.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.060]   They know every...
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.060]   They got everything.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.060]   They know everything.
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.060]   Facebook is limited to what you share on Facebook.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.060]   Facebook was Amazon.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.180]   They see no one in Amazon.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.180]   I think I'd go with Facebook.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.100]   Amazon knows everything you buy if you buy everything in Amazon.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.540]   If you buy everything in Amazon.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.100]   Google will soon know more about that.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.060]   Look at Google just announced that they're ad conference.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.780]   And this is kind of the holy grail for advertisers.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.780]   Advertisers buy...
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.780]   Very much so.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.660]   Yeah, advertisers like buy ads on Twitch, for instance.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:29.420]   But what they don't know is, well, we know we give you a tracking code so we know if you
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.740]   immediately bought something because you heard an ad on Twitch, that's why we always say,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.340]   you know, use our offer code Twig.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.340]   But that doesn't...
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.460]   But if, you know, Ford used to advertise here.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.340]   What Ford would love to know is, did those ads on Twitch help sell cars at the dealership?
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:51.260]   Google says, now they will help advertisers by tracking offline credit card use to show
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.900]   that online ads work.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.940]   Now they do say they're anonymizing.
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.580]   They're double anonymizing it.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.580]   That's really good.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.580]   Twice as good.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.460]   Does that mean it takes eight pieces of data?
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.860]   Or does it take 16?
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.860]   I do.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.420]   I feel like Google's pretty good at data science.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.100]   They understand the problem with anonymizing.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.100]   However...
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.140]   That doesn't mean they don't necessarily know that we understand it.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.300]   And so they can say it's double anonymized.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.660]   And to them that means something.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.260]   And they're like, that's not very effective.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.060]   But to us we're like, whoo.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.140]   They say, "Google ad interactions will be done in a secure and privacy safe way and only
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:37.340]   report on aggregated and anonymized store sales to protect your customer data."
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.420]   So this is because they have Android Pay.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.420]   Look, they have Android.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.420]   They have Android Pay.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.100]   They have sales receipts that you get emailed.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.660]   And by the way, that's more and more of the case.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.620]   They really...Amazon's not even close.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.180]   And Facebook's even farther afield.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.060]   Because if people start...an apple, by the way, with apple pay might have more information.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.700]   But they don't have anywhere near the other stuff.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.220]   Google's the winner in this one.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.220]   It seems to me.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.660]   This is, as you said, it's the Holy Grail.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.660]   They've been wanting accountability.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.060]   I mean, it's still not going to be perfect because you might have seen five ads for cars.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.020]   How many things did I look at like cars before I finally bought?
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.020]   But that's where it's...
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.620]   How many cars do you buy with a credit card?
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.980]   Oh, I put $5,000 for the down payment.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.980]   You bet.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980]   So I got miles.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.980]   Oh, okay.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.980]   No, I'm just like, wait a second.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.980]   Who buys a car?
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.980]   They say...
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.980]   Well, now, yeah.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.860]   And so bank data, probably privacy there is probably more protected, right?
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.860]   But it's not...
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:36.860]   Because if you wrote a check...
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:44.020]   In the end, what you're going back to is you're simply saying that person X who saw this ad
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.020]   bought this thing.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.460]   We're not telling you who person X is.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.060]   We're not telling you what they bought.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.060]   We're just saying hello, advertiser.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.140]   You get extra credit.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:59.700]   The company says advertisers have measured some 5 billion store visits through ad words
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.500]   in the past three years.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.620]   Deep learning is helping it predict store visits in historically difficult to measure
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.500]   densely packed places like multi-storey malls.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.740]   Oh, Tango could help here, couldn't it?
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.540]   Well, you also just have the phone telling you you're there.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540]   Right.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.060]   You have the location, then you have the payoff of the action made a purchase and you have
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.820]   what ad they saw on what media.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.020]   They say they can track...
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.020]   Get this.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:30.060]   About 70% of all credit and debit card transactions in the US.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.060]   Jesus.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.620]   All the Germans are just going to completely freak out.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.380]   Hey, but she's learning is powerful.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:42.220]   It should also freak out Facebook and Amazon, everybody else because freaks me out because
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.140]   I can't sell an ad that can give you that kind of information.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.940]   So it's exactly it freaks out media.
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.460]   That's who it's going to mostly freak out is because we can't promise that.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.780]   That's a cost per sale ad.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.460]   And you can sell that.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.380]   Oh, you can sell that.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:06.660]   Although a savvy advertiser, I would be quick to point out, will value the unique relationship
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:10.140]   that a podcaster can bring with its audience.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.140]   And you could trust.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:15.340]   You could never get from an ad word banner ad and the trust.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.340]   Absolutely.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.340]   Yes.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.340]   Yes.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   That's true.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.820]   Well, they could hear it about...
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.780]   They said they could hear about something from you, right?
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.780]   Oh, Leo said this.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.420]   Let me Google it and see.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.780]   And then boom, Google claims it.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.780]   You're done.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.780]   That's okay.
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.780]   The advertisers know.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.780]   You know what I love?
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:41.060]   My favorite thing is when an advertiser comes to us after a long ad campaign and says, "Oh,
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.060]   it says..."
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.060]   And this happens all the time.
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.060]   You know, it didn't work.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.060]   We cancel.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.060]   And then they come crawling back three months later when they realized their sales have
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.740]   plummeted because it was working.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.740]   They just didn't...
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.460]   We're able to measure the accountability.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.460]   Right.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.460]   Someday that'll happen.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:03.300]   No, it has happened once or twice.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.620]   Google attribution is what they call this.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.100]   This is a big deal in the industry.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.100]   Is it?
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.100]   Big deal.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.460]   I read it.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.180]   And only Google can do this.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.340]   Nobody else can do this.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.180]   I mean, Amazon could do it in a small...
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.180]   Apple has that...
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.740]   Other companies could do the small universe that they operate in, but can Apple claim
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.060]   to be able to seat 70% of all credit card transactions?
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.380]   Well, and also how many ads does Google see?
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.540]   So if you just simply are using the Google ad ecosystem, they see most ads.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.340]   They know who clicked on that ad or who saw that.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:45.460]   Oh, here's the other thing part is it's no longer pay per click, right?
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.460]   Paper sales.
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.820]   So whether you click or not, doesn't matter so much.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:53.980]   That could change the essence of what ads look like, how they operate.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:37:00.780]   So remember Google announced this in a forum where the audience was very receptive to
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.780]   advertisers.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.660]   This was not in the I/O keynote.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.660]   This was not an I/O.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.020]   This was later.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.620]   But some of us are looking at this.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.100]   This is the slide they put up, Google attribution.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.260]   Google attribution takes in data across adwords, Google analytics, and double clicks search
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.100]   without any additional tagging.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.860]   They don't have to.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.020]   They know all about you.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.020]   Now we're starting.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.860]   This is what people have been telling me for a long time about Google.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.340]   Now we're seeing the fruits of all of this, right?
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.340]   For instance, the robots, you know, the capture thing.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.420]   I am not a robot.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:42.340]   That's disappearing now because they started with just the checkbox.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.220]   Now it's completely disappearing because Google knows who you are.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.780]   If you're using your computer and your browser, they know exactly who you are and that you're
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.100]   not a robot.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   They have enough.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.220]   They've been collecting enough signals for long enough to know exactly.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.220]   You're right.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.220]   I get it.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.220]   Sometimes I get a different experience.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.220]   I'll turn on in convening.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.220]   You'll see it all right.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.220]   Well, so that's again why I thought I/O was actually really interesting.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.260]   I was really good keynote and everyone else was like, blah, blah, blah, boring.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.100]   Google is mastering context because it's applying machine learning.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.020]   So it's applying.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.980]   Notice one of the things it's looking at is nearby location data to get data about people
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.740]   visiting stores.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.900]   That's contextual information just being thrown from your phone.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.900]   I mean, that's-
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.900]   It's what we always thought.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.780]   It's what we always thought that the data smog is coming off of you all the time would
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:39.660]   become more and more valuable with modeling and artificial intelligence and deep data.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.660]   And now-
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.660]   It's just not valuable to you.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.660]   We're entering that world.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.900]   Well, but you're giving it off and somebody's making capitalizing on it.
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   Right.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.900]   Yikes.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:54.100]   Oh, so before we move to another topic, yeah, I'll do an ad, but go ahead.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.740]   I did do a correction first.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.740]   Please.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.980]   So I stupidly googled, you know, director compensation.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.420]   That means people if you're the director level at Google.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:10.900]   So I'll allow the when he was a player to the board in 2014, he will receive an initial
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:16.180]   grant, initial grant of $1 million in Google stock, an annual equity award of $350,000
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.500]   with a $75,000 cash pertainer and reimbursement of expenses.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.500]   Google.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.740]   I'll do it for last.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.740]   Yeah, really.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.740]   Cut it in half.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.620]   I'm a bargain at far less.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.780]   I know a number of people who serve on boards.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.260]   That's a very, you know, because nobody does just one board.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.780]   You do four or five.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.140]   You're making a couple of a million a year.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.500]   It's hardly working.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.700]   It's a great gig.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.420]   Unfortunately, you have to be a successful senior first.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.940]   Yeah, I know.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.780]   But don't they need more professors and podcasts on boards to represent the real people?
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.300]   The people, the people, the people.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:57.380]   I don't think I don't think the professors and media professors represent the people
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.380]   at this moment in time.
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:02.900]   They do stay see a lot more than IOT podcasters.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.020]   I am not putting myself out there and as a board.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.460]   Although as a woman, I would argue that I could do I could do fairly well.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:15.100]   I would actually put you on a board because yes, you represent the distaff side.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.100]   Awesome.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   All right.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.100]   I don't know.
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.940]   Is that a I bet you should probably look up the etymology of that because it's probably
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.580]   incredibly insulting.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.580]   You know what Leo?
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.100]   It doesn't matter.
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.180]   You just know that I'm going to be that way no matter what.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.180]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:36.420]   It basically I mean, oh, oh, it is is incredibly insulting.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.420]   Yes, it is.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.140]   I mean, I'm like, oh, I'm not going to tell it.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:45.260]   It's a stick or spindle onto which Wooler Flax is wound for spinning or of or concerning
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.340]   women.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.100]   You can call me hysterical later and we'll call it.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.900]   We'll call it a draw or above.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.980]   I am such an old school fart now.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.740]   I didn't I didn't used to be this way.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.940]   I used to be liberated and woke.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:04.020]   No, no, I'm using words like this, staff.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.380]   Okay.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.500]   I didn't mean to refer to you as a sticker spindle into which Wooler Flax is wound for
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   spinning.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.900]   You could add it to your list of things you shouldn't call Stacy.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.900]   Not say.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   Honey, Stacy.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.900]   Stacey.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.900]   Yes, honey.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.540]   Is that and never never referred to opening your kimono.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.180]   Oh, it is wrong.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.700]   We're blowing smoke up your skirt.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.500]   That's only that's very wrong.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:36.700]   How about the camel's nose under the tent and can you say that?
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   I think that's okay.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.540]   I'm just like, Hey, can we talk about Google now?
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.540]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.540]   I'm just teasing.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.540]   We're going to take a break.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.500]   Ronamario is great to have him from ours.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.660]   Literally, the place I go first every day for the best tech reporting out there.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.580]   Ron does a great job covering Android, but all of the R's team is fantastic.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.820]   Just hike.
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.740]   You're the New York Times of tech of tech sites.
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.740]   Really?
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.740]   Seriously.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.740]   Great stuff.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.260]   Yeah, boys love DARS.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.460]   And also with us, it's of course, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.460]   He's not.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.740]   What is the opposite of this staff?
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.740]   He's the opposite of this staff.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:25.660]   He's on staff and Stacy Higginbotham, who is just great and puts up with me.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.260]   Forgiving and forgiving.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.260]   Thank you.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.260]   Thank you.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.860]   I very gracious.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.380]   You're very gracious.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:39.060]   So I learned the other day that I'm a man and I have wet earwax, but it's just a few
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.260]   of the things I learned from 23 and me.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.740]   I love 23 and me.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:50.620]   It's an online genetic analysis company that helps you understand your 23 pairs of chromosomes.
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.540]   That's where the name comes from.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.860]   It's your DNA.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.860]   I should log in.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.220]   Let me log into my 23 and me because I can show you some of the things that I know about
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.860]   myself, my ethnicity.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.260]   I found relatives, which is super cool.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:10.660]   I found a second cousin because they do what they do is they among other things, they will
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.540]   match you up with other 23 and me and you have to give them permission.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.420]   Of course, you have total control of your privacy, but they'll match you up with other
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:23.860]   23 and me customers who have gene similar enough that they must be related and they
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.180]   will say, "Oh, this person, this is mine.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.500]   See DNA relatives.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.420]   This person's probably related to you.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.860]   So cool.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.980]   So Anthony Jacoby is a second cousin and you know what?
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.060]   I know he is because that's my grandmother's maiden name.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:44.580]   He's then not awesome and it's based on so all you do, it's very simple.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.260]   They send you a little vial and you spit into it.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.500]   I mean, it's not a blood draw or anything like that.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:55.700]   It's very, very easy to do.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.260]   They will give you reports like your ancestry reports.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.940]   A lot of people love these.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.820]   Yeah, see, order, spit and discover.
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.740]   That's the three steps.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.740]   Expectorate.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.940]   And by the way, the other thing is I did this a long time ago, maybe a couple of years
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.260]   ago, but there's always new stuff in here.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:22.020]   For instance, I just am learning now about my maternal haplogruth group, which is U5A1B1.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.620]   So I can see, look at this is so cool.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.540]   Migrations of my maternal line.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.940]   This is my mom.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:34.020]   You know, this is my mother's side.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.620]   I can go back to 180,000 years ago.
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:49.660]   We came from central East Africa, migrated up to into the Middle East and then up and
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.700]   into Europe, 47,000 years ago.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.340]   That's from my haplogroup.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.340]   That is fascinating.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.420]   You can learn more about it.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.220]   It's one of the oldest haplogroups in Europe.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:05.580]   The common ancestor of U5A1 was a woman who likely lived in Europe during the Ice Age,
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.660]   17,000 years ago.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.220]   That's my great, great, great something grandma.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.740]   It's not completely uncommon.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.620]   About one in 169, 23 ME customers are in the same group.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.020]   So is the cheddar man.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:25.060]   I'm very proud to be related to the cheddar man.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.300]   This is England's oldest skeleton.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.700]   I was like, you're related to a cheese monger?
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.020]   This is hysterical.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.700]   His maternal haplogroup also U5A.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.700]   What?
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:44.060]   Anyway, you could have to do this with your kids because the educational part of this
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:45.460]   is fantastic.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:52.540]   You also get traits, things like facial features, you know, which based, you know, I have a
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.820]   cleft chin, cheap dimples, a unit brow, and a widow's peak.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.620]   That's right.
[00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.420]   Nailed it.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.860]   And you can see what ear lobe type you have.
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:06.620]   All of this from Spittin' into a little vial is 23 ME.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:12.060]   75 online genetic reports, categories like ancestry, wellness, traits, even health.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:14.460]   You can learn more about who you are.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.420]   Oh, you want to know if I have any Neanderthals?
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.060]   Sure you do.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.420]   Do you have any Neanderthal in you?
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.420]   Would you know that?
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.300]   Where do I find the Neanderthal?
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.660]   It's probably in the ancestry report yet.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.140]   Oh, the ancestry report is even better now.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.500]   It's going to be the ancestry, the ethnicity of the...
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.500]   Isn't this cool?
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   My numbers.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.460]   How many relatives I have in here are the breaking numbers?
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:42.860]   So I'm actually a little less Neanderthal than most 623 million customers.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.020]   That's a little bit more polished and refined.
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:50.540]   However, I'm in seventh place out of my family and friends, which is funny.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.860]   Yeah, that's what I love about this.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.540]   You constantly get new information all the time.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.380]   As we learn more and more about what this means, there's a carrier status.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.900]   23 means carrier status reports meet FDA requirements.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.060]   This is what we were talking about.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.580]   So you can find out if you're a carrier for certain inherited conditions, things like
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.740]   cystic fibrosis, hereditary hearing loss.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.260]   Oh, I don't want to look at that one.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.060]   I know I'm losing my hearing.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.140]   Understand what makes you you.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.180]   It's just fascinating.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:25.300]   But over 75 genetic reports and start exploring your DNA today, 23andme.com/twit.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:30.860]   That's the number 23andme23andme.com/twit.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.540]   That's a lot of fun.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.420]   Isn't there a Google connection with 23andme?
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.420]   Isn't it?
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.340]   Well, it's familiar with us.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.340]   It's just key.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.340]   It's just key.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   And what you're...
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.340]   That's right.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.140]   X-wife founded...No, Sister-Mong?
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.580]   X-wife of Larry.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.940]   And Esther's daughter.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.420]   Esther's daughter.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.060]   And Susan's sister.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.060]   Yes.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:03.820]   The wishes family is all 23andme report in and of itself.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.660]   Because Susan Wojciecki runs YouTube, Esther's their mom who rented...and this is where the
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.660]   connection comes from.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.940]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.820]   But she rented her garage to Larry and Sergey.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.100]   She runs the journalism...
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.420]   Easy and journalism program at Palo Alto Hot.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:18.420]   Oh, neat.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   She's...
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.420]   Esther is just the greatest.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.420]   Esther is just wonderful.
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.180]   I love that whole family.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.260]   Oh, they're amazing.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:31.700]   So I also on 23andme, in the research area, now that it has my genes, it asks me all these
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.700]   questions.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.300]   Like when the latest is...when a mosquito bites me, how big is the...
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   Oh.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.300]   Is that cool?
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.300]   Right?
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:44.740]   So I spent...I got fascinated with this and I spent like two hours just answering questions.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.300]   How often do you wear earplugs to help you get to sleep?
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   That's neat.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.300]   No.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.020]   By the way, I've just been handed this.
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.300]   Distaff is female Agnet.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:01.620]   AGNATE Agnet is male, the male version of Distaff.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.460]   Thank you very much to our research team.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.460]   For coming.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.700]   And what does that mean?
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.700]   Like this deaf means Agnet?
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.700]   Spindle.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.180]   Spindle and Agnet means...does that have another word?
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:16.100]   A person descended from the same male ancestors and another specified or implied person, especially
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.460]   through the male line.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.580]   See, as usual, guys, we get the great...
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.580]   Because we own the world.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:24.900]   You might as well just get used to it.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.900]   It's all about us.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:27.900]   Yancei has...
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.900]   She makes to differ.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:29.900]   Yeah, but she makes to differ.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.900]   Ha ha ha.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.900]   And she...
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.460]   But the women can slap our hands away when we get off Air Force One.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.780]   Everybody perfect...oh, wow.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   I know.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.340]   Oh, wow.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:47.020]   Everybody knows that men are along for the ride that is women who are in charge and we
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   acknowledge that.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.020]   Please.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.020]   No.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.020]   No.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.020]   No.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.020]   No.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.020]   Let's not go here.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.020]   No.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.020]   Nice trial, but you ain't buying it.
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.020]   Watch.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:58.020]   I know.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.820]   I know a genetic marker that's going to get Stacey Goan.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:08.100]   45 teraplops tensor flow processors.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.100]   TPU.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.100]   Come on.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.020]   You know you're excited.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.620]   You know you're excited.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.620]   I am.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:20.100]   This is what...I thought this was super exciting from Google I/O.
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.260]   So I was like, everyone's like, blah, blah, blah, no hardware.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.860]   I was like, what are you talking about?
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:24.860]   Very exciting.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.300]   They introduced the awesome thing.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.940]   And so, can we talk about machine learning and the AlphaGo game?
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.940]   Because...
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:31.940]   Yes.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.740]   I think now the AlphaGo is currently beating the best Go player in the world.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.700]   And for those of you who are like, wait, didn't it already do this?
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:45.540]   The cool thing about this version of AlphaGo is they re-architected it so it learned without
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.540]   humans.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:52.460]   So it taught itself using only machine-machined-play games.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.980]   So that's why this is pretty freaking cool.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.900]   So I have only...
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:02.300]   The first round went to AlphaGo by the smallest possible margin, half a point, although you
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:07.140]   can't conclude much from that because AlphaGo is designed to just win.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.180]   It can win by this.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.340]   It doesn't need to win big.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.340]   It just wins.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:16.900]   Kije is the...19 years old.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.140]   He's considered the best...I know he's Chinese.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:23.740]   He's considered the best Go player in the world.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:28.180]   Now what's interesting, and I don't have to confirm this.
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.460]   Let me look at the DeepMind channel and see if there's been another game.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.380]   Is there a second match already?
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.380]   I guess not.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.900]   Yeah, I didn't hear anything about a second match yesterday.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.380]   I thought there was.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:46.020]   I think it's best of five and they're going to do team games too, which sounds really
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.020]   neat.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.820]   But I didn't hear anything about anybody winning or losing last night.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:54.100]   Additionally, I'm a chess player and of course we chess players learned that machines were
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.860]   better than us a long time ago.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:03.980]   The Gary Kespart of the world champion was beaten handily by Deep Blue.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:08.060]   AlphaGo is taking on a much more difficult challenge.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.660]   Go has many more variations.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.100]   It is a very subtle game.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:18.300]   What's interesting, I don't know if this is true or apocryphal, but I've been told.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.860]   I saw a story yesterday that the Chinese government was blocking this stream.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:27.820]   Anybody in China to know that the best player in the world, a Chinese man, was being beaten
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:28.820]   by a machine.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.100]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.860]   You could see it's just a gripping exhibition.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.980]   Just non-stop action.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.100]   The commentator is pretty cool though.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.860]   It's Michael Redmond doing a lot of the commentary.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.580]   He did it for the first round of games.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.780]   Even if you know nothing about Go, which I don't, he did a pretty good job of kind of
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:55.620]   cluing people in about what is special about certain moves and he'll regularly tally up
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.700]   points and tell you who's winning.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.500]   It's fun to watch for a bit at least.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.860]   No, I completely agree.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.980]   If you were to watch the whole thing, it would be six hours.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.700]   They each have three hours to play the game.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.700]   That's a lot.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.540]   I would imagine that Google does a little faster.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:20.580]   Yeah, you can see the timer at some point and AlphaGo had like two hours left when the
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.660]   other guy had none.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:30.220]   I think out of courtesy, purely out of courtesy, AlphaGo is taking one minute of move.
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.340]   I don't know if it's actually using all that time.
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.940]   It could be having a cigarette, wandering around, drinking some juice.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.900]   It continuously calculates even when it's not its own turn.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:46.060]   It's just going on and crushing possibilities and just on and on and on.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:52.780]   Yeah, you can see two hours left for AlphaGo and 39 minutes left for Kudji or how are you
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:53.780]   saying that?
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:54.780]   But yeah.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:59.780]   You can't really, and by the way, that you can't underestimate that because time pressure
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.540]   is a killer.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:05.420]   As you get short on time, you will lose if you run out of time.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:10.820]   Because you get short on time, you just don't have the luxury of spending some time thinking
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:12.620]   about your move.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:16.660]   The goal of the game is to occupy territory by surrounding the other players' pieces.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.260]   You play white and black.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.260]   It is a big board.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:21.340]   There's a lot going on.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.660]   It's an ancient game with huge amounts of subtly.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:30.140]   I played it, but it completely defeats me.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.900]   I was a pretty good chess player, but Go is another level entirely.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.900]   It's an amazing...
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:42.220]   It's amazing hearing some of the stuff Redmond says about Go in the last year since AlphaGo
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.540]   started.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.780]   It's already changing the game.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:51.540]   Even the guy that was playing AlphaGo changed his playstyle and was learning from AlphaGo
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.100]   already.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:55:00.260]   It's amazing how receptive everyone is to the different playstyle of a computer.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.340]   Which is different from chess.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.540]   The chess community really doesn't like how computers play.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:09.380]   They don't play like a human.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.580]   I guess in theory Go is completely deterministic and calculable.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.020]   Chess is much more so.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:18.500]   Both are incredibly complex.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:23.980]   The computer almost feels like a brute force machine when it's playing chess.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:31.100]   From what I hear these Go players say, AlphaGo is in some way making something beautiful.
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:35.140]   There's an aesthetic to what it's doing that is impressing the Go community in a very different
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.740]   way than the chess community.
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.580]   Yeah, it reacted to Deep Blue.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.700]   Maybe the different ways they were.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.420]   Because chess was a brute force understanding of the rules and that's it.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:50.300]   That goes learning from people and creating its own rules originally.
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.180]   I don't think you can brute force Go.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.780]   I think there's too many possibilities.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.500]   It's too complicated.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.020]   You have to really understand what's going on.
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.540]   Maybe it is more artistic.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.620]   We live in interesting times, don't we?
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:10.220]   I was like, I can play clue in Jin Rummy.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.220]   Neither artistically.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.220]   No.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.500]   Lisa always beats me in Jin Rummy.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:16.500]   She has card sense.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.820]   It's really interesting actually.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.500]   She's very good at numbers.
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.580]   Is she a card counter?
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.860]   She could probably.
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:27.700]   But I think it's a gut.
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:30.340]   It's really interesting to watch her play because she always wins even though it's a
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.260]   game of luck, right?
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.340]   But she always wins.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:38.980]   I think she really understands at a deep level what's going on.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.580]   I'm paying attention.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.740]   It's not Go Fish.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.220]   Although I am very good at Go Fish.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.380]   Did you read Steve Kovac?
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.540]   Good to know.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.420]   Stay away from me on the Go Fish.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:57.260]   Did you read Steve Kovac's interesting article about A-Tap?
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:00.980]   Google's Advanced Technology Group.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.180]   I did not get a chance to, but I wanted to.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.780]   I had marked it.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.780]   Well, good for you.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:10.140]   I was excited that we were talking about it on the show.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.980]   That saves me for reading it.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:17.020]   Well, what's interesting is it's very much changed how it's run.
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:24.980]   As much of, I think much of Alphabet has under the stern gaze of CFO Ruth Porat.
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:30.300]   Somebody, Steve quotes somebody involved with A-Tap who said, "We're not pirates anymore.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.180]   We're lowering the flag."
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.860]   Steve writes, "Instead of dreaming up far-fetched research and development projects, the A-Tap
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:46.100]   group now functions more like a product division tasked with shipping market-ready goods."
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:51.220]   A-Tap announced so many things that never really came to market.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:55.580]   The one thing that made it was Project Tango.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:58:01.220]   I think they did the Motorola Spotlight videos where you can hold your phone up.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:02.220]   I love the spotlight story.
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.220]   Oh, that's what they were.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:04.220]   The spotlight story.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.220]   They came in.
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:09.580]   Jekar came out, but I don't know if it's actually for sale.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.460]   So that's part of the Loom Weave Trio.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:18.460]   Weave is different.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:22.220]   Well, there's Brillo, there's Weave, there's Loom, and there's a card.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:26.580]   Is there all home automation thingies, right?
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.860]   No.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.220]   Weave and Brillo, Brillo became Android Things.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.860]   Weave is still a protocol and that is home automation.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:39.660]   But Jekar was weaving conductive fibers in the fabrics.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:40.660]   Oh, that's right.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.660]   It was a touch screen.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.060]   It was a touch screen and a jean jacket, basically.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.260]   Well, a touch surface, not a screen.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.780]   That's dopey.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.780]   But other than that, they've had like five or six things that they've announced and demoed
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.700]   and never became projects, never became like products.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:01.340]   They have the little, like a radar, a tiny radar sensor that can like live on your wrist
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:06.540]   and you're supposed to be able to like gesture above a smartwatch.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:13.540]   What else?
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:19.540]   There was Project Vault, which was like a little micro SD card with a tiny computer on it that would have like its own secure storage that you could control access to.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:29.540]   There was Project Abacus, which used like the camera and location and your typing style and all sorts of stuff to like identify the userless.
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.540]   Like rather than a fingerprint.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:40.540]   This would blaze up all of your phone sensors and use everything possible to try and identify you, which sounds like a huge battery drain.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:45.540]   Yeah, but you wouldn't have to put your, do a fingerprint because you would be authenticated just by using the device.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:48.540]   Yeah, like continuous authentication.
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:52.540]   But actually launching this stuff hasn't really happened.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.540]   Remember Project ARA?
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.540]   Everybody loved this?
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.540]   I thought it was dope.
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.540]   You didn't think it was dopey.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.540]   Rick Osterlo killed that.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.540]   So Rick now is the man not in charge of ATAP, but the boss of the person in charge of ATAP.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.540]   Rick, of course, he's in charge of all hardware.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.540]   And of course he came.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.540]   Rick, where's my new Chromebook?
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:18.540]   He came from Motorola where he was very good, I think, did a good job with the Moto X.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.540]   But he killed ARA, he said no.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:24.540]   Maybe they're going to, yeah, where is your new Chromebook?
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:29.540]   You're going to get the Google, I mean, the Samsung Plus Pro?
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.540]   The Pro?
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.540]   Return Plus.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.540]   Yeah, the Pro is coming out now.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.540]   It was pokey.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.540]   The Pro is coming out.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.540]   I remember you said the Pro is not going to be that much faster.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.540]   Well, that's my guess.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.540]   I think it might be.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.540]   It's an Intel chip instead of an ARM chip.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.540]   That's the big difference.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.540]   Oh, so it's a little faster, but they need to get the software in order.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   And it's still got a launch with the software being beta and still not really.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.540]   You're talking about the Android store, the Play Store.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.540]   So, I mean, yeah, sorry.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.540]   It still doesn't seem that great.
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.540]   There's still working on all of that.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.540]   Apparently getting Android up and running on Chromebooks is very good.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.540]   Apparently, among things, Steve did some great reporting.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.540]   Steve Kovecke is some great reporting thing.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:16.540]   Among things that they're working on right now at ATAP, they did mention the Jacar jacket
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.540]   that Levi's is doing.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.540]   That was their first real standalone project.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.540]   It's supposed to launch this spring, but they hope it'll get out by the fall.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:32.540]   They're also working on a handheld device based on the concept of effective computing
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.540]   as an affect, as an emotion.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:41.540]   A discipline focused on creating gadgets that can interpret and respond to human emotions.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.540]   Aha.
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:49.540]   One source referred to the project as similar to a smartphone, but without a screen.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.540]   These are crazy ideas.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.540]   They're not necessarily good ideas.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:02:00.540]   Well, you know, free scale had a series of sensors that they could use in a software package
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:07.540]   that ran on top of them that let you that could tell the emotions of people like from their thoughts.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.540]   Sounds like Microsoft Bob.
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.540]   I see you're crying.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.540]   Would you like me to write a suicide note for you?
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.540]   That'd be useful.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:19.540]   Or Facebook's sentiment analysis.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.540]   Oh, you want to talk about that one?
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.540]   Holy cow.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:23.540]   Let's take a break.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:28.540]   This one, this is going to get me angry, but we will have that.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.540]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.540]   You don't get a Leo ramp very often.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:40.540]   There's two random subjects today, net neutrality and this Facebook study.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.540]   I'll let Stacy take that one.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.540]   Jacob Otham is here.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.540]   Her podcast, Stacy on IOT, is with Kevin Tofel.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.540]   You can find it at IOTpodcast.com.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:54.540]   She also does newsletters and is on the Twitter @Kigastacy.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.540]   We're on a Modio from ours.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540]   Technica where he covers Android.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.540]   And I bet you get to cover anything you want because you're just the greatest.
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.540]   Yes, we should still talk about car stuff.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:05.540]   I just covered that.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.540]   We're not done with cart stuff and he's got more to say about that good.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:12.540]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis, we didn't expect you today.
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.540]   You got home early?
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.540]   No, I was always supposed to be in here.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.540]   I think actually, oh, no, I know what happened.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.540]   I was going to be in Ukraine right now, but I didn't go.
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.540]   Okay.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.540]   That's a Crimea.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:25.540]   True.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.540]   Are sure.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.540]   Hey, you know why I'm a little feisty today?
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.540]   I got a good night's sleep on my Casper mattress.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.540]   That's why you cannot downplay the vat.
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.540]   How you about that?
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.540]   A master.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.540]   You are a master.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.540]   You cannot downplay the importance of a good night's sleep.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.540]   I think we know now that that is a big part of overall health, right?
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:51.100]   Not only do you just feel bad if you didn't get a good night's sleep, but really it can
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.100]   impact your physical health.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.700]   It can make you sick.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.980]   So get a great mattress.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:01.940]   A mattress obsessively designed and made in the United States by Casper made of supportive
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:06.700]   memory phones for a sleep surface that's just the right sink and just the right bounce.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:11.700]   I don't know.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:16.700]   But at the same time you want support for your back and it does both.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:22.700]   And because it's breathable, it sleeps cool and you do not want a hot night's sleep.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.980]   You want a cool night's sleep in it, regulating your temperatures at night.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.980]   The science is showing.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:34.700]   Scientists are showing a lot of research that that is a big part of overall sleep hygiene.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.700]   The Casper mattress is going to last a long time.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.260]   It's going to give you the support you want.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.260]   There's no springs.
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.900]   That means no lumps, just comfort.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:47.660]   And you can buy it online easily and risk free because I know what you're thinking.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.980]   You're saying, but if I buy online, how do I try before I buy?
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.900]   Well, I'll tell you, everybody knows trying a mattress in a mattress store is not any
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.580]   way to try anything.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.980]   So get the Casper mattress.
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.140]   It comes in this great compact little box.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:06.900]   You open it up and smells fresh and clean, comfortable as can be.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.220]   And then get this.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:12.300]   You have a hundred nights to try it.
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:17.380]   A hundred nights, if at any time delivery is free and if at any time during the 100 day
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.300]   period you say, yeah, I don't like it, they will come and get it and refund you every
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:23.660]   penny.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:28.460]   You can't beat that free shipping and free returns in the US and Canada.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.340]   Get your Casper mattress today.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:33.620]   Really affordable because they eliminate the middleman.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.300]   It makes it easy.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:40.340]   Save an additional $50 on the mattress purchase too when you go to Casper.com/twig.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.140]   Please do that for us, will you?
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:48.780]   Use the promo code TWIG, Casper.com/twig, promo code twig, terms and conditions apply.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.100]   $50 off your brand new mattress.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.220]   You're going to love it.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.700]   It makes you want to go to bed on time every night.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.940]   I know I'm this way and I know everybody listening this week.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:07.220]   We're so excited about things in life and they just get one more episode of the wire.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.020]   I just one more page of Reddit.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:13.380]   I just one, can I play one more game of Candy Crush?
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.300]   But no, no, you won't do that because your mattress is so, so, so comfortable.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.500]   You say, I can't wait to go to bed tonight.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.100]   Oh, it feels so good.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.100]   Casper.com/twig.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.980]   And don't forget that offer code twig.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.140]   Or $50 off.
[01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.020]   Rana, Mottio, what did you write about?
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:36.700]   What did you do this time?
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.340]   I spent the last, like, year probably looking at car infotainment systems.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:47.620]   So this is like the screens that are built into your car dashboard and just kind of like
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.460]   the general mess of the industry there.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:59.380]   I feel like it's a lot like the smartphone market when it first started where you have
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:04.340]   these companies that weren't making computers suddenly have suddenly find themselves like
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.180]   having to make computers.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.220]   And they're not like super great at it.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:14.620]   So the question is when will like the real software companies move in and start making
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:21.020]   car software and Google actually announced that at Google I/O this week where they showed
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:26.380]   off Android Automotive which is an operating system that is not Android Auto.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.980]   This is not the, your phone in your face on a screen.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.540]   This is your phone running the car.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.540]   Right.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:36.660]   Android Auto runs on your smartphone and uses the car screen as like an external touch
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:41.620]   screen monitor, basically, where this is, yeah, this is exactly a copy of the phone model
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:48.180]   where Google sells or whatever licenses, the software to OEMs and they integrate it into
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.180]   their hardware.
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.540]   And in this case, the hardware is a car.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:54.140]   So a lot of cars use QNX which is owned by Blackberry.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.500]   Ford used Microsoft car for a long time for its Ford sink and Ford touch.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.180]   But they switched to QNX with Sync 3.
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.180]   Right.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.900]   So is, so this competes with QNX then?
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:11.260]   Yes, but also in the car market, some companies use Linux which is almost always terrible because
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.260]   you have to do a lot of work to make Linux be good in a car.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.660]   And there, and as you say, they're not good at software, they're car companies.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.660]   Right.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.500]   Some cars right now use Android.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:26.020]   And this is companies like Honda and Hyundai.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:31.700]   And this shows exactly why Google needs to be involved because Honda in their 2017 car
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.380]   ships Android 4.2.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:34.380]   Right.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:38.420]   But they use it, in other words, they use it like say Amazon uses it.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:44.460]   They use AOSP as the base for their car software, which they make themselves.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.820]   But you know, that's, I'm not surprised to hear that's KitKat.
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:52.340]   I'm not surprised because what is the development cycle for cars?
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.340]   It's years.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.340]   Yes.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.340]   It's like five years.
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.340]   Everything takes five years.
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:01.620]   And I looked at these cars like they were computers, which car journalists usually don't
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620]   do.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:08.100]   So I like figured out what SOC was in them and what software they ran and stuff like that.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.700]   And yeah, everything is three years old.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:15.260]   Like these are all T-GRA 3 Nvidia processors from 2011.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.900]   It's almost like universally three year old or five year old.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:19.980]   There's good reason for that.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.180]   For one, they've got to certify it.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:27.180]   But two, you can't just put a, you wouldn't just put an Android device in a car.
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.580]   There's security issues, safety issues.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.660]   There's distract driver distraction issues.
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.660]   This is non-trivial.
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:39.980]   I mean, you can talk about security issues, but Honda also ships a web browser from Tony
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:43.500]   and left like the AOSP web browser.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.380]   And I was trying it and like it won't even render like ours, Technica, because it's
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.140]   so old.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:53.260]   Please don't put a browser in a car for any reason anyway.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.260]   And oh, Hyundai's worst.
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.540]   They should ban your 2.3 gingerbread.
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.540]   What?
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:09:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.540]   Wow.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:03.180]   But these are, I presume, heavily patched, right?
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.700]   They're heavily modified.
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.700]   I don't think they're patched.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.700]   I mean, the web browser is from 2011.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.700]   Like it's not.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.700]   Right.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   They didn't up to it.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.700]   Update that.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:16.780]   So who's going to use Android automotive?
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.980]   It's Aldi and Volvo.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:19.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.580]   And yeah, the big deal about Google being involved is at number one, you get up-to-date
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.580]   Android software.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:31.940]   These were all running Android 7.0 and they're going to be upgraded to Android O before release.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.660]   And then the other thing is you get Google apps like all of these cars had Google Maps
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:42.420]   on board, which is amazing because everybody's building infotainment system is horrible.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.020]   But that was the other takeaway.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:51.380]   Like none of the car companies really want to do internet-driven maps.
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:56.620]   So what you end up with is totally local stuff, usually from here maps, which used to
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.580]   be owned by Nokia and it's now owned by like Audi and BMW and somebody else.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:09.380]   My old Audi, my 20, I want to say 13 Audi, maybe it's older than that, had Google Earth
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.380]   as the, but the--
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.380]   Yes.
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:19.220]   Those were the ones with the, did you have a digital gauge and then have like a screen
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.900]   directly where the speedometer usually is?
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.420]   No, this was on the side of Google.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:25.420]   The Audi--
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.420]   It was an Audi A.
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.580]   Yeah, I like what Audi's done.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:34.980]   And now the Tesla, my Tesla has, I don't know what, Google Maps, because it has satellite
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.540]   imagery as well as street-engie from Google Maps.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:40.820]   But I'm not clear whether it gets its nav.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:44.820]   So you can have the map and then there's something that does the turn-by-turn, which could be
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.620]   Google or could be third-party.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.900]   And then there's something that's points of interest and then does it get updated or
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.540]   not as another matter?
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.860]   So it's complicated, right?
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.900]   Yeah, Tesla is another Linux-based one.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:00.300]   It uses Google Maps, but it seems it's not the same as Google Maps on your phone.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.860]   It seems like it's old.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:06.380]   It doesn't seem like it gets live traffic because it's different than your phone.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.860]   Maybe it's delayed live traffic and the directions are different.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:11.580]   Like everything's different.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.020]   If you just hold up a phone and compare, everything's different between Google Maps
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:20.020]   on a Tesla and on a phone, probably because they don't want to use that much internet
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.020]   data.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.020]   Right.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.020]   But Google Maps--
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:27.660]   They build LTE into the car as did Audi.
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.820]   But you don't pay money for it a month?
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:31.820]   Tesla you don't.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.820]   Audi, I did.
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.700]   How do you get like a year free, but then you pay?
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:41.900]   Tesla probably doesn't want to use a ton of data because they're paying for that.
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:49.300]   But the official Google Blessed Android software had real Google Maps.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:54.180]   It's very heavily based on Android Auto, but kind of expanded to be a full operating system.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:58.580]   So Google Maps, you get all of the Android Auto apps, which is another huge problem with
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.580]   cars today.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:05.820]   There's no app platform that runs across cars.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:11.300]   I remember in the days before Android, Larry Page complained, or like Google to do their
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:18.220]   mobile apps needed to have like drawers full of cell phones in order to maintain these.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.660]   And if you want the car version of that, Pandora has a page called Pandora in your car
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.420]   where they list 33 separate apps.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.420]   Oh, God.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:33.620]   And I assume to maintain that they have a garage full of cars that they can dig through.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:37.500]   And while a company like Pandora can do that, your standard like small time app developer
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:43.420]   cannot afford to buy 33 different vehicles because everybody runs their own software
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.620]   and it's just a huge mess.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.620]   Will this fix it?
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.500]   Will Android Automotive make this better?
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.500]   Yes.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.340]   It's the Android Auto app platform, which limits you to audio apps.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:58.580]   So like music and podcasts and stuff like that and messages.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:02.660]   And that's all you're allowed to do for safety reasons.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:07.300]   The Google makes the UI and app developers just plug into the UI.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:10.860]   So like every single audio app looks exactly the same.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.540]   Well, that's what Pandora wants.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.540]   That's what Spotify wants.
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.540]   I presume.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.900]   But what's really cool about Android Auto is that the car manufacturers skin Android,
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.100]   but they also skin the app templates.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:29.860]   So Spotify on the Volvo looks totally different than Spotify on the Audi and it's the exact
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:30.860]   same app.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:36.900]   The thing they plugged into was skinned so that it looks like a perfect part of the infotainment
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:37.900]   system.
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:38.900]   It looked great.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:41.100]   It was really cool looking.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:47.580]   So Jeff has resonates with him because you spent like two years looking for an Android
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:48.580]   Auto car.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.580]   I gave up.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.580]   I gave up.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.580]   I gave up.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:56.180]   And part of the problem was that when I played with Android Auto on the phone, it was so
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.180]   limiting.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.420]   It was so nannish that I was not crazy about it.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:05.420]   I never got the full experience and trying to find a car that had Android Auto and had
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.820]   one else I needed just didn't exist.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.380]   I also was being picking lots of ways.
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:12.380]   I needed four wheel drive for two days a year in New Jersey.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.140]   I did not want to pay for premium gas.
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:18.100]   So no car with a turbo, which took out a lot of them.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.060]   And I ended up with a Mazda CX5.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.100]   I like the car very much.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100]   The UI sucks.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.340]   It doesn't have Android Auto.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.700]   No, no, nothing like that.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:32.100]   So this is Ron's picture from, was this a show that you went to?
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.100]   This was IO.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.100]   They had.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:37.420]   Oh, so this is Spotify on Audi.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.860]   Yeah, that's the Audi.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.060]   And this is Spotify.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:42.060]   Volvo.
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.060]   Yep.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:46.140]   Exact same app, same code developer doesn't have to do anything.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.580]   This just happens automatically.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.580]   But this is Volvo.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:54.420]   You call it their accordion interface, which is kind of a weird funky interface.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:00.140]   The Volvo thing is very interesting because it looks exactly the way Volvo looks today.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:05.060]   They just ripped out the underlying operating system and used Android.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:11.780]   So from the consumer perspective, the difference is mostly going to be your software runs faster
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.540]   because it was made by a real software company.
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:17.980]   And you'll have a couple more apps, at least.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:25.380]   The big problem with Android Auto is there's still not a lot of stuff.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:29.820]   Not that many Android Auto apps, even like some really big media apps don't have Android
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:30.820]   Auto apps.
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:35.820]   And that makes it tough when you're stuck using Android Auto and it locks your phone
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.460]   out and everything else.
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:41.900]   But hopefully more developers will kind of get on board now.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:48.580]   So which do you think will be the best onboard entertainment system?
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:54.940]   Right now, everything based on Q and X was the nicest, which is like Audi and BMW and
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:17:00.940]   some other stuff, just because Q and X runs like a smartphone operating system in that
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:05.860]   it can do an animation and it will run at like a decent frame rate instead of the janky
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:11.500]   stuttery mess that Linux usually is and all the old, like the five year old Android that
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.500]   they had in these cars ran like a five year old Android device.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.500]   It was really bad.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.500]   Yeah, that's suppressing.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.140]   So yeah, anything Q and X ran really nice.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:25.180]   And my favorite thing was the Audi because they took the dashboard like they took the
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:28.140]   digital gauge cluster and stuck the map in it.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:32.780]   So you had the infotainment system directly in front of the driver rather than like off
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.140]   to the side in the center of the car.
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.900]   And that's something I hope more companies do.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.340]   Yeah, this is nice.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:42.420]   Actually, Tesla does that does a pretty nice job of it.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.420]   I think.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.420]   This is the Audi.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.500]   So you can see the dashboard.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.540]   So that does not run Android.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.700]   And that's a problem right now with the Android setup is that for safety reasons, those have
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.100]   to run a real time operating system like Q and X.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:04.460]   Like your speedometer is not allowed to lag because you're downloading a software.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:10.100]   So they were interested in ways they were investigating ways to kind of project a map
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.220]   or whatever else they needed into that, which is usually a separate computer.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.180]   So why is it Android automotive real time operating system?
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:20.580]   Because it's Linux and Android is not.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.220]   And that's a big mess.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.460]   It's just too slow.
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.140]   There is a way to converge those things.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:28.140]   If you want some.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:32.860]   So it's called, well, I think this would be a solution.
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:38.980]   It's happening because this is a big problem in the industrial IoT, but it's a TSN time
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.740]   sensitive networking.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:51.460]   So it's a protocol that is an attempt to bridge old proprietary messaging systems.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:57.340]   But you can also have an RTOS that's running on another computer somewhere and message using
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:01.020]   something that works with that over to ethernet.
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.500]   So in the automotive guys are actually really interested in this.
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.300]   So there you go.
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:10.220]   And Google does have a real time OS under development.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.220]   That's that's future.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.220]   But yeah, future.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.900]   We don't have to get into that.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.780]   Well, but that explains why they're doing future.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.220]   That explains why they're doing it.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.380]   Yeah, there's been a lot of questions.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:22.660]   What do you need with the third operational system that explains it?
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.260]   How far along is future?
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:28.060]   It's been in development for a year and a half.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:32.580]   So if you follow Android's development, that took about five years.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.180]   I still give them about three and a half years and we'll see.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.180]   Wow.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.260]   Fuchsia is based on a microkernel called Magenta.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.060]   This derived from little kernel.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.060]   It's all Google developed.
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:49.660]   Like I said, Google developed kernel with Google developed operating system running a
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.860]   Google developed programming language.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.180]   So they're just kicking everybody out the door and they're not going to deal with any
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.780]   upstream stuff.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:01.500]   And it's all Google Google Google and nobody really knows what they're going to do with
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.500]   it.
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:09.340]   And then you can do a smartphone like demo concept UI that you can download.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.420]   But other than that, who knows?
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:16.100]   We're talking to the guy who wrote the book on Fuchsia, by the way.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:20.020]   So we got the Fuchsia expert here.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:23.380]   I think it's really overhyped just because it's so not finished.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:28.340]   And like if you look at what Android looked at when they released their first emulator,
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.940]   that was back when it was a BlackBerry clone.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:37.540]   And like imagine if before the G1 came out, you spent all this time theorizing about the
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:42.860]   BlackBerry Android clone and what it did and how it worked and all that.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:48.140]   It's so early right now that I am not too worried about Fuchsia.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.700]   Like I'll peek at it once in a while.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:55.300]   But it does seem like a replacement for Android eventually one day.
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:57.580]   Like they straight up say it's going to run on smartphones.
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:03.860]   It's designed to run on a modern smartphone and on a modern desktop computer.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.820]   But like all projects inside of Google, they run multiple competing things at once.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.420]   It has nothing to do with the Android team.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.500]   I don't think it's going to merge with Android or anything.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.740]   They do these competing projects and some of them die.
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:19.980]   And Fuchsia could easily die and never see the light of day.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.020]   It's something that, like I said, it's like three years out.
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:28.020]   So just relax and don't get too hyped up about that.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.900]   It's still open source though, which is great.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.940]   BSD3, MIT, and Apache 2 licenses.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:34.940]   Not GPL.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.820]   But yeah, they get to get rid of the GPL.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.820]   That's interesting.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.740]   Although these other licenses are highly respected in the open source community.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:46.700]   So it's not that's, I mean, at least they're doing an open source operating system.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.100]   I think they understand how to do that.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:50.300]   But yeah, it takes a long time.
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:56.060]   I think if you want to read the tea leaves on Fuchsia, the thing to look out for is Flutter,
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:01.540]   which is Google's SDK for Fuchsia.
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:03.860]   Fuchsia should probably be called Flutter OS.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:10.420]   So Flutter is an SDK that you program in with the programming language Dart that Google
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:11.420]   invented.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.180]   There's so many code names for this stuff.
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.700]   It's ridiculous.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:20.580]   But Flutter apps run on Android iOS and Fuchsia.
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:28.820]   So if you see Google push developers to use Flutter, then that is the transition point
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:34.140]   to Fuchsia because they're telling people when you hear the word Flutter, that means
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.700]   write a Fuchsia app.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:40.220]   And you can do that today and it will run on Android and iOS.
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.660]   And in the future, if they ever release this operating system, it'll run on that too.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.100]   And Stacy will like this.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:49.300]   The system UI for Fuchsia is called Armadillo.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.300]   Ooh.
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:51.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:55.340]   They have a lovely little drawing there.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.900]   That guy is definitely on the art team.
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.180]   Spent some time doing that in a pick ballpoint pen.
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.180]   That's nice.
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:06.180]   But now Google draw can turn into a real Armadillo like that.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:10.180]   So because it runs on Android, you can download Armadillo and get it up and running on your
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:14.620]   phone, which is where I got the screenshots.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.620]   They bare bones.
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.100]   They get a long way to go, obviously.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.260]   It doesn't even work like nothing works at all.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.260]   None of the sliders work.
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.540]   The buttons don't really work.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.620]   The multi-window thing is crazy.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:28.300]   You can just drag apps on top of each other and it'll do a multi-window split.
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.500]   And then you can just keep going until it crashes and you have like eight multi-window
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:35.860]   splits where it's like, you know, horizontal and vertical lines and tiny little columns
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.420]   and everything's this big.
[01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:38.940]   So it seems powerful.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.940]   It's just nowhere near finished.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:44.500]   I mean, it takes a long time to do an OS.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.180]   These are not trivial things.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:51.340]   Do you know how many people are working on it?
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.220]   Not a bunch like double digit numbers.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.220]   Last I checked.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.220]   Okay.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.220]   That's a lot.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.220]   You can't get too big.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:03.300]   You can't, you know, as we know from the Mythical Man month, you can't just throw programmers
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300]   at it and solve it.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.700]   You can just taste that long.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:08.940]   Thank you for explaining that, Ron.
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:12.180]   I've been wondering what Fuchsia was all about for a long time.
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.180]   We didn't know.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:16.900]   I think we even referenced him when we talked about it last time.
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:17.900]   We did.
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:18.900]   We did.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:19.900]   Yes.
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:20.900]   We should ask Ron.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:21.900]   We should go Ron on.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.140]   That's probably why you're here.
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:34.460]   Why aren't, why is, how come Android is still taking so long to get on Chromebooks and not?
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.100]   I think Ron can explain that too.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:38.900]   Can you explain that Ron?
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:44.860]   Well, on the Pro, on the Chromebook Pro, that's Intel based and that's a little harder than
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.260]   the ARM based plus Samsung Chromebook plus.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.860]   So still in beta on the Pro?
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:57.100]   Well, like I was saying, it's still not done.
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:04.100]   I think they just got it up and running on Android 7.0 NuGet, but it still doesn't do
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:10.380]   things like take advantage of the multi-window API so apps aren't resizable.
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:12.740]   Yeah, and that's really ugly.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.700]   I've played with that on my Chromebook.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:19.900]   It just looks like you've got a phone app in portrait mode on your screen.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:24.900]   It's as bad as the Android tablet experience was.
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.740]   Yeah, there's a ton of bugs right now.
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:32.980]   It seems to be a lot better now than it was when Chromebook Pro review units went out in
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.300]   February.
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:43.280]   But they're trying to make Android run on top of Chrome OS in a container thing and it's
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:49.460]   just really complicated and it was never supposed to be easy and it's just taking way longer
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:51.940]   than they expect really.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:55.980]   And that's why you see, I think, why you see the Chromebook Pro get delayed.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.860]   They're all just waiting for the software to be finished.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:04.940]   Paul Therat had a good article about all of this and why it's taken so long.
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.980]   Do we know why?
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:11.740]   So apparently all Chromebooks that are sold this year will have eventually have access
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.540]   to the Play Store.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.180]   But it seems to kind of mystery which ones don't.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:21.340]   For instance, why the Pixel 1 will not and the Pixel 2 will.
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:22.340]   Both have touch.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:25.980]   Both are very powerful machines with lots of RAM.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.580]   Isn't it that the Pixel is end of life?
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:29.580]   Is that it?
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.740]   It's just not going to spend any energy on it.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.500]   Yeah, it's just not supported.
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:42.500]   It probably matters what version of Linux you use and what underlying software is there.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.940]   And they probably just want to kill the old Pixel because probably no one uses it.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.700]   I imagine they sold a very small amount.
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:48.700]   You know who uses it?
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.500]   Jason Howell uses it.
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.140]   Yeah, yeah, I saw him with that.
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.340]   It's the last man standing.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.140]   So what should Jeff do?
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.540]   Because he wants a Chromebook.
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:05.340]   But I was saying wait for the Asus C302A that has the--
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:06.620]   I think that's probably the one.
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.980]   The i7 and the 16 gigs of RAM.
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:10.980]   But that's the little town.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:11.980]   That would be good.
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.220]   Yeah, I don't know the specs.
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:17.500]   I don't know the specs for the Chromebook Pro.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.340]   Didn't you look-- you talked about it on ours, I thought.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:21.340]   You didn't look at it.
[01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:22.340]   You didn't kill it.
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.340]   Oh, I just don't.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.340]   Comes out in three days.
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.340]   Three or four days.
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.340]   Yeah, that would be cool to play with.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.340]   I'm not the Chromebook Plus.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:35.340]   Jeff got it on my recommendation, I'm sorry, and didn't like it.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:40.340]   Oh, so the-- OK, the Pro was a core M3.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.340]   Right.
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.340]   What was the Asus one?
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:46.340]   They said that we're going to have, I think, a--
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:50.340]   I don't know if it'd be a mobile part, probably would be an i5 or an i7.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:51.340]   Geez.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:53.340]   But nobody's seen a higher hair of it.
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:56.340]   I mean, they now so long ago.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.340]   Yeah, all of the--
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:58.340]   C320, 302.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.340]   Because the software is not done.
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.340]   It's a flip.
[01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:06.340]   It's two and one, very similar to the Samsung.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:07.340]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:12.340]   I can't do Chromebooks because I don't do Photoshop, so I'm just out of luck there.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.340]   You can't do Chromebooks because you do Photoshop?
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:16.340]   Yeah, they don't have Photoshop.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.340]   Oh, you need Photoshop.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:19.340]   So, work, yeah.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.340]   It says it's a core M3.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.340]   Does that tell you enough?
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.340]   No, that's the current one.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:29.340]   So the current one is an Asus C302CA.
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:32.340]   Yes, the current one is an M3.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:35.340]   But they have teased that they're going to do a faster one.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.340]   Oh, I see.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:40.340]   I thought it was an i7, but I may be wrong on that.
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.340]   And it's probably still a mobile, but still.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:46.340]   And 16 gigs of RAM, which is even more important.
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.340]   That's the key.
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.340]   And I wish it would do LTE.
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.340]   You know, so the new...
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:55.340]   So I don't know how miserable would I be with a Microsoft service?
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:58.340]   I don't think you'd be all that miserable, to be honest with you.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:28:59.340]   Well, I'm always miserable.
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:03.340]   What's changed is that we don't really use the operating system anymore.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:08.340]   You could use a Microsoft Windows tablet like you use a Chromebook.
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:13.340]   Just keep Chrome full-screen running and you would never see Windows.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:14.340]   Yeah, I'm the same way.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:17.340]   I have a Windows computer and a Mac laptop added.
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:22.340]   And switching doesn't bother me because I use Chrome and Dropbox and Photoshop.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.340]   I think that's increasingly the case.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:26.340]   Yeah, and if you use Adobe applications, it doesn't matter.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   I'm actually bringing a Windows laptop on my trip because I'll just be using Light, Roman Chrome.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:34.340]   And I wanted something powerful and light.
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:35.340]   And I like to...
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.340]   I do...
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:39.340]   I don't know why, but I like that two-in-one fold-over thing.
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:42.340]   Because you can tent it and watch a movie on the plane.
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:44.340]   And you could use it as a tablet.
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.340]   And you could also use it as a laptop.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.340]   I just like that.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.340]   I don't like detachable screens.
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.340]   That's why I don't like the...
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:50.340]   No, that's the problem I'll have.
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:53.340]   I don't like the Pro because the surface is detachable.
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:59.340]   It's just really a tablet with a flimsy little keyboard that sticks on it.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:03.340]   Yeah, laptops are tough right now since Apple did the whole MacBook thing.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:07.340]   The next one is supposed to have a better battery, which would be super great.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.340]   Yep.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.340]   But right now it's tough.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:13.340]   Hmm...
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:16.340]   Jeff, we don't know what to do for you.
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:18.340]   You know what you might...
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.340]   Yeah, look at the Surface Laptop.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:21.340]   You know what?
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:23.340]   Here's a wild one.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:30.340]   Use the Surface Laptop, which comes with Windows 10S, which is kind of like...
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.340]   It's like the Chromebook of Windows.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.340]   You can only use apps that are in the store.
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:38.340]   It's very light.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:40.340]   It's very portable.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.340]   You can get it.
[01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:43.340]   Yeah, the Windows store has such a great browser selection.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.340]   Well, no, you have to use Edge.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.340]   You can't use Chrome, and that's kind of a...
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:49.340]   Oh, well, that defeats it.
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:50.340]   That's it.
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:51.340]   You have to have Chrome, huh?
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:53.340]   I mean, you can plus...
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.340]   I have my Google Play and I have my Netflix and my HBO Go.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.340]   Well, yeah, it was hard.
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:30:59.340]   Showtime going.
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.340]   Showtime beats the heck out of HBO because I can download.
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:04.340]   Both of those, I think, are available in the Windows Store.
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:11.340]   If you buy the Surface Laptop now, you can upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro for free.
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:12.340]   B!
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.340]   I don't know.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:19.340]   I just think I'd probably bombard the show with complaints and whining.
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.340]   I know you.
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:21.340]   But you'll love the luxurious...
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:22.340]   I'll blame you for it.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.340]   Rich Alcantara material covered keyboard.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.340]   You'll love that.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:28.340]   It's got a fabric keyboard.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.340]   Ew!
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.340]   No.
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:31.340]   Yes!
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:33.340]   No, how do you clean up?
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:35.340]   No, how do you clean up with alcohol then?
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.340]   You don't.
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.340]   Oh, no.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:39.340]   Yeah, I really wonder how that will age.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:41.340]   Space age materials.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.340]   No.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:43.340]   No, no, no.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:44.340]   Stasis.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:45.340]   Stasis.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:46.340]   Ew!
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.340]   Are you a germaphobe?
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.340]   Stasis, is this something we didn't know?
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.340]   I'm not a germaphobe, but dear God, keyboards are...
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.340]   They're filthy.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:58.340]   Clearly, looking at her office, she's a messaphobe.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:01.340]   I think you could use a Clorox wipe on it.
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:03.340]   I don't think that would hurt it.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:04.340]   It's plastic, basically.
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:08.340]   Alcantara is polyurethane and polyester.
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.340]   Isn't that what Tesla has?
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:12.340]   Is there a header inside the car?
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.340]   Yes, a headliner.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.340]   Okay.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:15.340]   A headliner, that's it.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:20.340]   No, only if you upgrade to the finest things in life.
[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:22.340]   Why does Corinthian headliner?
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:27.340]   It's Corinthian Alcantara.
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:29.340]   Yes!
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:38.340]   So, Mark Zuckerberg says, "I am not using this trip to run for office."
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:46.060]   Some of you have asked, he writes on Facebook on Sunday, "If this 50 states in a year challenge
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:50.340]   means I'm running for public office, I am not."
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:54.260]   I'm doing it to get a broader perspective, to make sure we're best serving our community
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:58.540]   of almost 2 billion people at Facebook, and doing the best work to promote equal opportunity
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:01.340]   at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.340]   So there.
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.540]   That's what everybody says.
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.540]   Everybody's not running for president.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:07.980]   I don't think he's running for office.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:10.940]   I just don't think, I think he couldn't bear politics.
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:14.940]   Yeah, I can't see Mark Zuckerberg really enjoying politics.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:15.940]   God.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.140]   Did you see him live streaming his visit to his Harvard?
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.740]   No, I missed it.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:22.740]   I saw it was up there.
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.740]   Was it funny?
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.740]   He and his wife Priscilla.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:30.540]   His Priscilla was his girlfriend despite the movie.
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.940]   Priscilla was his girlfriend in college.
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.140]   Why am I not getting audio?
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:35.140]   Is that me?
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:38.540]   Oh, it's your fault?
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:39.540]   Okay.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.340]   It's not your fault.
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.140]   6.5 million views of Mark.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.460]   It is old.
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:50.700]   First time he visited his Harvard dorm room since he invented Facebook.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:57.140]   And by the way, yes, there was an old beer that he'd left there some years ago.
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.140]   Here it is.
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.140]   H33.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.540]   Do you know where this is?
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.540]   Carsten?
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:05.340]   It's the jock dorm really.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.260]   Ha ha.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:09.540]   Was Mark a jock?
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.860]   Huh.
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.940]   It explains his love of the Adidas flip flops.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:21.420]   He went to visit his high school and then he went to visit his old dorm room.
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:22.420]   I've done that.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.420]   Have you done that?
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.420]   Carsten is kind of fun.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.140]   Go see your old dorm room.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.060]   No, too many bad memories.
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.980]   What house were you in?
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.980]   He was in Adams.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:34.900]   Which house is this?
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.860]   You were in the artsy house?
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:45.260]   By the way, H33 is now considered the most coveted dorm room in America.
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:48.780]   Ha ha ha ha.
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:51.660]   Because Mark Zuckerberg was there.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:55.140]   They didn't entry in his dorm room and dorm room and like preserve it.
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:56.900]   It's unchanged since Mark was here.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.060]   He gives a billion dollars.
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.060]   They'll do that.
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:02.940]   His math formulas are still on the window where he wrote them.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:04.300]   Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:07.140]   Well, that's a good use of Facebook.
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.820]   That's a good use of Facebook live.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:12.220]   I think that's kind of cool.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:15.060]   So when is his address?
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.060]   H33.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:19.060]   The when when is his commencement address?
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.580]   Oh, is he speaking?
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:22.300]   Oh, that's why he's there.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:23.300]   That's why he's there.
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.300]   Yes.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:25.300]   He's a starboard.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.100]   Remember we showed the Bill Gates?
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.100]   Zuckerberg.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.980]   I have some audio now.
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.500]   Can you hear it now?
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:39.620]   What is wrong with me?
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:42.140]   How have I failed you?
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:44.940]   I failed you in so many ways.
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.940]   It's probably me.
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.580]   It's just me.
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:51.380]   It's just windows.
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:55.900]   My sound is on sending it out the HDMI port.
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:57.700]   All right.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:02.100]   We don't have to share our private family troubles with the rest of the world.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:06.940]   The students who lived here during the year have moved out by now.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:13.380]   So the folks who are here now are basically, yeah, they're Harvard is this program they
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:17.540]   allow students who haven't graduated yet.
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:23.580]   So these guys are rising juniors to come live in the dorms and help out crew with this
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:24.580]   is strong.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:25.580]   This is the activities.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.580]   I don't care.
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.580]   All right.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.580]   That's what Harvard does.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.940]   It's like you get the Harvard cards.
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:33.500]   So you guys are what?
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:36.380]   You're rising juniors and seniors.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:37.860]   We just met right before this.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:40.420]   You want to introduce yourself and tell them what you know.
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:41.420]   Congratulations.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:42.420]   Thank you.
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:43.420]   All right.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:48.700]   So many stories from this this week from 13 years ago, they got pretty good at this.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.700]   This is pretty good.
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.620]   None that I should tell.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:57.260]   The overlap between the overlap that we have between stories that are good.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:01.420]   Stories that I'm not already going to share a commencement on in two days and stories
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:05.380]   that are reasonable to tell on a live stream with a hundred thousand people watching is
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.380]   very small.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:12.100]   Let's just say I was 18 when you were in this room and people should be allowed to move
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:15.060]   on from things that happen when they were 18 years old.
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:19.620]   That's ironic considering Facebook's business.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.620]   We'll never let you move on.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:29.660]   Everything you do is now memorialized for future.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:33.340]   Private chat rooms have been added to Facebook Live, so that'll help people do the right
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:37.140]   thing.
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:38.700]   Amazon is hired.
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:39.700]   James Gosling.
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:40.940]   We had a great interview with James.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:45.460]   He's the inventor of Java when he was at Sun Microsystems.
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:50.860]   Told some good stories about that on triangulation some months ago.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:38:01.020]   He is now going to work as he's got a good title like senior special heavyweight person.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.820]   What is his title?
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.540]   I can't find it.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:08.740]   He was when we talked to him, he was working distinguished engineer.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:14.140]   He was working designing underwater robots when we talked to him.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:15.540]   Remember that?
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.380]   That was cool.
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:19.380]   Distinguished engineer.
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.340]   I don't know what I should have said this title.
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:24.700]   I think it is though, something like that.
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.980]   Sorry about other hiring older people.
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:27.980]   That's a good thing.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:31.820]   Oh, that's my friend James Governor from Redpunk.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.620]   That's who it was.
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.340]   He's a smart dude.
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.580]   And yes, I was pulling up his thing so I could see.
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:46.460]   Yeah, his blog post was on AWS demolishing the cult of youth over at Redpunk.
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:47.460]   Good.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:54.620]   And it talked about them hiring Adrian, Cockroft, and how James Hamilton, who if you've never
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:57.460]   seen a present, he's hilarious and he's like 51.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:58.900]   And he's still sporting his mullet.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:38:59.900]   So.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.900]   51 is not that old.
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:01.900]   Not that old.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:02.900]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:03.900]   He's in his 50s.
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:05.700]   Oh, and they talked about Tim Bray being hired there.
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.300]   Oh, I love Tim Bray.
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.300]   There you go.
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.300]   He's 61 now.
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:10.300]   Tim's 61.
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:11.300]   Wow.
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.340]   I always think of him as a youngster.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:19.660]   Hackers have defeated the Iris scanner in your Galaxy S8, the Chaos Computer Club in
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:26.380]   Germany has figured out how to simulate your Iris.
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:32.100]   This is the same group that bypassed Apple's Touch ID system in 2013.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:38.700]   A camera with a 200 millimeter lens, a long telephoto lens can capture a usable picture
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:44.060]   of your Iris from up to 16 feet away.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:49.940]   And at that point, you can print it out with a laser printer.
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:55.140]   Ironically, the best results on a Samsung laser printer.
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:03.260]   Then you place a contact lens on top of the print to mimic the curvature of a real eye.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:04.260]   That's awesome.
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:06.580]   That is great thinking.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:11.660]   Once all of this space based security, you know, the face unlock thing that Samsung
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:15.660]   did and was also broken and the eyeball thing, it's like, it's really weird because there's
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.340]   a lot of pictures of people's faces on the internet.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.940]   Like that's the number one thing that's got to be out there.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:25.620]   It seems like a really weird thing to base your security around.
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:29.020]   Whereas like a fingerprint, there's way less fingerprint pictures out there.
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:30.740]   Yeah, although.
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:35.780]   So they're taking with just a point and shoot from just a kind of medium distance.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:37.180]   They don't really need to get in close.
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:38.700]   See, that's good enough.
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.860]   They're taking his picture.
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:46.420]   Then they're printing it out.
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:50.020]   And then I guess they're going to put a contact lens on it.
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:51.020]   That's kind of...
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:55.580]   What you're saying is that is it any photo of somebody that already exists, this could
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:56.580]   be done with?
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.580]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:58.580]   Look, see, they got a contact lens.
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.140]   You got to get the eye the same size.
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:02.060]   That's a pretty high-rise picture.
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:04.180]   Well, does it?
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:05.180]   Whoa.
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:06.780]   Now fast, that unlocked it.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.780]   Wow.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:11.460]   That's the beauty of that, by the way, that iris recognition is really fast.
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:14.900]   Even if it's not very safe.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:15.900]   The folks...
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:16.900]   No, that's...
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:17.900]   Yes.
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:18.900]   That's a lot of work.
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:20.900]   Right.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:21.900]   I would use...
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:23.260]   I would back up your...
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.300]   I would use a long password would be the best thing.
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:31.420]   It's the kind of thing that like a targeted VIP would fall victim to, but not necessarily
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:32.820]   like your average phone thief.
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:35.060]   No, no, no, no, no, but yeah.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.900]   I mean, if you're a public figure or whatever.
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:38.900]   Leo's concerned.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:39.900]   I'm always concerned.
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:40.900]   However...
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.860]   I bet I could get Trump's iris pretty easily.
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:43.860]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:44.940]   You know, like somebody like that.
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.380]   Like a Post-it note, you know?
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.380]   It's easy.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:48.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:51.980]   I am interested in what one password is doing.
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:55.620]   They're one of the most popular password vaults out there.
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:58.500]   And they've created a new travel mode.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.420]   This is what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:03.140]   Designed for travelers.
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:09.180]   So the idea is you will designate the passwords that are okay to reveal.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:11.620]   It's marked safe for travel.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:15.940]   And then everything else will get deleted before you get off the plane.
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:19.900]   It'll be removed from your device in every respect possible.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:24.180]   But don't worry because one password still has your password fall and they'll restore
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.260]   it when you get home.
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:29.380]   So can the authorities force you to restore it?
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:33.020]   No, because they say there's no way of knowing travel mode is there.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.420]   It's up now.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:41.900]   So wait, so is the implementation like they won't see my Facebook app that's on my phone
[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:42.900]   when they ask me?
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:43.900]   No, the apps are still there.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:48.340]   Yeah, they're going to ask me to open it and then I'll just be like, I can't because I
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:49.700]   don't have access to my passwords.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:51.140]   Say my passwords on.
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:54.500]   Yeah, I don't have my passwords.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:57.260]   Could they hold me in contempt of court?
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:01.900]   You know, I'm going to test this in a couple of weeks and I'll let you know.
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.940]   I'm a little nervous.
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:07.220]   I think what you say is I forget.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.220]   I forget.
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.220]   And they're good.
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.860]   Rather than do I not going to unlock it?
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:11.860]   Just I forget.
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:12.860]   Don't say no.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:15.220]   Just say, I don't know it.
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.220]   I don't.
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:17.220]   It's at home.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.060]   It's at my password, Voll at home.
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:24.580]   Didn't we discuss a legal case that had a guy who declined to give who he declined to
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:30.300]   give his password because he had child pornography on his computer.
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:33.740]   The judge said you have.
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:39.140]   So is that a worrying precedent we should look to when we look at this?
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:42.100]   That's the problem is the courts are not in agreement on this.
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.340]   Well, one password pay your legal fees.
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:47.540]   If you want to be the test case, I don't think so.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:52.020]   FCC, let's talk about net neutrality.
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.620]   You've got eight minutes.
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:54.620]   I got eight minutes.
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:55.620]   All right.
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:56.780]   Let's not my time.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.500]   I'll just tell you a couple of things that make me mad.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:06.660]   One, if you went to go FCC yourself, John Oliver's site because you wanted to comment
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.660]   on this.
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:09.140]   Let's see if it's working now.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:15.860]   The FCC pulled down the public comments because they say they were de-dossed, but then they
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.060]   would give no evidence that they were de-dossed.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:19.260]   Nope, it's back up.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:20.260]   Good.
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.300]   So they've put those comments back on.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.300]   So if you go FCC yourself, please do it while you can.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:30.580]   There's also some evidence of astroturfing going on.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:37.220]   People, internet service providers using your name to pretend that you're against net neutrality.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.940]   I hate net neutrality.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:44.940]   And then Jeff, I imagine you're a little miffed by the story of John M. Donnelly who's with
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:50.500]   the CQ Roll Call and is also chairman, ironically, of the National Press Club's Press Freedom
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:51.580]   Team.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:59.100]   He was booted out of FCC headquarters because he had the temerity to ask questions of the
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:00.100]   FCC Commission.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:07.380]   In a government-owned building that was accused of violating the privacy of the FCC
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.620]   head, it's just ridiculous.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:11.700]   These people work for us, but they don't realize it.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.900]   I'm not getting in trouble from somebody in Twitter.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.700]   Oh, yeah, we're up politics into the show.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.700]   See why I brought it into the show.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:23.180]   No, he was walking up after a commission meeting and just was trying to talk to him.
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:24.180]   Like he was-
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:34.740]   I mean, having been to the FCC and done similar things, this is not terrible behavior.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:41.660]   The good news is Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico and Maggie Hasen of New Hampshire set
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:50.100]   a letter to Adjut Pai one day later questioning this behavior.
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:53.940]   They said in their letter, the FCC should set a sterling example in what comes to supporting
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:57.540]   the First Amendment and freedom of the press.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:59.900]   Yesterday's incident is not an isolated one.
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:05.780]   This seems to be a part of a larger pattern of hostility toward the press, which underscores
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:08.420]   our serious concern.
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:12.740]   It doesn't- it's just a letter.
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:18.340]   No investigation, no committee has been formed, but nevertheless.
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:23.580]   And then in England, the Tory's platform, they call it their manifesto.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:28.940]   You know that Theresa May and the Tories are- she called an election there up for election.
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:36.620]   And the Tory platform is- well, here's a line towards the end of the platform.
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:41.780]   Some people say it is not for the government to regulate when it comes to technology and
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.060]   the internet.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:44.380]   We disagree.
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:46.940]   But it's not just the Tories.
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:51.420]   Apparently the liberals are also kind of pro.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:56.460]   You know, let's shut the internet down because it's full of bad stuff.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:58.340]   And legislation- Yes, it's going all wrong.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:02.100]   If they win their seats, legislation may be introduced to protect the public from abuse
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.660]   and offensive material online.
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:06.180]   And everyone would have the right to wipe material.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.020]   They'll protect the public from the public.
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:09.020]   Yes.
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:10.020]   And the right to forget?
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:15.220]   Yes, you'll have the right to wipe material that was posted when you were under 18.
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:18.020]   Mark Zuckerberg would like that, Priscilla Chan would like that.
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:22.140]   Internet companies would also be asked to help promote counter-extremism narratives, new
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:26.820]   rules requiring companies to make it harder for people to access pornography and violent
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:27.980]   images.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:32.860]   All content creators are forced to justify their policies to the government.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:34.380]   Labor's doing the same thing.
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:39.220]   You know, so if you live in the UK, well, brace yourself.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:41.700]   No Europe, no internet.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:49.740]   Australia is talking about a Google tax.
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:53.300]   Let's do a quick ad because I want Stacy to give us her pick of the week.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:57.020]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:02.180]   The best mortgage lender in the country has made that even better because now you can
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:05.380]   do the mortgage approval process completely online.
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:09.180]   If you're going to buy a new home and you've got to get a mortgage or if you're going to
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:13.260]   refire your existing home, you want to go to a lender not only that you can trust, and
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:17.060]   of course, Quick and Loans is the best, but also one that's transparent that helps you
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:22.060]   make the right decisions and makes it easy.
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:24.860]   Don't waste time searching through stacks of paperwork with Rocket Mortgage.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:28.340]   You can share the financial info you need to get approval.
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:31.500]   And by the way, because it's all on computers, you can do it on your phone, on your tablet,
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.000]   on your computer.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.900]   It's turned it around in minutes.
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:39.180]   Last time we bought a house, it took a month to get the loan from that big bank.
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.700]   Next time, believe me, Rocket Mortgage.
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:43.380]   You can even adjust the rate and length of your loan in real time and make sure you get
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:45.660]   the solution that's right for you.
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:53.300]   Click the bank, skip the waiting, go completely online, quickandlones.com/twig for Rocket Mortgage
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:59.940]   Equal Housing Lender License to all 50 states and MLSconsumeraccess.org 3030, we thank.
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:03.540]   Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans for their support for this week in Google.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:07.060]   Go to Quick and Loans and maybe you're not buying right now, but make a note of this,
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:08.860]   quickandlones.com/twig.
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:14.060]   Stacey, you've got two minutes to give us your thing.
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:15.060]   Awesome.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:16.060]   Ta-da!
[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:17.060]   What is that?
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:18.860]   He's ready for us.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:21.580]   I was like, I keep him right here.
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:24.460]   This is the WeMo dimmer switch.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:26.100]   This just came out.
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:30.220]   Okay, so the good thing is WeMo has had a light switch for a long time.
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:33.740]   So you show us the loot run before I recommended that, right?
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.740]   Yes.
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:37.620]   Oh, it's just doing the same thing.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:41.420]   Yes, this is a dimmer, except it doesn't require a hub.
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:42.420]   Oh.
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:47.780]   $50, which is kind of expensive for a Wi-Fi dimmer switch because I have the box for it.
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:49.340]   I don't have the light switch.
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:55.540]   I also have the Leviton Wi-Fi dimmer switch that's only about 45 or 50.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:59.060]   So but if you're already in the WeMo world, this is nice.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:00.060]   It's pretty.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.420]   I haven't installed it yet.
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:03.380]   That's happening this weekend, but I will show you.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:04.380]   It is pretty.
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:06.100]   I like the night mode at close.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.100]   It does.
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:08.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:11.460]   So here's here we are back in the light switch.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.060]   We need a neutral wire for this.
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:14.060]   So keep that in mind.
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:16.580]   And here's the front.
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:19.180]   It's not a what sort I want here.
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:21.780]   You don't it doesn't click like a normal toggle switch.
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:25.340]   There's a little bit of give here, but it's not like on off kind of clicky.
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.860]   It's more like you run your finger along it.
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:28.860]   Uh huh.
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:29.860]   And this is a touch thing.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:32.820]   I wike the tear from a baby's eye.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:34.260]   Just like that.
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:35.580]   So Stacy, this is your living.
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:39.740]   I also want to hear your thoughts on the IKEA stuff.
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:41.740]   And about the IKEA stuff that it's.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:46.180]   The fact that they're going to have a whole line that's compatible with both home and
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:47.180]   Amazon.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:49.180]   IoT home lighting.
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:50.180]   Yes.
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:52.180]   It's going to be called.
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:54.260]   Pride free.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.260]   So we've talked about this.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:57.940]   I have like a couple.
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:58.940]   No.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.940]   Okay.
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.900]   A cut like a month ago, I had IKEA on my show.
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:04.180]   So the guy who's in charge of all of this.
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.180]   So if you want details.
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:09.100]   Is this support like Zigbee or is it its own standard or?
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:13.900]   Broad fee is the current product or Zigbee with the hub that'll convert it.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:18.940]   It's like $80 for the hub and I think two light bulbs.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:21.340]   You can buy them at your local IKEA now.
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:23.820]   You can't buy them online.
[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:26.540]   And they're all right.
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:27.540]   They're not.
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.540]   They're not.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:35.460]   Of the Lutron Levitton and wemo.
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.980]   Which do you like the best?
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:41.780]   Or do you not have enough information?
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.620]   I haven't installed this wemo switch.
[01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:48.260]   I hated the original wemo switch, but we most done a lot of work on their software.
[01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:52.860]   I also hated it because it was a smart switch with no dimmer, which was just stupid.
[01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:53.860]   Okay.
[01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:55.100]   Go get your daughter.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.540]   She's waiting on the curb wondering where mommy is.
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:51:59.540]   Yeah, they start charging me if I'm late.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.540]   What?
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:01.540]   Oh, man.
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:04.100]   They got to keep someone there for.
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:05.100]   All right.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.100]   Bye.
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:07.100]   Thank you.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:08.100]   See podcast.com.
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:09.100]   Stay safe.
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.100]   Stay safe.
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:11.100]   Bye.
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:12.100]   Stay safe.
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:18.100]   And now it's time for Jeff's number.
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:19.340]   No, I lost mine.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:20.340]   I'm okay.
[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:22.540]   Now it's time for Ron.
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:24.380]   Ron's runs thing.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:25.380]   Hi, Ron.
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.380]   Okay.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:31.300]   This just arrived like two hours ago and I'm super excited about it.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:33.380]   But I don't know that much about it right now.
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:36.980]   Do you remember the old optimist keyboards?
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:38.980]   Art.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:39.980]   Levadev.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:40.980]   Are Levadev.
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:45.380]   They were these really cool keyboards that had like LCDs and OLEDs on the keys.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:53.540]   The keys and somebody actually made a real life one that you can actually buy that works.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:55.100]   Let me get a little more.
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:56.660]   Oh, this is from El Gato.
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.500]   They used to make Mac stuff.
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:52:59.500]   Yes.
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:02.260]   This is the El Gato stream deck.
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:06.180]   And the name stream deck is because it's for like Twitch streamers.
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:07.180]   But screw that.
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.500]   I'm going to turn it into a productivity device.
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:13.460]   So like all these, these are all keys here and you can you can press buttons and the
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:14.460]   whole thing will change.
[01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.460]   150 bucks.
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:18.860]   Yeah, it's 150 bucks.
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:24.100]   And the optimist version of this was like a thousand dollars and you could never ever
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.100]   buy one.
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:28.620]   And I always, I always like lost it after the pictures on the internet.
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:31.740]   But like this, this thing came out in March.
[01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:33.100]   The little keys are great.
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.020]   Like it seems to be working awesome.
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:42.340]   The only problem I have with it is that the look, the software is for like Twitch streamers.
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:44.260]   So it doesn't do a lot of things.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:48.180]   It's designed for OBS studio or tippy stream and stuff like that.
[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:50.940]   But what you can do is run exe.
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:56.300]   So I'm just making auto hotkey scripts and binding them to all the buttons.
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:00.100]   So I can do things like paste, text.
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:03.940]   Like one of the things I do all the time when I'm writing is link to past articles.
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:08.860]   And a lot of stuff is very like foundational, like the major Android OS reviews.
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:13.380]   And I can just have that on a button that says link this text as the Android review or
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:16.580]   link this text as the last phone review or whatever.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:20.220]   So like with auto hotkey, which is a bunch of programming, I can have it.
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.220]   I love auto hotkey.
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:27.940]   This is interesting because really what it is is to kind of give a big time TV switcher
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:31.140]   capabilities to online streamers.
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:32.140]   It's kind of nice.
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:34.140]   Yeah.
[01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:35.780]   And if you're willing to do the programming work, I think it's going to be an awesome
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:36.780]   little productivity device.
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:43.060]   And the best thing is this little stand that can hop out and it can kind of sit up like
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.260]   this on your desk.
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:47.300]   You got to come back and give us a review after you vote.
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:48.820]   Yeah, I showed this.
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:52.500]   I showed this to the guys in Slack and they're like, so when is your review?
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.620]   And I'm like, I guess I'm right about it.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:57.260]   Now more work.
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:03.300]   You'll find Ron's great work at R is technical.com and he's on Twitter, Ronamadio.
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:05.180]   And it's always great to see you.
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:06.980]   Thanks so much for spending some time with us today, Ron.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:07.980]   I appreciate it.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:08.980]   Sure.
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:11.580]   And finally, Jeff Jarvis, did you find your number?
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:12.580]   No, I had a link.
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:13.580]   No, I've lost it.
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:14.580]   I had a link.
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:19.740]   Was fascinating, but I can't find it again about how Street View was 10 years old.
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:22.380]   And there were some great links in there about how artists are using it.
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:23.380]   And I can't find it.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:24.380]   Oh, you pasted it.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:25.620]   You pasted it a different link in.
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:26.620]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:30.060]   I did something into the, yeah, I did with two links.
[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:32.420]   I don't know how I did that, but I did it.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.420]   So I messed up.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:34.420]   It's a style of time.
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:35.420]   10 years old.
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:37.940]   Is it really 10 years old?
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:40.700]   That's what the story said if I can find it.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.700]   Yeah, sure.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:43.500]   It seems like it.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:47.500]   That was the conversation US.
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:48.620]   Here it is from the Guardian.
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:49.620]   How about this?
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.620]   That's Google Maps.
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:51.620]   That's an old story.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:54.620]   How Google Street View became fertile ground for artists?
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:55.620]   Yes.
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:56.620]   Fertile.
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:57.620]   Fertile.
[01:55:57.620 --> 01:55:58.620]   That's the key.
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:00.620]   Where did you find it?
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.620]   New Atlas?
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:02.620]   Google.
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:05.620]   It's the conversation.com.
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:07.620]   Get the conversation.
[01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:09.620]   Oh, it's the conversation.
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:11.620]   10th anniversary.
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:12.620]   There we go.
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:13.620]   Yes, that's it.
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:14.620]   Thank you.
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:15.620]   Wow.
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:18.820]   So there's various artists things up there where they found all this amazing thing.
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:19.820]   Click anywhere.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:22.620]   The nine eyes of Google Street View.
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:23.620]   Wow.
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:24.620]   Wow.
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:25.620]   Wow.
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:28.380]   Oh my God.
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.940]   So those cars drive around.
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:33.500]   You could see, oh, there's twins.
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:39.340]   You could see why the Germans are nervous about all this.
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:40.340]   Interesting.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:41.620]   Is that fun or what?
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:42.620]   What?
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:44.940]   The snapshots of life.
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:54.580]   So this is one of many, many art pieces linked to from this, the conversation.com.
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:57.500]   A series of unfortunate events.
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:00.260]   Look, a van fire.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:01.660]   Michael Wolf did this.
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:04.580]   That's cool.
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:05.580]   He's a compute.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:09.620]   He got an honorable mention in the world press photo competition for photographs he took from
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:10.620]   Street View.
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:13.540]   That's funny.
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:14.620]   That's funny.
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:15.620]   This is cool.
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:16.620]   Yeah, it is cool.
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:17.620]   So I'll be speaking.
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:18.820]   Ron, how would you search for to find it?
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:21.020]   I was searching for the last five minutes.
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:26.180]   I searched for whatever words you said onto it.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:28.660]   It was Street View 10 artist.
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:29.660]   Thank you.
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:36.420]   By the way, and from this, I have learned that Street View blurs not only human faces,
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:37.420]   but bunny faces.
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:42.460]   Well, when that is the press secretary of the president of the United States, Sean Spicer
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:43.980]   in that bunny outfit.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:51.460]   Who's apparently ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this week in Google.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:52.460]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:59.180]   He's a CUNY where he's a distinguished professor of journalism at the town.
[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:00.180]   Is the townite center?
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:01.180]   Did I get to?
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:02.180]   That's a nice.
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.180]   No, town.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:04.180]   Just night.
[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:05.180]   And he is.
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:06.180]   So townite center.
[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:07.180]   How?
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:08.180]   That's a townite.
[01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:11.940]   How is it going with that Facebook initiative that Craig's Craig list Facebook and Craigslist
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:16.980]   having Craig Newmark and philanthropies and Ford and six other supporters.
[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:19.780]   Well, we're going to announce our managing director tomorrow.
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:20.780]   Somebody who's just great.
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:21.780]   Okay.
[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.780]   And then we get rolling.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:23.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:26.620]   So we're also, I think it's already been out publicly.
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:31.220]   We gave a grant, a matching grant to Jimmy Wales, Biki Tribune.
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:36.460]   And just while we were on the show practically, they met their crowdfunding goal.
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:37.460]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:40.020]   I gave him a little bit of money with eight hours left.
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:42.620]   10 out of 10 journalists funded.
[01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:45.020]   So they funded 10 journals, which is a big deal.
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:48.220]   So we gave to that and we're going to announce a couple of the grants.
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:49.380]   That's a good grant.
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:51.380]   That's a great grant.
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:59.780]   The idea is journalists will work with crowdsource editors and fact checkers and all sorts of
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:05.780]   stuff to create stories at wickitribune.com.
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:09.220]   I like that.
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:12.020]   New models for journalism.
[01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:13.460]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:14.460]   I appreciate it.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:20.460]   We do this show every Wednesday afternoon out 130 Pacific for 30 Eastern 2030 UTC.
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:25.740]   If you want to stop by, you can watch us live at Ustream Twitch YouTube.

[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:38.420]   in that behind the scenes conversation.
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:40.340]   We always love it when you're there.
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:41.580]   You can even join us in studio.
[01:59:41.580 --> 01:59:43.140]   Glenn came by.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.940]   Nice to see you, Glenn.

[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:55.780]   However, most people I know listen to the show whenever they want on demand after the
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:57.500]   fact and that's easy to do.
[01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:00.420]   You could subscribe in your favorite podcast application.

[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:13.140]   And I'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:13.620]   Bye bye.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:16.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
