[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.180]   Public parts and I'm like level - six on Pokemon go
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.440]   I think from now on when you are introduced you had to tell us your Oh, no, no look at that. Yeah, it's important. No, that's good
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.180]   It's new rule. Okay, I was trying I was hoping my you know I actually did do I went down the street
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.300]   I was just praying to get some beast on the New York Times logo and extras. Oh
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.380]   Yeah, that's the thing now is take pictures of Pokemon all over the place
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.860]   There's even one on number 10 Downing Street is David Cameron is leaving
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.340]   There's a Pokemon fairly moving in
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.860]   That's on the BBC feed Kevin Marks is also here. He is of course
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.060]   Kevin Marks the original
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.380]   We love Kevin. He worked at BBC and then at Apple Google
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.460]   BT he's been everywhere man. You say good. I'm named super three times apparently. Yeah, Kevin Marks Kevin Marks Kevin Marks
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.680]   I guess you could figure out from his name what his website and Twitter handle are
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.580]   Stacy has the week off Stacy Higabotham normally here. She's traveling and we are hoping soon that
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.620]   Are the the fourth or fourth member of our crew will join us Dan Lyons, of course?
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.260]   We love Dan the fake Steve Jobs. He wrote for a long time for Newsweek magazine then
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.380]   Had some misadventures and startup land. He wrote a book called disrupted all about it
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.180]   Then went to work for Silicon Valley the TV show his post today on
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.700]   Facebook says went to Hollywood got the jacket. He has yeah
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.660]   I as you said Jeff the best swag ever ever a pied piper jacket
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.460]   The jacket that is so hideous
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.140]   It made this this was kind of a highlight of season three. I think the jacket
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.380]   Anyway, where I'm Dan he said he's gonna be busy through July
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.940]   So it should be we should be you should be joining us soon. I hope I'm crossing our fingers anyway
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.380]   Still don't have a commitment. He may be he may be hedging his waiting to see if Hollywood calls or something like that
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.220]   So both of you I thought for sure this would be the first show. I've done all week that doesn't mention poke you might go
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.140]   I thought there's no way Jeff and Kevin. Yeah, there's no no not old just serious
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.740]   I thought there's no way these guys these are serious guys. They're playing this dumb game. How can you not?
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.900]   You were saying Jeff that you see people playing in Manhattan everywhere. Yes, it's it's really amazing because I walked on the street
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.920]   And now she's already standing there number one you can tell if they're doing the motion. Oh, yeah
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.820]   You can you really can tell because if somebody's playing Pokemon go screens. They keep their phone out
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.340]   Yeah, yeah, because they're waiting for the buzz that says a Pokemon is nearby. So if you're
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.580]   Like me and you were surreptitious. You're walking but your phone is there and when you feel the buzz then and
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.120]   Then you start seeing this as they play the game. Oh, I'm not just got a buzz and
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.300]   Seriously, and then so and then you start I'll show you I'll demonstrate the motion because I'm actually going to fight a wild
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:47.060]   Zubat and then you see this kind of finger-up motion as they shoot the pokey balls at the Zubat and
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.700]   Try to take it home for their collection
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.900]   So this game came out a week ago on on today on a week ago today on Wednesday afternoon
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.380]   Took everybody by surprise except I guess people were really paying close attention
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.860]   Somebody just got something something something appeared. Yeah, that's the cry of the wild something
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:18.340]   Yeah, so you hear their cry and then your Kevin's playing the game for the first time I'm a lousy show. Yeah, it's hard
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.800]   So you notice I turned off the augmented reality, which was
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.740]   Why I think that's one of the fun of it, isn't it? It's the fun of it, but it also saps battery life
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.580]   Oh boy does it? Yeah, cuz your cameras on all the time
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.740]   So you could turn that off and that will help and then it also it makes it a little bit harder
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.740]   I find it's easier at least for me without the V a augmented reality. There you go. You caught it Kevin nice
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.940]   So that's added to your pokey collection. You can now turn I was in Facebook's
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.260]   New York
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.340]   Oh goodness, you got an eek in the in X
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.180]   Snake spelled backwards
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.620]   Yeah, no, that's a really good one he can't he can't
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.940]   So keep the key to keep the he can't yeah, so your idea is you're gonna get these these are baby Pokemon that you evolve
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.300]   to stronger and stronger sometimes once or twice and then
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.220]   You got another one there's a bunch of them around your house
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.500]   That's because I just just signed up so they were easy ones, right?
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.520]   Yeah, necessarily usually you have to walk that's the the virtue of this game. I mean
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.020]   another version for Brits
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.620]   It's not it's only US Australia Canada
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.620]   Carson tell me his rolls out today in Germany, which is surprising because
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.780]   frankly
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.140]   The servers are very unreliable because so many people are signing up in those three countries in
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:49.100]   Niantic the company that made this which is a former Google company has said we're not gonna roll it out as fast as we thought globally
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.020]   However, the pro the thing people can do and I don't recommend this you can download on Android
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.580]   sideloading APK from one of you
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.940]   Can you turn that down?
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.500]   I never thought I'd say that
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.900]   a little too much
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.340]   Oh, you got away escaped that one escaped
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:20.560]   I'm gonna reduce my predictions about progress in the future by about a year and a half based on losing Kevin Marx's brain
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.220]   Not just not just Kevin
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.780]   But look at that
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:30.060]   I mean if if you see Kevin imagine all the brilliant people Elon Musk has announced there won't be a new Tesla because he's busy
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.500]   No, that's a joke. So here you can sideload it on Android, but also if you're on iOS
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:43.180]   Apparently I didn't this is kind of a loophole you can sign up for the US store and get it in any country apparently somebody
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.580]   on number 10 Downing Street has
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.380]   signed up because
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:58.580]   A wild Pokemon has been cited at the house of the Prime Minister outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron. There is a Pikachu a
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.780]   Pikachu right there in front of number 10
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.620]   Downing Street
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.420]   Well, not anymore. It's it's been captured. So there's yes. There's the good news
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:16.660]   It's the down in Street cap. So is this what happens by the way Kevin is the Prime Minister actually just moves out his whole family
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.980]   They just move out of the house. Yeah. Yeah, he's moved out, but do we know is who the new Prime Minister is?
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:27.420]   It is gonna be Theresa May so she is now is she now officially the Prime Minister? Yes
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.660]   She she bet the Queen she percie to the Queen this war. Oh, that's right. I remember that great scene from the movie
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.460]   Yeah
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:41.760]   There's a picture on line of her curtsy which made me think I the only reason I wish we had a queen is so that Donald Trump would have to
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.540]   Curtsy I'd like to see him crazy with those girly hands
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:55.780]   It is this weird thing. I mean it's it basically the leader of the largest party is the is the Prime Minister which
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:03.400]   Which means that if if if what happened here was Cameron resigned as as leader of the Conservative Party and this Prime Minister
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.980]   Which means there was a put election within his party and that was that ran last week
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.660]   And then over the weekend it was supposed to go to a ballot of all the members
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:17.500]   But the second place person dropped out which means Theresa May became it was it wasn't really an election even it was just
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.660]   By the MPs right by the not
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.100]   So there's a little at the bottom of other
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.120]   You heard
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.960]   Cameron's song as he walked back into ten downing right no I didn't go to the camera and cement
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.000]   This is just too British and too beautiful
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.280]   So so as he his mic was on as he walks back into number ten after saying goodbye
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.360]   Yes, basically, okay, and if you go to that, okay, so now
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.160]   Go to the one with a piano go to the one note
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.400]   This one you want to see you in here the original was that the original up there Kevin is it there?
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.960]   Is the original there this is fantasy sure the original is there so if you go to the one with the one word of the piano with a computer that
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.840]   One you'll see you'll hear it. So you want to turn the sound up and play this okay?
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.240]   Do it again he's got he goes in
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:18.640]   Right
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.560]   Do we recognize that or is it just but that well no no so now now watch where she does this
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.960]   But then you raises it to an e flat
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.480]   It's kind of out of two so I'm going to choose
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.760]   Because it's much nicer
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.480]   This is like Greek oh my god
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:46.400]   Lovely
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.440]   Midnight last night finishing a long day's composing and I checked my phone and saw that this is happening yesterday
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.120]   I kind of missed it
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.440]   You know how to listen to it and it instantly inspired this melody and and finishing the job as it were
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.160]   I mean the thing is about music you know music for me penetrates the heart in a way that sometimes words can't
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:14.120]   Actually, I was really struck with the response yesterday to his singing actually this guy who's running the country actually does have a heart
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.200]   You know any other promotions and whatever those emotions are people have different ideas as to what he was trying to
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:26.360]   Like you know he was miked right I mean he just what this was like a person going back to work
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   But I do that
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.400]   Of course he's going back to work is packing the house and getting out right
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.560]   Trying to book a moving company on two days notice the central London
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.640]   All right Jeff I see I see you pointing down oh
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   Is he I was trained up by Mike to listen to it go down one more just one more on the page
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.080]   Okay, the FUG camarata the fugue camarata
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.680]   Yeah, see it right on keep going right there. Yeah, let's hear this one
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.600]   Right
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.120]   Oh you have to say right
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   Oh
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:18.640]   This is why there will always be
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.980]   And a great great
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:27.240]   Wow, that's wonderful. I love it. Yeah, I do love that one of those weeks in England and then
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.480]   Theresa May has to curtsy to the Queen and walk out backwards afterwards and the Queen always carries her purse with her
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.840]   Which I think is an odd but kind of somewhat charming
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.440]   Effectation because you know be honest with you. What could be in there? Not money V V has a purse carrier
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.440]   You think the Queen could yeah?
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.520]   Was there was this this like a coded thanks a reference
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:56.360]   The Queen is is passing on the ceremony how back the ceremonial handbag
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.640]   It is said that I think it was who was it that said that to the to the to the Queen everything smells as fresh paint
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.860]   Yes, she never goes anywhere that isn't just painted
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.800]   Yes, the world smells of fresh paint. I think that was Alan Bennett. This is what
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.200]   Sounds like yeah, I love Alan Bennett. Oh my god. I love him. He is not well known in the US
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:26.080]   It's a shame. What is that movie they made about the woman the woman in the driveway? Yes
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.800]   Yeah, that's probably America's introduction Alan Bennett. Wow. Okay. Yeah, I know
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.360]   There's a lot more there, but yes, well that was a good film. Am I am I wrong?
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.040]   Does anybody know who Alan Bennett is? Okay, Chet room who do you know how to bet is?
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.880]   And yet they
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.400]   No, no one knows and yet the only reason I know is
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.560]   Because my mom gave me a book of his short stories and I fell in love
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.520]   With his stuff. He wrote the madness of George III which you might know
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.200]   But he is is quite a funny
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:09.600]   And of course and you know very literate he started with a cook and more I guess and Jonathan Miller and beyond
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.480]   Beyond the fringe was was was great and then they did
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.920]   Tw3 he wasn't involved in that as well. This was the week that was which was a great set it was again
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.240]   Nobody knows that in the US. I think how did your mother know it is 50 years ago?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:29.160]   Well, we only know what we only know British stuff that we've done ourselves like the office, you know that we've remade
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.800]   Yeah
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:37.520]   And you can't really couldn't really remake Alan Bennett stuff. It would work. Yeah, it's too British. See you doing the history boys or something
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah wouldn't map. Yeah, what would you recommend for somebody? I think I have the Alan Bennett reader
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.280]   I think yeah, really is it really is stories is he writes wonderfully and it has it has this tone
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.360]   I mean, but he's done I actually would actually recommend seeing the film that will get this decide whether you
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.240]   You like his his style was that that was very in his style. Yeah
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.820]   But really like we done for film, please don't have lots of television stuff as well
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.000]   Hey, he used it when I was working in London. He was he lived around the corner from our offices
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.680]   So we really see him in the cafe the movie is called the lady in the van
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.140]   Yes, and
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:19.400]   Maggie Smith is the lady in the van and it's a true story right about a woman who lived in his driveway for some time. Yeah
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.940]   Yeah, yes
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:30.940]   Yes, she was she was
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.300]   Pops his fan outside the street and its neighbors kept trying to move the wrong and he said well
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.860]   You could park on my driveway for a bit and they should just stay stayed stayed
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:45.500]   Yes, it's again. There will always be a British I I hope the God. What's your take on Brexit?
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.720]   Actually, we haven't talked to you Kevin Mark. Oh, that's right
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   Okay, well
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.460]   It's one of those things it's like
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.700]   No one was expecting this to happen
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.860]   They were think what what I think what happened was they were trying to replay what happened in 1975
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.820]   So if you remember night you you I remember
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:10.340]   And the debate over whether to join the EU yes now. There's there's a wonderful photograph which I will try and find for you
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:17.900]   Which is Margaret Thatcher who had just become leader of the opposition campaigning for being in the European Union?
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.860]   I I I've posted I think I've seen it
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.120]   Where are me photos?
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:34.040]   So the bon is in 1975 if you actually read about the 975 referendum is almost exactly the same she had a really ugly sweater
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.120]   Right she had a really ugly sweater and a I think we have it you have it
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.560]   Yeah, look at mine. Look at mine. Look at mine. Get the go go back one. There's there's a better one as a poster as well
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.900]   That's one yes support your local continent
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.140]   And then there's a little UK
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.420]   Is not on the continent
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.020]   Well, no, that's why this could support your local continent in the UK you say the continent is
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.940]   You're you yeah, yeah, I mean we're on now you know they are
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.420]   Content with shelf and and and we are on that we are on part of the continent
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:16.940]   But yes in the UK you refer to the rest of Europe as the continent in right not ironically
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.100]   To say oh, no, it's the continent over there across the post on this
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.780]   We're across the pond. They're the continent. Yes, so
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:32.260]   But but if you actually read the history of the 975 referendum the parallel is almost exact basically Wilson
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.140]   Had just won the election
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.220]   There was some contention within his part about wanting to join or leave the European Union
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.500]   So they had this referendum they let the cabinet campaign on both sides
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.260]   But they got the leader of the opposition to campaign with the prime minister to say we think this is a good thing
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.260]   And hence that picture of Thatcher doing that
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.180]   So I imagine some civil servant someone said what if this how you do it?
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:00.460]   Look, he does before or some campaign or some to camera into this and then it didn't work because
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.180]   a
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.780]   the position didn't really line up and and
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:11.420]   Campaign with him though most of the labor members did labor supporters did vote for remaining
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.700]   the conservative party split itself very very broadly
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:23.060]   And then there's you keep which has been making hay with this issue for years and Nigel Farage after winning says okay
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.860]   I'm done here. My work is done here. Good luck. We'll see you later
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.420]   Christ and that was
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:37.520]   That's that is the height and you know what we may have the same thing because there's some speculation that mr
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.500]   Trump should he win election as president will then resign
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.700]   That was Howard Stern's platform. You know what he was wearing for governor of New York
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.140]   Yeah, it was three things and then he was gonna quit Larry Lessig as well
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:56.180]   The only way I the only interest I haven't winning the presidency and the only way we can change how campaigns work in this country
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.380]   Is if I win I can with executive fiat eliminate campaign, you know
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.540]   This campaign farce
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:10.540]   With funding make all funding federal and then resign to I'll choose a very good vice president
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.020]   That's why we'll watch with interest on Friday to see who is going to be the next president
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:24.780]   So yes, but the other thing is that basically the two things were conflated and this is this is why it's a complete mess
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.220]   They can't unpigged which is that there is the
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.300]   The issue of
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:41.540]   Much is there too much migration and the issue of should be trade with Europe and all this stuff was like tied up together
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.740]   So a lot of the people who are voting for leave were actually voting. I'm fed up with Westminster
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.020]   I'm fed up with being you know you sub and it's telling us what to do
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.620]   something anything something must be better than this and
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:20:01.060]   You know the the sort of the dog whistles about immigration and so on and the scare taxes that they put together
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.300]   The thing is that there's no way to be part of the EU
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.300]   To be able to trade with the EU without free movement of people
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.540]   That's part one of the four things that you have to agree to to actually get free trade rejected free trade in effect
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.700]   You got a you got a one that they haven't it's not clear. So you
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.140]   Pretty clear. It's pretty clear that the EU is going to say yeah
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:27.300]   Well, if you that's about that enough of that we're not gonna make that deal in fact
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:34.900]   Who was it? I think was Ian Thompson from the register who was on Twitch surely after Brexit who said the the EU is at great pains now
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.020]   Cuz if if Britain succeeds that is sends a terrible message
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:44.500]   So it must not succeed there are not going to make a favorable deal with Britain because that would
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.180]   Encourage others to leave Brexit to leave to exit the EU. But that's the but the challenge is yeah
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:55.460]   We're in this constitutional gap. I mean the other thing is that may just appointed Boris Johnson as foreign minister
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.040]   And appointed another I didn't hear that David Davis as minister for Brexit
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.260]   Oh, I didn't hear that Boris Johnson as foreign minister. Yeah
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.220]   So that was Theresa May pro Brexit
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:17.940]   I mean I don't think she was through his first day, but not not
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:23.580]   Much noise about it. She was quiet. Yeah. Yeah, so she's the best that they could come up with
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:32.260]   But meanwhile Boris Johnson is absolutely pro Brexit is now foreign minister. Will he be doing the negotiation?
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.020]   Goodness knows
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.740]   You know we with the they literally you know, do you know what there was gonna go on?
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.740]   They're still trying to work out what the implications are
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:48.100]   They they're the only clear thing is article 50, which is once they once the British Prime Minister says okay
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.660]   We're officially leaving EU then that starts a two-year clock at which point
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:58.020]   The negotiations over what happened next have to be concluded us know
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:04.740]   But there's there's back and forth between do we try and negotiate before we trigger this and the EU saying no
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.500]   You don't get to do that and Britain say whether we're a trigger it and this year
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.260]   so there's like 16 kinds of bringmanship going on and
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:17.580]   And then it's just like every day there's something even more surreal we had
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.980]   Jean called Jean Claude Juncker saying
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.420]   alien's mother planets don't want
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.620]   Worried about Brexit or something
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:34.460]   Mars has decided to leave the federation. He was speaking in French, but he definitely said water a planet
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:43.460]   And people watching us from afar. So it's like I think he had too much wine or he was just there are people who really believe that that's going on
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:49.220]   There's that each day I read the news from the UK and I'm like no that didn't just happen didn't it?
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:57.420]   Yeah, by the way, there is good news. It's very cheap. Yeah, it's good to it's cheap to travel the pound is weakening by the moment and
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.420]   We now can use three
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:06.460]   The British carrier three on our project five phones. Yes, that's huge and and
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:14.140]   Yeah, we'll get full a full rate you pay the to it's not free as it is with T mobile, but unlike T mobile
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.820]   They're not gaining it
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.660]   It's full LTE if that's available because you'll be paying the same ten dollars per gigabyte that you're paying in the
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:26.380]   It's I've taken my five phone now for a number of international trips all in all
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:32.220]   Has worked very well and just I can now cancel that hundred dollar a month thing. I pay
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.020]   In the case I use me to man with my baby
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.700]   18 T phone
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:44.700]   Phi is the Phi is now clearly the way to travel and essentially what Google is doing by making these deals with carriers around the world
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   15 countries is
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.780]   Making it all local because it's the same billing the same process the same cost
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:58.620]   It would matter which of those 15 countries you're in so that's huge is how about calling is calling the same?
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.980]   Calling is it expensive?
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.960]   Yeah, I forgot what the deal is so there's no longer
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.860]   Because I did the entire Mexico City show get your bill any money five oh my god
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.700]   Hey, it seriously sent us the bill. No, no, we find it will be right if it's big sent us the bill
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.580]   We'll you know if a small you could take care of it
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.540]   But I don't want you to shoulder a big burden in
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.780]   So
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:31.980]   To be clear Phi is available in 135 countries because they use T mobile and Sprint which have global networks
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   Right, but when you're using five actually pretty good T mobile's great, but it's not full speed. That's the difference
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.660]   But but but it was but you didn't you don't actually pay for it, which was good right and they had some notion
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:48.460]   You can upgrade to faster, but it never actually worked. Yeah, I did it you pay for more and it wasn't very good
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.980]   Oh, you actually managed to get it. I couldn't actually you know
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.580]   I would say you could upgrade and I click a button and it would just sit there and look
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.420]   Oh, no, no, yeah, I got it in Germany probably because it's Deutsche Telekom
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:02.860]   I was able to do it in Germany and I think in maybe also in Austria, but
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:09.220]   It wasn't that fast and you paid money for it and it ran out very quickly because it was by bite not by time
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:15.580]   But this way there's not none. It's none of that stuff you get as much speed as you can get on that carrier
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:21.260]   Three's a pretty good carrier in the UK. What is that that's a it's it's two companies together, right?
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.300]   It's T is a T Deutsche Telekom and BT or I can't remember what it is, but it's not BT
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.460]   Anyway
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.860]   orange no
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.460]   But they I mean the UK has always had a like a
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.060]   Very easy swap the same in market
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:43.060]   You can basically get them in any sweet shop and put a new sim in and then recharge it over the counter there
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   I've used three before and I was very happy I had a Wi-Fi card
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.820]   Last time I've used and they have little vending machines from the airport
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.740]   So there's it's it's it is straightforward to swap stuff there, but this does make it easier and
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.100]   Well, it's huge it means if you are traveling especially if you're traveling in those 15 countries
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.180]   You must get a Nexus phone and get by service
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:10.300]   Fies no longer in fire and other advantages my AT&T doesn't know because I'm on grandfather unlimited
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.020]   I can't do tethering whereas with the iPhone I can tether oh nice
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.780]   Again you pay ten dollars per gigabyte, but that's not a lot of it couldn't be more reasonable happy to pay
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.060]   Tethering is a bit tricky. Yeah, because once you tether then you're
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.720]   Whatever else you are and thinks his own wife and it's like we let's just
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:38.140]   There should be a setting that says I'm on a metered connection even though you think it's Wi-Fi is metered
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.540]   But you know I think I complained about it when I was in Mexico City, but I went to a phone store
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.860]   I can play in taking four hours to the literally four hours
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.900]   I tried to buy a my fi try to get it working the speed was awful
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.700]   I mean and and that is a solution country to country to country is
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.900]   is
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.220]   Untenable now once Europe gets rid of roaming
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.140]   Well ironically zoom will Britain be a part of that now. No, I guess not
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:10.260]   So that is gonna that is a new EU rule that there should be no cost to roaming within the EU
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.900]   So so my father was I could buy a UK
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.500]   Wi-Fi use it all over Europe, but ha ha ha
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.620]   Hmm
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.140]   Well, I'm gonna be I'm gonna be doing it still true. This can be true for at least two years
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.980]   I'm bringing my T-Mobile phone. We're going to Europe in September. I'm bringing my T-Mobile phone
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:34.100]   Actually, we're going to the ball tick so I will see what happens here. So we're starting Paris Sweden
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:39.660]   Saint Petersburg lot via Riga lot via Talon the stony. I'm gonna try to get my
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.340]   International identity card in Talon while we're there
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.420]   Tony and digital citizenship wouldn't that be fun? It has it has a
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.500]   PGP key on it. That's your I mean, it's really an interesting idea
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:58.220]   Are you taking a cruise? I assume this idea. Yeah, yeah, and then we're gonna go to Bruges and Amsterdam and then to Southampton
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:05.120]   So I will try all of those countries as we just to see Tuesday. It must be Bruges. I like you know what the nice thing
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   I I
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.100]   If you're on a cruise ship, it's different. It's a different experience because you don't unpack
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:16.420]   You are you unpack once so it's almost as if you're in a hotel room and the country's come to you
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:22.920]   It's a very different experience than being on a tour where you're you know constantly unpacking unpacking
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.620]   We do the official land activities or you go up on your own. It varies
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:33.580]   Sometimes we do sometimes we don't in this case. We're on a kind of high-end cruise line. We're on region seven seas. So the
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:41.340]   The they call them excursions are very nice. This is a PBS cruise to so there'll be PBS people
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.860]   Oh house naughty of you. I know so you see you get to watch in Bruges
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.960]   I know I let one you know what the only reason I want to go to Bruges is because of that movie
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:55.880]   I'm hoping there'll be no gangsters there at this juncture. That's a great movie by the way. It's a great movie and Bruges looks beautiful
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.880]   It's a medieval town. So yeah
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:03.460]   You know, I'm not going to Brussels. I have no interest in going to Brussels. No, believe me
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.020]   You do not want to go to that airport now. Yeah, well, this is the beauty of it
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:12.020]   You you fly to Stockholm and then you're on a boat which you never you know unpack or
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:16.860]   Pack and then you get off in here in Southampton and we have to get out of go out of Heathrow with that's all right
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:22.380]   The stock home the Stooler a half restaurant. Oh good. I was looking for recommendations
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.480]   What are my favorites?
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.680]   One of my send me the link or the name of it because I don't understand
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:35.740]   Stice it there and and just have I love my hearing see I'm not a big you're gonna have to convince me on the hearing
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.400]   Oh, we have my five favorite flavors of Harry. No, you know American can there's only one. I'm sorry. I'm sorry
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   There's only one flavor of airing
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.180]   You can claim five
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:58.860]   Bill Harry and that wonderful cheese and a beer. Oh, what is it ST? How do you spell the restaurant ST you are E
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.240]   HOF store off store off store off all right. I'll go there
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.620]   Go to the balls that you would be hearing you know basically which I know I'm not a fan to be honest of Scandinavia
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.700]   You gotta try it right up all right. Oh, hey fish fish. Oh
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.700]   Not a fan
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:19.060]   Meatballs meatballs I could yeah, but I mean I've had enough meatballs at IKEA that I'm not anxious
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.820]   To experience more meat. Oh, I love I love Scandinavia. Oh the little the
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:30.020]   Stand with the sandwiches. Oh, oh yeah the smorgasch boy. I love
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:37.580]   Scandinavia if I could move somewhere I would move to yes see this I'm looking at this meal does not appeal
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:46.820]   Yeah, they have they have things like steaks - yeah, well, I don't you know now mostly I eat
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.380]   salads, so I'm sure they have lovely salad. Oh
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.740]   Oh
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.340]   Yeah, one of them what does sure Hoff mean something house?
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.100]   It's on the and the store as the name of the store house
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.660]   Maybe yes, I might jump
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.900]   Anyway, enough of my travels
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:15.380]   So that's good news though, and I will report back with the Google fly will bring my five phone now
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.780]   I may have a new five phone right because we're the fee five phone. Oh, let's hope let's hope I
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.700]   Didn't realize it. I bet you that's why they named it five phone
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.540]   fee five phone
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.940]   Maybe the next five should be a fee
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.900]   Hey, we hear there will be new next I in that timeframe, right?
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:38.540]   Sounds extremely puzzle because we're seeing already renders and
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.100]   You know leaks and stuff
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:49.060]   Probably the I'm so happy with a six-p. Yeah, it's hard to you know, and I'll be a schmuck and I'll buy it like you do
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.060]   I'm so happy with my six P the six piece excellent and by the way
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.140]   Even if you upgraded to nougat we have a name
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.500]   Where'd the nougat go?
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   Did somebody eat all our nougat?
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500]   We had nougat
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:09.620]   From last night from all about Android they have nougat they always have the candy of the of the week
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.260]   but no I as of
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.540]   Earlier today
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:19.940]   It's I have I'm happy to report that Pokemon go will work on nougat. It didn't all
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:27.860]   Didn't but it now will work on nougat. They say maybe August and we're saying renders
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.860]   What do we think what do we think it's gonna be?
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:37.620]   We think it's made by HTC this time around there's two phones two different sizes
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.740]   Sailfish and Marlin
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:48.860]   Everybody seems to agree all we've seen is renders in fact Android police has a as a render
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.020]   But based on description
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:56.980]   The thing that was kind of interesting on these is this dual two tone back. So there's glossy up top
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.500]   probably a plastic for
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:07.180]   The camera which is hidden behind that by the oh no, I guess there's the cameras again. This is a render
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:13.020]   This is not this is just based on descriptions same fingerprint reader on the back. I suspect they'll be very similar
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:18.220]   Faster processor. I'd like to see more RAM. I'd like to see better battery life, right?
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.620]   Yeah
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.740]   Yeah, well something I think Pokemon is doing deaths for my battery. Oh, think
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:31.100]   No, although I'm using the my daily driver now is the one plus three. I love
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.980]   And you know obviously price is not for me a determining
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:41.820]   Factor but I but I've got fairly good battery life even with Pokemon go running. It only maybe takes 40% of my
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.340]   In a one-hour walk
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:52.700]   Yeah, do I have to actually kill it to stop them doing that? Yeah, you should because it kind of runs in the background. Yeah
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.300]   Okay, so yeah, I'm great
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.900]   I'm just gonna say I'm just going so often so I don't actually want to dead phone by the time I get there
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.520]   Yeah, because it because it will refuse to let me do anything on the trade matrix that's going to first
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   Where did the nougat go karsten do you know?
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.620]   Where's the nougat Chris? Can you find the nougat? I want to show cars karsten is chewing right now
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:19.340]   For you it is like that though. You got rid of the evidence. We got the Italian version, which is taroni, which is really good
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.560]   That's nice. I grew up on where it is, but it was delicious
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.700]   we used to go down to the corner store in Providence and
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:34.020]   For a quarter you'd get the yellow box of taroni it was really good and this is it's delicious. It's good
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.540]   So it's egg white and nuts and sometimes dried fruit and it's quite delicious
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.940]   I can't believe it's all gone. There were at least 10 pieces left when I got here this morning
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.940]   Oh
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:49.860]   Well so somewhere in that office or somebody with tail between the ones yeah, it's always crumbs down
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:55.240]   Anyway, it's Android nougat which is kind of what I was expecting to be honest
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.000]   I was being facetious. We'll be the announcer contest for it. Then they're like cool at that anyway
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.340]   It was obvious
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.860]   It was you know that the only question was would they go with a brand name if they would obviously need to tell
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.140]   I but I'm glad they would went with something
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.820]   And also it's international right nougat is an international treat
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.540]   Yes, it's just smart
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:20.380]   Originally French I believe although many countries in the European Union have their own version Italy in Germany
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:26.480]   It's like fruitcakes. Yeah, like fruitcake. It is kind of a fruitcake candy fruitcake candy
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.060]   Marlin is the high end the Nexus M1 it'll have the
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:36.220]   Course both of these will ship with the release version of nougat the Qualcomm 821
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:42.780]   According to sources 4 gigs. This is Android police 4 gigs of RAM 128 gigs of memory that would be nice
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.980]   At least they say
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:49.840]   Adreno 530 graphics 12 megapixel camera 8 megapixel front
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.040]   Nexus phones of course have type C. Oh, I
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.980]   See a nougat box coming is it an empty nougat box? No, yay, that's not nougat
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.060]   This is nougat
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:06.580]   Somebody for some reason they have some big hunk which I don't consider nougat. This is the nougat
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.500]   This is just for people who want to know this is Ferrara, which is an Italian
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.140]   nougat
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:20.620]   Toroni and I'll just show you so you can speak authoritatively some people say oh, you know the nougat inside of a Mars bar or something
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:27.940]   That's not nougat. No, that's not nougat. This is nougat my friends. What kind of no? I think it's almonds. Yeah
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   It's quite tasty
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.100]   Are you most of the most ridiculous unboxing I've ever seen
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.300]   Nougat unboxing
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:45.340]   I should totally do that and do breathlessly keep them waiting for like five minutes. Okay
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.380]   We have it here as you just did you're showing every angle
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:55.780]   Yeah, it's a habit. Yeah, let me read the material on the back of Cremona Italy in 1441 at the wedding a Francesco
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:02.380]   Sortsa to Bianca Marie of Escondi the buffet featured a suite made of
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.660]   Nut Meats
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.220]   Honey and egg whites in the shape of the famous Tower of Cremona
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.660]   Toroni hence the name
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.820]   Toroni
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.660]   from Ferrara
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.660]   since 1892
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:24.580]   Anyway, I can't eat it, but I'll put it there for you to look at
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.100]   This is kind of stale nougat. I don't know where we got this, but it's kind of stale
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:35.940]   Do we cover the most important stories of the day or not I ask you surprise you all right
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.820]   I'm so are you guys running on you sit on I put nougat immediately on my 6p
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:47.340]   I've got it on my 6p my 6 if it's not a daily driver. I wouldn't do it as a daily driver
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.060]   So there are a lot of apps don't work with it. It seems really reliable
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.980]   Things just suddenly decide to quit again and again and again again. You gotta say okay. Yeah, but I
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:01.060]   Love the I love the notifications. I love the bill believe operate within a notification. It's great
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.800]   It's interesting because iOS is doing exactly the same thing and it's next version iOS
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.620]   9 or 10 do you use the split screen at all?
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.100]   Never
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.260]   No, I think that's a tablet thing more than I barely remember it's there and then
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.660]   After I've been copying and basing back and forth
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.860]   Yeah, the double click the switch is quite good
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:25.620]   But the split screen I do like the double click to switch and people don't necessarily see that you have to force hold or long
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.820]   on press the recent button
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.460]   And yeah double click to switch between the last two and then long press and get to split screen
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.040]   Yeah, yeah, I did I didn't know about until I saw them demo on stage at Google right
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.740]   So yeah
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.420]   So I don't think the next to be honest. I think the 6p and 5x are
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:47.580]   Fine, I don't think the next nexus will be particularly different
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:53.460]   So I would stick with what you got there won't be that's probably the one I'll be bringing to Europe
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.500]   I can't but you know, I guess I have to get the new one just to look at it
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.700]   Well, I mean the only thing I'm wondering is if they do smarter things with more cameras
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:05.260]   But that which is you know predicted last year and that's what happens is suppose it's apparently gonna do with it
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.020]   It's next you know the obvious thing is you put a second camera here
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.340]   Then you got a stereo microscopic camera, right?
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.500]   Or you beef up the front and back cameras so you can actually do a 360
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.460]   Moving it that way. Yeah, so a little bit of work like that and suddenly you've got a
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.740]   Thing that will let you gather the 3d stuff
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.220]   Also, if you've actually got us if you put the stereoscopic camera there
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:32.820]   Then once it's in the in the headset the AR actually becomes stereoscopic which is the difference. Oh good point
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:38.540]   If anybody were were to do a 360 camera on a phone it would be Google after all. I mean they support this
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.940]   they supported this with with
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:45.900]   cardboard before anybody did yeah, so you know I suspect part of it is that
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:51.820]   They want to push this forward they announced the cardboard successor which I've got them the the name for
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:58.100]   At IO with the for the for the VR staff obviously they want reference devices for that
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:02.780]   And they'll be pushing that stuff so you know and then yeah, there is an obvious AR
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:07.660]   Thing of stop your phone she hadn't had the camera operating which is that that's a dream right?
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.220]   That's what they're calling day dream that's it. I can never know
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.460]   but
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:17.300]   And they've also got other like stuff that they've talked about which is the AR based on magic magic leap
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:22.340]   But but the point is that if you think about yeah
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:28.660]   The natural extension of the this there are things in the world thing is you're wearing it over your head
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.660]   And you can see the things in the world
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:36.740]   And as long as they're not like bigger than the thing you're trying to walk in front of that that makes them sense
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.700]   The daydream is really a speck for others to adopt it
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:46.260]   So so similar to Samsung's gear VR you have the gear VR 360 cam
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.500]   Jeff Jarvis
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.500]   Yes, I do you don't anything with that yet
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.460]   Play with us on I went to VidCon I did the wrong thing. It's just must be very stable with it
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:00.780]   I walked through the entire yeah, it makes people sick. Yeah, but it was fun to do. Did you post that somewhere?
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   I can show it no I have a post you okay
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.700]   Well you can do that, but you need it. Oh you need it on some kind of steady map. Yeah, yeah
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.980]   Well, it's a judicious motion
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:15.420]   Please yes, right when care when Casey Neistat was at the Oscars
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.020]   He just kind of walked with it as if you were carrying a chalice to the pope
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.060]   Very carefully
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.900]   It is that you don't need to point see you can just hold it
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:30.340]   That's the that's the thing that takes so long to get used to I'm so used to pointing a camera at the subject
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:36.780]   And eventually I finally got it with the Rico theta s which I love just hold it doesn't matter where you hold it
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.660]   Right well it does not know it does matter for where the stitches
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.980]   So you don't want to hold it this way. Can you see this ditch? I'll be stitched. Oh, yeah, you can see the
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.820]   Camera that's
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.980]   Right the Rico. I don't see stitching at all
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:58.380]   Well, this is why you have the 16 camera rigs, but then yeah hold on a second hero. So they're a bit out of the camera
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:07.820]   Oh, you're doing it now. That's okay. So that's something cool. You could do that live the Rico just recently added that feature
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.220]   That's one view. That's kind of neat the idea being
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.180]   That you could
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:20.180]   Somebody could be at home wearing their gear VR their Samsung virtual reality headset and you could stream to them
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.860]   And of course at Samsung's event earlier this year they showed
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:29.060]   You know of some friends in Paris carrying the camera and then their friend at home who couldn't go
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.860]   Along for the ride don't move the camera move the phone. I know
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:48.480]   Back to the phones about Kevin's point is that I you know and I'll go back to my to the fable not yet arrived me
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.540]   Vogue
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.860]   Shooting at 150 degrees and what you can do with a wide
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:59.340]   Shot like that in terms of cutting things up and editing afterwards and all kinds of neat things
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.160]   I think that's where where phone cameras go next is is wider angle
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.740]   Yeah
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:12.340]   That's also part of this. I mean the point of having putting more lenses on there is that it gives you that much more control
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.540]   So you could put in you know instead of instead of
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:25.220]   So the trick there was it's a 4k lens, but then you can crop it to zoom effectively, right? That was the yes this camera apparently
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.380]   The ZTE acts on seven which just went on pre-order today, which means I better pre-order it
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.420]   Supports is the first phone to support
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:39.940]   Daydream out of the box. Oh really? Yeah, this is from China's ZTE
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:45.220]   Front-facing camera. I mean speakers which I love and I wish
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:50.420]   Even HTC has abandoned that 20 megapixel camera 4k video
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.540]   The key though in sporting daydream is gonna be this screen, isn't it?
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:59.060]   It's gonna be you need a 4k screen you need enough for enough resolution and of course you need enough
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:04.940]   This is a 4k screen. Oh, yeah, and you need enough graphics. I guess the dream of 530 which is in this is sufficient
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.540]   Yeah, no you put your new more GP power for it really yeah, right that's the key on it
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.140]   You see it's cardboard you like this looks a lot
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:18.540]   You know it's got the back of the box fingerprint scanner which I think we've now come to agree is probably the best place to put that right
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.020]   My one plus three has it on the front
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.940]   Dual sin which sim which is the key and up to 128 gig SD
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:35.740]   The dual sim is key for developing nations India for instance has so many carriers that you might switch carriers going from town to town so
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.660]   Right
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.980]   Seems is another reason for fire to get it's to get its business together right yes
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.500]   I'll order one of these
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:49.340]   They don't I'm not seeing where the screen resolution is but obviously it has to be for it'll be a focus
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:55.460]   It has to be you can't do it otherwise. That's one thing. That's one of the reasons this one plus three is a 400 dollar
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:02.060]   Phone fully featured you know I mean this is definitely a flagship phone in every respect except 1080p screen
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:10.900]   So you will never put this in a VR headset okay, but that doesn't mean that how is the battery life right great battery life?
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.740]   You know 18 hour battery life really nice phone and 400 bucks
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:20.660]   So for somebody who doesn't want to do VR this is a really good choice fingerprint reader is on the front
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:25.660]   I I think Google really nailed it by putting it on the back there. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.580]   Let me just see what the price is on the axon
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.180]   7
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.980]   Through a 400 bucks
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.980]   So they're doing the same thing
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.860]   They're doing the same thing and you can get it gold I guess I'll get gold right
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.920]   Why not or quartz gray you have to wait a little longer to get in gold
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.880]   Oh
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.460]   So that is just one of those that was the other interesting
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:53.440]   Nougat feature is the screen size. Wait a minute new what?
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.460]   Nougat nougat. How do you say?
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.800]   Nougat nougat nougat nougat nougat you're saying it Frenchie style
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.860]   Country country that's fairly close to France. You also see a restaurant. Oh used to be
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:15.640]   Nougat nougat nougat have to start saying nugget nugget it's nugget nougat nougat
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:20.080]   And nougat anyway, um, but that was I don't remember this feature
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.720]   But you can actually change the zoom the display zoom on your on your device
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.320]   which
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.920]   Means which is great if you if you're actually old and have bad eyesight
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.240]   And you got press be open you need bigger text and you can switch that in the OS now
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.880]   So that's that's something that they change here. I love that
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.560]   But I want that, you know, that's the thing I want on the Nexus 7 because the Nexus 7 could do with being that little bit bigger
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.600]   visually
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.880]   Yeah, and some of the time so that's it but
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.760]   But it's neat it works and it it's the one thing that changed the text size and Facebook is Facebook and also the system text size
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.720]   So if you actually want to be able to read Facebook and
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:05.440]   You're short-sighted you have to switch it the system because Facebook hates people with bad eyesight. Don't we all?
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.880]   Don't we all know I I'm the same way exactly
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.600]   All right, I'm gonna pre-order this real quickly just to
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.480]   Just for for completeness. I'm a completist
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:25.960]   So continue talking don't
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:34.200]   I'm pushing buttons and entering credit card numbers if you don't mind right now. Oh
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   Yeah
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:42.580]   Well, I just saw that this is just one I'm gonna buy more on the air or off the
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:47.240]   No, it's all the same to me. No, I just saw that it went it went
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:54.520]   Public sale right now. So you what you gotta it's like Pokemon. You gotta get them while you can
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.280]   Let me use Amazon payments that'll save some time
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.320]   There you go
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:08.640]   Cool I said, you know what that's interesting. That's a that's a good a good price
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:14.000]   400 that I wonder if that's gonna be the new
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.080]   That's a good price. Yeah, I wonder if that's gonna be the Google could do they did it before remember is they have a bunch more price
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:25.640]   Of yeah, they could they could go back at that. Oh, that would be nice. Wouldn't it? Yeah
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:33.000]   No, but yeah between the metal rather ones and the and the nexus is that was that was a very good run of good prices, you know
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.240]   well, and really it was a case of
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:41.400]   Thinking of the phone as a developer phone not as a
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.440]   user end user phone
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.320]   Would you say this 6p and 5x really are more aimed at the end user than the developer?
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.480]   I don't know. I haven't
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.680]   I'm the shopping the shops and seeing where they were they sell them
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:00.280]   But certainly the nexus line they sell in you know, they sell the main spot and one of the changes is Google 5
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:06.040]   Because you have to have an excess phone to use Google 5 and so I would guess that in fact
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.600]   That's the way you get Google 5 is buying an excess phone or buying 5 and then you get an excess phone
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.760]   I would guess that that's really changed the equation a little bit
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.200]   It's not a developer phone because now Google's in the phone business
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:28.760]   What about project tango will should the new phones be project tango enabled tango seems to me such a specialized I think it is
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   Thing like it's powerful
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.240]   Yeah, and and I've a long said I can't I you know people people with blindness and things like that
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.920]   It'll be phenomenal to map inside spaces and
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:44.560]   And find you lost things into all kinds of great things, but I think it's a it's a
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.360]   It's not gonna be a consumer party for a long time
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:54.200]   Google remember has wanted to build the bio dome space campus and
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:02.440]   Has been thwarted time and time again. Well, it may be a reality now. They just made a slant swap with LinkedIn
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.400]   I
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.040]   Guess now that LinkedIn is a Microsoft company. They're all moving to Redmond anyway. I don't know
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:13.680]   They actually looked at us building a new property on there in Mountain View in my view, but they've also been they moved
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.520]   They're off the office at San Francisco
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.480]   So that they did an ex a big chunk of land there near the old office
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.520]   And then they put that paid technically for San Francisco Silicon Valley business journal with the scoop
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.200]   They say that a few million square feet of real estate
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.960]   will with a property swap will become Google's and
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.000]   That this will be sufficient to
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.440]   build the master plan
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:46.040]   Well, it isn't part of it is that is getting stuff that zone differently. Yeah, that's what I thought
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.440]   I thought that they had been turned down by Mountain View
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:54.640]   Yeah, Google. Yeah. Yes. Well, it's a whole big thing. This allows them to consolidate services on LinkedIn
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:01.960]   I think has like shopping center and restaurants and all kinds of things. They had you're right LinkedIn plans for a new office plus retail promenade in Mountain View
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:10.280]   Now maybe because some of this property is in Sunnyvale now not just Mountain View. There's some of the LinkedIn property. Maybe that's
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:16.120]   Somehow part of the issue with consolidate. Then I think there's transit things they need to do. Yeah, it's still good. Yeah
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.120]   I'm thinking about it
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.300]   The housing situation throughout that area is is awful and there ought to be
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.220]   High rises going in by the train lines dammit
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:33.040]   Yeah LinkedIn had a prior approval from the city council because that's where they were gonna put their shoreline
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:43.680]   For 1.4 million square feet of office space so presumably that at least this business journal says that those approvals will transfer to Google as well
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.640]   I
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.280]   Wonder how that deal happened, you know, who sat down with who I imagine the negotiation
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.840]   LinkedIn acquires ownership of
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:58.220]   I've vision a monopoly board and say okay. I'll trade you. Yeah, like kind of like that, right?
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:05.040]   All right, I will give you the word monopoly around those I will give you 700 eight-mister middle field road for
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.600]   property
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   the old gold's gym I
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.560]   Am gonna need more than that all right. I'll give you 800 mmm field as well
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.920]   But then I would also like to get the property 1431 Plymouth
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.360]   Was there cash? No, it was a straight-up trade real
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:29.600]   Apparently the pop there's the sports page. There's one pub south of one sports page. They call it the sports page property
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   That's the old gold's gym. It's a dive bar
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.440]   Yeah
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.520]   But it's like it's the only pub that side of the of the freeway
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.680]   So it's where you go to drink the people did not be on Google premises. Well, guess what?
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:50.480]   Guess what Google now owns all of Mountain View congratulations Google. Oh no all of my piece of the one-on-one
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.440]   I think yeah, so I'm not joking. It's all of Mountain View south of one-on-one
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:59.160]   What's the one-on-one and then Easter one-on-one is like gonna be the other side of the tracks
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.920]   Which one of you? Wow? He's the one-on-one basically a base-sided one-on-one
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.440]   It's just like one-on-one is kind of diagonal
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:11.560]   Also apparently and this I would be interested in Google's working on new Android wear watches
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.560]   They've never made their own Android wear watch
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.960]   According to Android place these watches would come out at the same time as the new next eye
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:24.400]   But not sure what features angel fish and swordfish are the codes, but
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:29.840]   one the speculation is it will be very voice assistant
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:36.680]   Yes, I was ready to give up on my on my Android wear that this one is dying every day about six o'clock and just
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   Oh, that's not out plus they won't give it the update. Oh, it's really awful. So I was thinking okay
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.720]   I'm where the LG a lot. I like the LG a lot, but it's clunky as hell
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:52.140]   I buy you more the LG every day until I got all my stuff stolen on the train and lost the charge of
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:57.940]   Oh, oh no, I hate proprietary chargers. It's what you get for taking public transit
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.440]   Be a California take a car, but I'm sorry Kevin. I'm right. She don't mean to be me fun. Yeah, that sucks
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:07.440]   There'll be two sizes of my bike having a bit stolen from it, too
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:14.340]   These are renders we should say this is another this is what Android police does they take the rumor
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:20.400]   We're making up something. Yeah. Well, they've got the this the picture is not the key
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.680]   It's the pros that goes along with it. So they are gonna be round and not square. Yeah
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.200]   Yeah, which is good. I like round
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.120]   I'm not crazy about the flat tire. This doesn't look like it has a flat. Yeah
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:40.520]   You know with Rick Osterlo now in charge of hardware at alphabet or echo is it a Google or at alphabet?
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.520]   It's Google, isn't it? I
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.760]   Think it is because yeah, I think cuz it's alphabet. I mean they still have nest and he's not in charge in nest
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.440]   So I think it must be Google
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.040]   And I think these are coming out of Google. I would expect to see some good stuff
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.800]   Of course he did the Moto 360. He was when he was at Motorola
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.560]   Let's take a quick break. We're talking about well anything we damn well want
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.920]   But you know what that's what I love doing with this panel because Jeff and Kevin are the greatest
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:12.080]   Our show today brought to you by rocket mortgage, which is if you are
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.040]   Not Google size if you're not making monopoly deals for your next house
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:23.600]   You maybe need a mortgage. Yeah, but remember the last time you got a mortgage. I remember it three years ago
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.080]   we
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.560]   It was all delayed it took forever. We had to give them so much paperwork and then more paperwork
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.640]   I think since the banking crisis it's gotten worse and
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.440]   Just piles tons of paper
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:42.420]   And then we had booked a cruise so Lisa and I leave on the cruise and her poor sister works as in her office here
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:47.360]   Had to do a lot of it and she couldn't just sign her name. She had to sign her name. I
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.320]   Feel so bad for
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.200]   it
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:57.040]   For you know in as in what I can't remember the phrase but in place of
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:04.760]   Lisa support it was crazy. It was crazy. Well now there's rocket mortgage from clicking loans and it's easy

[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:15.680]   Thank you for bringing us into the 21st century Kevin Marks is here
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.880]   from the indie web
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.040]   You know what you guys I feel like you're making progress
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:29.320]   I think we're making progress the idea of a free and open web that is not burdened by proprietary standards
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   I feel like you're making progress
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:39.080]   Microsoft for instance. I'll give you an example Microsoft announced that they're gonna do Skype for Linux or updating it
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   And it's gonna use web RTC
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.520]   There we go standard
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.400]   standard now
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:51.080]   I'm for you know what one of the reasons we use Skype is because they're proprietary codec silk. That's such a good job
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.480]   We could use web RTC. That's basically Google Hangouts
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   Silk
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.920]   Social media codec right silk is proprietary. It's their codec
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:07.720]   Yeah, but they're but the voice codec that's in web RTC is based on a lot of the bricks. Isn't it or something like that? Yeah, yeah
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:15.320]   I wasn't crazy with bricks. We know we've sampled them all. You know what? It's fine web RTC is perfect for what most
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:19.400]   people use these for which is conversations video and audio conversations
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:25.000]   Yeah, we have a somewhat more challenging standard because we're trying to get broadcast quality video out of it
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.960]   Oh, no, I have to quit everything else because I'm using the oldest low Mac now
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.960]   I think everything else and run
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:36.000]   Just Skype on this people people people come to us, you know and say I will just watch a Skype on CNN
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.320]   How do you your guys look so much better? How do you do that? And you know it's over years of
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:48.080]   Messing with it, but I worry because if they go all web RTC, you know, I'm torn because on the one hand web standards
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:52.960]   I like it open standards. Yeah, the other hand it doesn't work quite as well as the proprietary codec
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:59.600]   But it's I mean you can probably work on tuning that as well. Maybe we'll get better at it. Yes, maybe yeah, there's a few seen
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.040]   I'm gonna have to look up the name before I recommend it
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.000]   Is it any cast
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.480]   It's tricast that's it T. I y C a dot ST. No
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:18.320]   So this is this is an interesting tool. It's just a it's a tool for podcasters or audio podcasters
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:22.160]   So not go up quite confusing because of the tricaster. Yes
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.640]   Well, the thing's called cast but they got a clever URL, right?
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:31.320]   But what's neat about it is it uses Bob RTC in the browser
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:36.640]   But it records both sides locally and then puts them up loads them to their server
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:42.280]   Oh, that's very smart. So it lets you do the recall both ends thing without having to futz around on your own machine
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.240]   Which means you get clean audio from both sides
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:50.560]   And then they have an in-brows ready to you can use or you can just download the tracks and editing yourself in garage band or whatever you want to use
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:57.240]   So but the but it's it's a very neat application of using the web RTC thing and the and having used it a couple of times
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:03.760]   It works surprisingly well. You make a connection and you start telling people and you write. Oh, that's that's remarkably low latency
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:09.160]   And it works very well and at the end of it. You've got I said files from each speaker. So it's it's a what was that?
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.640]   TRY CA dot ST
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:20.960]   And it's like it's like there's a you can you can try it free for a month
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.600]   And then it's there's a ten bucks a month 30 bucks a month paying how much you use it
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   Oh
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.360]   And then I'll host your podcast for you as well if you if you're paying them
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.120]   But it's it's I've tried it out a couple times and if I was doing an audio podcast again
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.800]   That's what I'd be using because I was I was really impressed with how
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.520]   Straightforward it was competitive like the usual thing of I will record both ends
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.520]   If you're actually serious about audio quality you want to do that and that involves so much
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.720]   Encouraging people to set things up and fiddling around and specialized tools and stuff and this this just was like oh
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.680]   Click click click that just we try to once I think I try to double-end her at the very beginning of my career
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.440]   It was such a pain in the ass. I never did again Steve Gibson teased me
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.680]   Because he was he was going to he felt my pain he was gonna write and it's not so hard to do
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.200]   He was gonna write because the codecs or you know the bricks codec and stuff like that you just plug it in
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.840]   We had a very clever idea because part of the problem is you want the conversation in real time
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:25.120]   So he was gonna have a ring buff a local ring buffer that would would fill with local content while you did the conversation
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.760]   So filling in any dropped packets or out of order packets and getting a full quality
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.360]   And then when the recording was over it would just send in effect send the second the other end up
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   But you'd be in sync because you were doing it in real time and not worrying so much about what the real time sounded like
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.240]   I imagine they're doing something similar to that. They're effectively doing their recording locally
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:50.480]   But and we're at each end and then they're sinking it afterwards. Yeah, which is which is very smart. Yeah, basically
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.120]   buffer gets a local storage transmitting it as well, so it's you know, it's
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.820]   I'm impressed that the impressive part of the internet in the browser. I mean you used you used to be able to do this with
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:05.100]   I chat and garage band. I remember yeah. Yeah, I remember that
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.100]   It's a lotion at the same time and press record
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.760]   And it would record the conversation and that was very neat
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.960]   But it was hard to explain people what you had to do to do it. And this is cool. I'm gonna this is really cool
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.760]   But it's it's a neat thing is this so
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.840]   Boy if you're a pod cat it's so much easier. It kind of makes me mad
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.480]   So much easier down to it, but it's like everything else, right? Well, that's the point
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.480]   I put this amazing. No, but but um
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.080]   So you're going back to the indie web point web I to see one of the things that I I
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.840]   mentioned, but I think I
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.720]   Don't I mentioned this last time on the show or not was the decentralized web summit
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.920]   And the the which was an event organized at the internet archive
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.080]   It's best place almost a month ago. They're three of all weeks ago
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:55.200]   Trying to get a lot of the people working on these different bits and pieces of things that are making
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.320]   Making the web work in a more p2p way together and having a conversation together. Yeah, June the eighth
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.000]   I said it is more than a month ago
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.240]   And I wrote a piece I wrote a thing on it with Dan Gilmore. That's this I can link to in the
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:14.000]   Thing but oh, yeah, Corey doctor. Oh, the keynote. How nice is that? Oh, we had Tim Berners Lee. We have been surf
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.960]   Amazing event what? Yeah, it's it's if you got it
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.000]   It's not I'm going back and watch the videos. It was interesting stuff. But I always tell one thing's up. That's great. I
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.320]   Mean I mean there somewhere
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.120]   So I did I did a panel with the p2p guys
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.040]   There we go. That's mean little
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.200]   so
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.520]   But the but the interesting thing was a lot of them were doing some of this clevis
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.600]   stuff with the
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:47.400]   With a web RTC and some of these affordances that have been put in the browser to use them to do other other things to do edge-to-edge
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.920]   Communication without having to go through the client server model
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.640]   So that was that was that was definitely interesting. So there's well, there's me and waving. Yeah
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.840]   So
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:06.400]   So like being able to do using it to download videos through a bit too entirely in JavaScript
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.720]   and also as they play in the browser be
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.280]   Sharing packets upstream to other people who are watching the same stream
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:21.000]   Which of which is you can now now do without downloading any any plugins or anything which was fascinating
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.760]   So there's there's a chunk of bits and pieces ways of people repurposing these web technologies
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.400]   In lots of different ways and also the other big thing that I got from that was
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.160]   There are a lot of different people doing
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:39.820]   Content addressable storage where you look up things by a hash of the data rather than data itself
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:43.240]   and
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.520]   At the moment they will tend to have slightly different hashes and models
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.200]   So one of the things that struck me was that there's scope for us to convert some of these
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.480]   So you'll care where the object lives
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.360]   Yes, but because you'll have a kind of canonical URL that's deducible
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:05.040]   From the content itself, right? And also it means you can check you've got the right version once you get the once you get it nice
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.000]   So there's a bunch of bits and pieces, you know, is it decentralized storage?
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.400]   Is it kind of a peer-to-peer network or yes? There's there's several different ones. There's IPFS
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.120]   Zero net there's there's several like a great idea
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.800]   I've even built these out, but the challenge is always you have to be part of one of those systems to do it
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.080]   But if we can actually unify them through
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.640]   Converting the content hashes then that that's a powerful thing because suddenly you'll be able to say
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:34.500]   I need to get this thing. I could go to the original source for it or I could get it from this
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.960]   Local server that's you know, it local to me
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.400]   So I don't have to traverse the net for it
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   So if it's it could be on a local network
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.000]   It could be an offline thing that has a has a bunch of stuff on it and so on
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.760]   But you can check it the same thing because you can hash it
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.760]   So there's a bunch of really interesting bits around the edge of that that I got from that was fascinating
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.360]   And then there's you know plus there's the rest of the indie web stuff where we're already
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:59.640]   Excited about this but that but that but it was it was one of those places where it's like, okay
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.560]   I've been I'd be rolling my eyes a bit coin a bit for a few years
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:08.120]   And there are there was still a lot of you know some of that stuff going on
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:11.320]   but there's also a bunch of other applications of these kinds of
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:18.040]   cryptographic primitives some of the browser standards like like web RTC and
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:22.040]   Progressive web apps and lots of these other bits and pieces have been worked into the platform
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:28.360]   There suddenly gave me a lot of confidence that the web has sort of a lot of headroom for doing more new things
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.560]   Nice. I'm glad to see it
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:37.880]   So the so the the article I wrote with I think it's in the thing with a Dan Gilmore
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.320]   Ears where's that one gone?
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.400]   A fast company
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.920]   That that that's a sort of good starting point with some links
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.720]   But the article had a break open the web
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.360]   The site itself has that has that has the videos and suffering the event
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:02.200]   Um, and I think there'll be more versions of iterations of this in future because it was it was one of those events where you're like, oh
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.840]   Wow, there's a lot of people working on things
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.400]   it like you you know you mean a bunch of people who
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.640]   Are working on a bunch of different things and you start seeing patterns in them the same
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.400]   There's a lot of commonality here
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.560]   Um, and some of that is because you started from the same point
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.440]   But some of it is you start from different points are converging and that's when it gets interesting. I love this illustration
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.840]   I'm not sure if you're interested in this
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.840]   Are you rooting through
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.840]   Are you rooting up and down the tree
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.840]   Are you rooting side to side?
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:54.840]   Right
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   And in the internet
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   We are generally reading up and down the tree a lot of the time
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.840]   And the point
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.840]   So the point of the content hashing stuff is that it is independent of rooting
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   It doesn't matter how you get back
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   Right
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.840]   And we've had this bit torrent in effect
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.840]   It does this
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.840]   You pass around these days
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   You pass around a hash of the bit torrent structure
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   And you can basically see the torrents
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.840]   That is a list of servers
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.840]   And then you can bootstrap the whole process from that
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.840]   So
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.840]   Let me find the
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.840]   Go to web torrent.io
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.840]   Have a look at this
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.840]   Web torrent.io is that it?
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   Web torrent.io
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   Look at that on your computer
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.840]   Where it's?
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.840]   I shall.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.840]   Introducing web torrent desktop
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   So this is this JavaScript bit torrent client
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.840]   And you can just scroll up a bit
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.840]   There's a video at the top
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.840]   Oh, up
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.840]   Do you know that means different things
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   Depending on
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   Scroll up as
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840]   So that video that's playing there
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.840]   Yeah, that is being downloaded by BitTorrent
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   In very high speed I'm glad
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   High quality
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.840]   You can see the network technology on the left
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.840]   Wow
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:09.840]   And also you are
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.840]   This is super cool
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.840]   Uploading bits to other people as well
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.840]   Do you still have a seating
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.840]   Appear?
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.840]   Yeah, so somebody seats it
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   Somebody's seating it
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.840]   But other people
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.840]   But the point is you are actually
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.840]   Helping seat it by playing it
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.840]   And the other subtle thing
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.840]   For us is done with this
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.840]   Is because he's the controller
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.840]   Which loads the bits
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.840]   He's loading them in the order you want to play them in
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.840]   So he's using the
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.840]   BitTorrent
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.840]   Normally with the BitTorrent model
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.840]   You have the file broken up to the channel
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.840]   It's assembled kind of a random order
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.840]   And it's not usable until fully assembled
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.840]   Yeah, but with streaming you would love to
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.840]   Symbol it in order or at least close to orders
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.840]   It's all disappearing as the audience signs
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   On look, yeah, look at this
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   Oh, that's the the peering
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.840]   Oh my god, this is fascinating
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   And this is all done in the web
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   It's in during the browser, yeah
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.840]   Oh, yes, well, in the browser
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   All with JavaScript
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   It's incredible
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840]   This is pretty cool, yeah, so it's
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.840]   But basically he does this by gluing it
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   Gluing together things we already had
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   Which is the BitTorrent protocol
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.840]   JavaScript and the ability to
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.840]   Move video round
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.840]   But also he's using web RTC to do the edge-to-edge communication
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.840]   Because you can do that with RTC
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840]   So can I just use it now?
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.840]   I mean, how do I use this?
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.840]   There is a desktop client for
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.840]   OS X Windows and Linux
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840]   And this is
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840]   It's
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.840]   You basically you can embed any
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.840]   Turned into a web page
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.840]   It explains how to do it
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   Wow
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.840]   This changes the distribution equation for even the stuff we do
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   Right
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   So, matically
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.840]   You wouldn't do live streaming with this
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.840]   This is the live stream
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.840]   Because this is the sort of thing
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.840]   Somebody would have to see the entire file
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.840]   Yes, so you do this
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   You do this for your archive
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.840]   So the Internet archive
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   Already had a bit of the
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.840]   Mirror of the video they store
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   And they've hooked that up to this
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   So that you can just stream those
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.840]   In the browser now as well
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.840]   So where it would really be of interest
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840]   Right now Google has
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.840]   Really a monopoly
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   As close to monopolies you can get with YouTube
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.840]   And it's very, it's obviously centralized
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.840]   And only Google is big enough to kind of
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   Volume of traffic
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   But you could do a decentralized
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840]   YouTube using this
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.840]   Yes, yeah
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840]   I mean you still you still need someone to
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.840]   See it, but the point is that you could cope with
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.840]   With rampups as people
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.840]   Well, it would be great for us for instance
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.840]   Right now if you download a file
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840]   Of any of our shows
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.840]   If you're not watching live
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.840]   You're getting it from cash fly
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.840]   And they shoulder the burden of all the bandwidth
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.840]   Now they're a CDN so
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.840]   You get great download speeds and everything
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.840]   So from the end users point of view
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.840]   There'd be no difference or no advantage
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.840]   But from our point of view and cash
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.840]   Last point of view, there's a huge advantage
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.840]   Because the burden of bandwidth would be
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.840]   Shouldered by all the users as you know
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.840]   But then the challenge, the difficulty
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.840]   There is you are using
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.840]   Then you've when Jeff's on his
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.840]   Tether thing, it suddenly finds
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.840]   It's a lot of people as well
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840]   So there's a trade off there
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.840]   When we first started doing the shows
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.840]   And we were interviewed by a bit torrent
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.840]   And I liked that
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840]   Because the model was great
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.840]   We said to people, you know, if you get the show
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840]   And you want to be a CDR, please do
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   Will really help us distribute it
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   And people were great
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840]   And I loved that community feeling of everybody
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.840]   Was helping out and everybody was participating
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840]   And as a viewer, you were
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840]   But you're right now with
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840]   With bandwidths, caps and
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.840]   Metered bandwidths, it's really
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.840]   But the thing is
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840]   Somebody said in the chat
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.840]   Oh, your ISP will throttle you
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.840]   The ISP started to throttle it
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.840]   But that was partly because
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.840]   To some extent, BitTorrent was like
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.840]   An arbitrage around asymmetry
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   Because it would let you
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.840]   Like the cable networks were designed to download
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.840]   Faster than they uploaded
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.840]   But if you made multiple connections, you could end up uploading more as well
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   Right
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.840]   But the problem is the way
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.840]   It initially did it caused a lot of
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.840]   Contention and stream-drucking
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   It was open up for TCP streams
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.840]   So they invented
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.840]   The MUTP protocol
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.840]   Which actually is much more efficient
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.840]   Than that, and the amount of bandwidth
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.840]   Used dropped a lot because it doesn't
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.840]   Waste bandwidth and also it doesn't push the rest of the network out of the way
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.840]   It basically backs off in front of TCP streams
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.840]   So Kevin, being a Chromebook user
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.840]   Why can't this just operate on the web
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   Since the demo does, why do I need to desktop it all?
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840]   It can't go on the web
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.840]   You don't? Yeah
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.840]   That's the point
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:57.840]   So you...
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   No, but I could...
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   I could... I could... I don't have a client
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840]   You wouldn't see it from a Chromebook
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.840]   No, you don't need a client
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   I am, I'm sitting right now
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.840]   What I'm saying is
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.840]   I wanted to look at the poor, a torrent
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.840]   And do it
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.840]   Yes, I mean, basically you can embed a torrent in the page
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.840]   Tell you how to do it
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.840]   You can look up a torrent and then they can embed it in the page
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.840]   With JavaScript using this library
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   But I'm just saying they should bake this
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.840]   Basically a service
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.840]   Search on the torrent and play it through a web client
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.840]   I'm sure someone will
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.840]   I mean, at the moment, it's a technology thing
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.840]   I mean, they've done it for the Internet Archive
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.840]   Somebody could do that
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.840]   I think there's some constraints on which codecs it can use
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.840]   So you'd have to pick the right because it has to be a codec that's supported by the browser
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.840]   Whereas a lot of the torrents will have a variety of different codecs
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.840]   So it has to be in the subset that is part of the common browser codec things
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   So it's basically mp4
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   It looks like it caches it too
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.840]   So since I've downloaded it already
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   It comes from me
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.840]   I'm playing it and now others are joining to download it from me
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.840]   I think it uses local storage to cache it
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.840]   I haven't actually all done the whole stack
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.840]   Yeah, it does
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.840]   I just went forward a page and back and it's redown loaded it now
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   Yeah, okay, so that's the difference on a Chromebook, I guess
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.840]   Because here I am on a desktop, a Linux desktop
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840]   And it saved it
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.840]   So this is great, I love this idea
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:22.840]   I'd love to see a front end that is browser only, obviously
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.840]   And the more that BitTorrent is legitimized, the less that it'll be demonized
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.840]   I would have
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:34.840]   I can't buy now, don't people know that BitTorrent's used for so many legitimate purposes?
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.840]   It is still there
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.840]   I guess it's still the bulk of piracy as BitTorrent, right?
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840]   It is less blocked than it was
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.840]   I mean, the part of that was that they said this protocol changed
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.840]   They came up with it meant that it was actually causing network problems
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.840]   It doesn't do that anymore
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.840]   It backs out of the way of other streams
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.840]   It doesn't overload the pipes
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.840]   BitTorrent's going to cover the Republican convention next week
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.840]   With BitTorrent Live TV
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840]   They have a news network
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.840]   We're on BitTorrent Live TV, we're one of the first networks on it
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:06.840]   So you could watch us
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.840]   Watch it through there
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.840]   Yeah, you could watch us on Apple TV
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.840]   What's that?
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.840]   Now, Bram was at the
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.840]   Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.840]   He was there too
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.840]   I think he was talking to for us about this
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.840]   But I'm not sure they made the live thing work
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.840]   I think for Bram it really is all about legitimizing his baby
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.840]   I mean, he really doesn't like it
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   That it's seen as a piracy tool
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   No, I mean, he cares about the protocol and that it makes sense and it works
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   And it does
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   It is a really good protocol
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.840]   If you go right now to webTorrent.io
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.840]   You will see how quickly and easily it is down
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:39.840]   Yeah, it's amazing
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.840]   And it really is kind of remarkable
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.840]   And the beauty is because of the UI for this demo
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.840]   But showing you how you're helping others
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.840]   And seeing that down
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.840]   It's just kind of great
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840]   I really love seeing that
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.840]   And you know what that does?
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.840]   That eliminates the piracy claim
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.840]   Because you see every IP address
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.840]   It's seeing this, right?
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.840]   So, yeah, I guess somebody could use Tor
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.840]   And obfuscate their address
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.840]   But it's pretty hard on BitTorrent to be anonymous
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.840]   It actually turns out to be a really crappy way to pirate stuff
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:16.840]   Despite its success
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:21.840]   Well, it's the same way that Bitcoin is actually a bad way to buy legal things
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:22.840]   Right, right
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.840]   It's like, oh, wait, that wasn't that goal of this protocol at all
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.840]   What happened? Bitcoin halved
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.840]   Bitcoin halved
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.840]   Over the weekend
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840]   Over the weekend
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.840]   Wow
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.840]   That means it takes twice as much power to generate the same amount of Bitcoin if you're a miner
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.840]   Does it solve the ledger problem?
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.840]   The ledger was running out of room?
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.840]   No, it doesn't touch that
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.840]   And they still haven't, as a group, haven't solved that
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.840]   I mean, I presume the forks of Bitcoin are ongoing
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.840]   They're still ongoing
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.840]   They're still debating that back and forth
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   I've actually looked at the ratios of the different versions, yeah
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:05.840]   But price has stabilized, which, often to me, is a good indicator that things are getting better
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.840]   At least not getting worse
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.840]   That was my depressing headline of the week
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.840]   Bitcoin now less volatile than UK pound
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.840]   (Laughter)
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.840]   Oh my god, that's such bad news
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.840]   It's like, yup
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.840]   Oh, that's bad news
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.840]   Oh, jeez
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.840]   Obviously, it depends on the window you choose
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.840]   But yeah, basically, it's set up back in a few weeks
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840]   Oh my god
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:38.840]   So the thing that the halving does is it adjusts the balance between what you make by mining
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.840]   and what you make by fees
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.840]   Which does adjust the utility of the Bitcoin protocol to some extent
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.840]   And it's automatic, by the way, we should point out that no body does this
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.840]   The Bitcoin Foundation doesn't do it, it's part of the protocol
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.840]   It's automatic, which is so cool
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.840]   Well, it happens every, whatever it is, 5,000 days or something
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.840]   But the point is that, or is there some number of blocks, isn't it?
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.840]   But the block rate is approximately every 10 minutes
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.840]   It's, I mean, we don't know and we will never know
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.840]   I'm pretty convinced who Satoshi Nakamoto is or how many, whatever
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.840]   But pretty freaking brilliant
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.840]   This was so bad
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.840]   He missed a few things, but you know
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.840]   Well, there's this weirdness, it's like
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.840]   Things could change, you know, enough miners
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.840]   The miners could have ganged up and decided they didn't have to half
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.840]   And they'd have had to do a fork and do that
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.840]   But what it means is that this is predictable, they know it's going to happen
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.840]   They can plan for it
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.840]   There's no protection against forking no matter what you do
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.840]   Well, the protection against forking is
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.840]   One of you has to win, or you end up with be able to double spend
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:53.840]   Right
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.840]   And so, at the point where there's a fork going on
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.840]   There is some dissension about what counts as truth
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.840]   And you're picking a branch every time you send a transaction in
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:07.840]   But the sort of the point of the halving is because the number of bitcoins you get a block
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.840]   Went from 25, 12 and a half
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.840]   That means the fee income is more significant
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.840]   So when you're trying to put bitcoins on the transaction queue
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:20.840]   You're able to say, I will pay so much to the miner
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.840]   For this transaction being put into the block
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.840]   And they will obviously rank them by how much they make from it
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.840]   And put those ones in the earlier block on the later block
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.840]   Which means that that ratio is now more significant
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   Especially as the block size hasn't grown
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.840]   Which means the amount of fees you have to put in will creep up because of this
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:44.840]   As the scarcity of space in the block is the same
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.840]   So to some extent the miners now have an incentive not to grow the size of blocks
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:52.840]   Which is bad news because that's part of the problem
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.840]   It depends on what you think bitcoin is for
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.840]   It means that using bitcoin for very small transactions makes even less sense than it did before
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:06.840]   Because you would have to put more fee value into it
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:10.840]   And also because the block size is limited, you fill it out with small transactions
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   Then the potential fee value is lower
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:19.840]   So it's causing bitcoin to migrate towards large transactions in effect
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.840]   Samsung Galaxy Note 7 coming August 2nd we think
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:29.840]   We got the invitation yesterday to Samsung's event in New York City
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.840]   I'm going to forward it to you Jeff
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.840]   Please do, I'll try to go
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.840]   And I will not be in town, I'm going to San Diego that day
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.840]   To see a play
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.840]   Aren't you just Mr. Culture?
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.840]   Or what is it? Is it a dramatization of Taco Bell commercial?
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:49.840]   It's Steve Martin's new comedy
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.840]   Oh my!
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.840]   And Jenna Fisher is in it from Office
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840]   Oh, lover
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.840]   I know, you know what, it's a great premise
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.840]   I don't think it's a musical
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.840]   It's called Meteor Shower
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.840]   The premise is two couples go to their backyard
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.840]   One of the couples backyard to watch a meteor shower
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   It's like a drawing room comedy in the backyard
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   At least that's my understanding
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.840]   It's a great cast, just four people
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.840]   I'm going to see it
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.840]   Anyway, that's why I will not be here
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840]   But we will have coverage
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.840]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, it's like a Rabbi a priest
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840]   And an elder walking to a bar and you stop there
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.840]   So four people go, I don't know what else happens
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.840]   I haven't shown you what
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.840]   Well, dialogue ensues
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.840]   It seems so obvious, we will
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.840]   It would be great if you're watching a meteor shower
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.840]   Of course, I'm playing a movie
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.840]   You heard of a play called Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.840]   It's Steve Martin, it's all I need to know
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   Steve Martin writing it
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.840]   Think of it as a comedic "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.840]   It should be fun
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:53.840]   Anyway, Samsung skipped the Note 6
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.840]   Because, of course, they have the Galaxy S7
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.840]   They want everything to be in sync
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   We don't know anything about the S7
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   Except that it will be in the Note 7
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.840]   I should say
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.840]   A successor to one of the most successful phones
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.840]   Despite all odds of all time
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.840]   This Galaxy Note was the giant phone
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.840]   It was the first 5-inch-plus phone
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.840]   Every one of them, every one of them
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.840]   When I put my note to my head and they said
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.840]   What the hell is that?
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:23.840]   You're gonna say
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.840]   Can't a giant Hershey bar?
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.840]   What is that?
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.840]   Now
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.840]   I never understood that criticism
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.840]   I know
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.840]   The distance between my ear and my mouth is more than the favorite
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.840]   It fits
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:35.840]   It fits, right?
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.840]   Yeah
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   You know, the classic handset is bigger than even the other person
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840]   Well, everybody realized that
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.840]   The big screen, we want a big screen
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.840]   And the stylist, I think, not everybody
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.840]   Definitely for some markets
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:48.840]   Is awesome!
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.840]   Take notes, you can draw pictures
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.840]   Apparently, they're gonna do the edge style
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   Which has been so successful for them
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840]   I've mixed feelings
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.840]   Aesthetically, the edge is incredible
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.840]   It's beautiful, it's like an infinity pool
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.840]   But it's a little hard to hold
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.840]   And sometimes you get stray inputs from your fingers
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.840]   The rumor, of course, 5.7 inch screen
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.840]   Edge style
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.840]   Same 12 megapixel cameras, the Galaxy S7
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.840]   Water resistant, again, they're back to that
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:23.840]   Perhaps a massive 4,000 milliamp hour battery
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.840]   Which, you know, you never know if that's gonna be enough
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.840]   Given the size of the screen and the number of pixels
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:30.840]   It'll be pushing
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.840]   The other rumor that I find interesting is
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.840]   An iris scanner
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.840]   I don't know if that's a good idea
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.840]   So the FBI can get it from you
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:40.840]   Yeah, that's good, yeah
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.840]   Yeah, you know, do you really want to unlock your phone
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.840]   Like, by holding it to your eyeball?
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.840]   And, you know, I think windows phones use this
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.840]   And it's very annoying, they say up, down
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.840]   No, a little closer, no, a little far, okay
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:55.840]   Don't move
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.840]   No, wait, the paper's lip will clear how to do it
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.840]   Yeah, no, that's not, you don't want that
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.840]   So, and by the way, fingerprint works so well
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.840]   I don't see a reason for it
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   It looks, you know, we don't know
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   We'll find out, and we'll be covering it
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.840]   August 2nd, that's just around the corner
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.840]   A couple of weeks from now
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.840]   Galaxy Note 7 unpacked
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.840]   7 unpacked 2016
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   August 2nd, our live coverage
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.840]   8am Pacific 11am eastern
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.840]   Put that in your calendar
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.840]   And I'll make sure you get an invite
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:33.840]   Because we'd love to hear from you, what you think of it and all that
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.840]   If they'll fly me, they'll always take an invite
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.840]   I don't think airfare was included
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.840]   Well, didn't, I think Jeff and I
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.840]   Both got an invitation to Huawei's big event in Shanghai
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.840]   Yep, yep, yep
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.840]   Oh, sounds like fun
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.840]   It's made me do that
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.840]   Well, you know, I've been looking at Jeff and it looks more
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.840]   You know, at first we thought, well, what is it, a junk kit for Huawei
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   But now it looks more like Dreamforce, you know, Salesforce
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.840]   Yeah, it is
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.840]   It's done really well with a conference around the Salesforce technology
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:10.840]   It's huge, and I think Huawei's attempting to do the same thing
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   And they told us we're trying to get people outside of Huawei
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   Somebody's playing Pokemon Go
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.840]   When I sometimes ask me how many I've put Pokemon's up
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.840]   Your son will peer pressure you into that
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.840]   You know, now that you've done it, everybody else has to launch their Pokemon Go
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.840]   Just to see if anything is shown
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.840]   You were trying to get somebody from outside, what?
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.840]   Huh?
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.840]   They're trying to get, they have Intel CEO
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.840]   Greg, I can't ever pronounce his name-ich
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.840]   We'll be there, and I think they're trying to get others from other companies
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.840]   So to make it more of a conference
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840]   So
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.840]   Can you stop that?
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840]   Or at least turn the sound down
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.840]   So I don't know you're playing because it's making me a little antsy
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840]   Let me find the sound setting
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.840]   There we go
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.840]   No, I don't know, he's not going to stop playing
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.840]   He's just turning the sound
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.840]   Oh yeah, that's fine, I can understand why you would never stop
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.840]   Apparently you'll be able to share Google Play apps, movies and music
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.840]   This is nice
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.840]   Soon from Google Play with up to six people
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.840]   I spend a fortune buying shows on Google Play
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.840]   So this is the Google Play Family Library Plan
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.840]   Now there is already a family subscription for music
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:24.840]   So is this just extending that to TV apps
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.840]   And music?
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.840]   You would have paid more or?
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.840]   Well, I think so
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.840]   You certainly do for the music family plan
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.840]   Which is $15 for five
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   That's an 11
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   Yeah, $15 for five people
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.840]   This is the case where I've already bought the show
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.840]   Can I share it with up to six people?
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.840]   According to CNET
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.840]   The primary account holder will be able to remove specific titles from the family library
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   Or hide certain artists who want others to know you enjoy
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.840]   Well, we don't know, I guess
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.840]   This is not yet out
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.840]   Everyone in the group will be able to access every single app, video and book
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.840]   That's available to the account holder
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.840]   So as dad, you're the account holder
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840]   I am indeed
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.840]   You can hide
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   You used to be the breadwinner now
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840]   Yeah, the account holder
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.840]   You don't have to pay extra to sign up for the Google Play Family Library
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.840]   But you will have to have a credit card saved to the account for future purchases
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.840]   But you already probably do
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:26.840]   That's there
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.840]   I do things like Mr. Robot
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.840]   I'll just go ahead and buy it on play
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.840]   So I can watch it when I want to
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840]   And not have to
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.840]   Because the problem is I want to watch it on a train or a plane
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.840]   I'm not online
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.840]   Right
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.840]   So I'll buy it
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.840]   Yeah, I do
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:40.840]   No, I don't think that's stupid
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:41.840]   That's good
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   Let's support shows and show people
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.840]   There's a business
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.840]   And not just putting it on cable
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.840]   I think that's really important
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.840]   Anyway
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.840]   I certainly use the Family Praying for Google Music
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:55.840]   That's great
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.840]   Yeah, I pay for it
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.840]   And I suppose I'd please do that with Amazon
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.840]   We've got kindlers that are on the same account
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.840]   And we can read each other's books
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.840]   We have a sponsored texture that's like Netflix for magazines
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.840]   And they encourage you to
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:11.840]   They said you're going to have five devices
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.840]   You can share it with your family
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.840]   They actually encourage it
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.840]   But wasn't there a legal decision this week?
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:18.840]   Yes
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.840]   Maybe
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:20.840]   Maybe
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.840]   It potentially makes it a felony
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.840]   To share your password
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.840]   I don't
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.840]   You know, we talked about this yesterday
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.840]   With Steve on Security Now
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:36.840]   And it really was
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:43.840]   So Snopes says it hasn't become a felony
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:46.840]   It was a court decision
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.840]   Most people, like the LA Times are saying relax
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.840]   You're not going to jail
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.840]   For sharing your Netflix password
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840]   It was a
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.840]   A pellet court ruling
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.840]   So this guy David Nassau
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.840]   Worked as a regional director at an executive
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.840]   Search firm, Corn Ferry
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:07.840]   Left the firm started his own competing business
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.840]   He had someone else use the login information
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.840]   Of his former assistant
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.840]   Who was still at Corn Ferry
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.840]   To download
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840]   Proprietary information from the company's database
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.840]   Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.840]   Say that David
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.840]   Did knowingly steal trade secrets by
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.840]   Accessing a protected computer
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:27.840]   Without authorization
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.840]   That's a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.840]   And the Economic Espionage Act
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.840]   Some have projected that
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.840]   Oh, that means you can now
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:39.840]   Prosecute password sharing
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.840]   As a Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violation
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.840]   I don't think so
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:44.840]   So that's a
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.840]   That's a different kind of intent
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.840]   I think that's really stretching it
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.840]   Maybe somebody will try it
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.840]   But you know it's always up to the court
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.840]   To decide whether that's the case
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:53.840]   And I don't think any court would reason
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:56.840]   But also if Amazon did that
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.840]   For Kindle users
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.840]   Then they just use a lot of Kindle users
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.840]   Nobody's going to prosecute that
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.840]   They already know that we're reading the same books
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   On multiple devices over different times
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.840]   And they're clearly happy with it
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.840]   As we're buying books that way
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.840]   So don't worry
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.840]   Go ahead
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:17.840]   Here's a story that I think is kind of interesting
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.840]   PewDiePie, among other YouTubers
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.840]   Was paid thousands of dollars
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.840]   To promote a game by Warner Brothers
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.840]   He put...
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.840]   Now this is... I'm very curious what you say
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.840]   This is an FTC judgment
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.840]   FTC says that
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.840]   Warner Brothers failed
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:35.840]   To adequately disclose
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:37.840]   It paid online influencers
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:38.840]   To post gameplay
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:41.840]   Videos of Middle Earth, Shadow of Mordor
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:45.840]   PewDiePie, one of those streamers
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.840]   Now apparently PewDiePie
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840]   Said
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.840]   Sponsored by Warner Brothers
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.840]   Not in the video
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.840]   But in the YouTube
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.840]   Description of the video
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.840]   Now
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.840]   No, but I don't think any of the FTC's gone
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:00.840]   After PewDiePie
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:01.840]   Although they do have strict rules
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.840]   And we are...
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.840]   Our attorney said
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.840]   Hey guys
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.840]   If you mention a sponsor
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.840]   On a tweet or an Instagram
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.840]   Even if you're responding
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:12.840]   Somebody says to us
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.840]   That's why we got those emails now
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:15.840]   Yep
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.840]   Somebody says to us
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840]   Hey we really love that Casper mattress
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.840]   And I retweet it
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.840]   I have to add #sponsor
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.840]   Or text that indicates
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.840]   Clearly that they are a sponsor
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.840]   I can't just retweet that
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.840]   That's a violation of FTC rules
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:31.840]   I say that on a show
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.840]   I'm going to identify
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:35.840]   If I, as a recipient of your
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.840]   Great generosity
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.840]   Say it in my own tweet
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:39.840]   We would like to be
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.840]   Pated directly
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.840]   We would like you to say
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.840]   By the way, full disclosure
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.840]   Yeah, or you see
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:48.840]   Our attorney said
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:51.840]   Saying #add #sponsors
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.840]   Okay, I prefer to put it in the
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.840]   Pros
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.840]   My sponsor, our sponsor
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:57.840]   Our Casp
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:58.840]   Or something like that
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.840]   The thing about this is
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.840]   I'm fine with that
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   That's full disclosure
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:03.840]   That's appropriate
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.840]   I am too
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.840]   This is the new payola
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.840]   Right
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.840]   Customers, FTC says
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.840]   It's gone on
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:11.840]   So now I don't know how this
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.840]   Right, FTC says
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:13.840]   Customers have the right to know
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.840]   For viewers who are providing
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.840]   Their own opinions or paid
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.840]   Sales pitches
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:17.840]   Copped companies like Warner
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:18.840]   Brothers need to be straight
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:19.840]   With consumers
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:20.840]   And their online ad campaign
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:21.840]   It's interesting though
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:22.840]   That they went after Warner
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:23.840]   Brothers
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.840]   And to my knowledge
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.840]   They have not yet gone after
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   The YouTube creators
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.840]   PewDiePie's video
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.840]   Had 3.7 million views
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.840]   What a shot
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.840]   I think PewDiePie needs to do
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.840]   More than just put it in the
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.840]   Description, to be my opinion
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:40.840]   Because people don't always see
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.840]   The description
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.840]   Plus, remember, YouTube videos
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.840]   Can be embedded anywhere
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.840]   Exactly
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:45.840]   And you won't see the description
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:47.840]   It needs to be in the video
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.840]   At the beginning
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:50.840]   Well, you put a super on when
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:51.840]   You're doing an ad read, don't you?
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:52.840]   Oh, we're clear, yeah, I think
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:53.840]   There's never been any question
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.840]   That it's an ad
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:55.840]   But it's not an ad
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.840]   I don't want to trick our audience
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.840]   I have no interest in tricking
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.840]   Anybody
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.840]   The ethical podcast and things
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.840]   They'll put some different
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:07.840]   Background music on, they'll put
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.840]   If it's audio only, they'll put
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.840]   A caption on the screen
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:11.840]   I usually say we're going to have
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.840]   We'll be more conversation
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.840]   But first, let's talk about our
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840]   Sponsor
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.840]   At the end, I'll say we thank
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840]   Them for their support
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.840]   I try to really make it clear
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.840]   There's a different lower third
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.840]   I do everything but both of them
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.840]   I do everything but blare a horn
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.840]   And say advertisement, advertisement
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.840]   Yeah
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:29.840]   The voice even changes
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.840]   And my voice changes
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.840]   That's unconscious, by the way
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.840]   I've turned into Leo the pitchman
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.840]   So, no, but look at
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.840]   It's not even that this is against the law
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.840]   It's that nobody in there
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.840]   Should try to trick your community
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:50.840]   Well, it's community
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:51.840]   Right, but the whole issue
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.840]   With data advertising
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.840]   Product placement
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.840]   And that's where the internet is
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840]   Vartent
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.840]   To learn that my favorite
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.840]   Publication, the Atlantic, makes
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.840]   The bulk of its money
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.840]   With native content
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.840]   Now fortunately with the Atlantic
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.840]   It's clearly native content, right?
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.840]   Yeah, and if you, at the courts
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.840]   I think did a superb job
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.840]   And they make their money the same
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.840]   Way, a publication of the Atlantic
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:18.840]   And interestingly, I had a conversation
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.840]   With Justin Smith, who was the
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.840]   Founder, of course, when he was the head of Atlantic
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.840]   And Zach Seward, who was there
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.840]   When I was at a conference in Africa last year
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:28.840]   And the conversation, they said, "Oh, remember?
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.840]   I don't know who it was at the courts."
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   But somebody didn't like advertising
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.840]   And so he said, "This is how we're going to do it."
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:34.840]   "This is how we're going to do it."
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:36.840]   So, an editorial person
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.840]   Kind of set the standards for what advertising should be
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.840]   And then they're going to care about the user
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   They're going to make sure to be straight with the user
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.840]   That's the issue
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.840]   That's all
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.840]   Your audience deserves that
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:48.840]   My audience deserves that
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.840]   If I'm doing it wrong, I want to be
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.840]   Please tell me, I want to make sure everybody understands
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.840]   It's funny because there's different cultural standards
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.840]   People in the United States are used to ads
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.840]   Interstitial ads in the stream now stuff
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.840]   There's a long tradition in older broadcast media
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.840]   Of people like Arthur Godfrey
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.840]   Stopping the show and saying, "Now I want to tell you a little bit
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:11.840]   Or Paul Harvey and the Bose acoustic wave radio and all of that
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:14.840]   But in the UK and elsewhere, we've got a lot of UK viewers
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.840]   Say, "What is going on with the adverts?"
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.840]   They were shocked that a host was doing ads
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.840]   I guess it's not done in the UK, I don't know
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.840]   No, well, there were a ton of rules there
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:29.840]   At the BBC, they were actually covering up products
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.840]   We used to do that too
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.840]   In fact, I think we somewhat do
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.840]   You can't tell what Model TBM using here
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:39.840]   But you do know the kind of new got
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:42.840]   You know that I'm using fine Ferrera
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.840]   Quality nuked
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.840]   The nougat of champions
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.840]   My God, somebody's eaten all our Ferrera
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.840]   Notice, there's plenty of big hunk left
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.840]   But the Ferrera, it's a scarce commodity
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.840]   That's because Ferrera, Tarone has been made in Italy
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:02.840]   With love since 1829
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.840]   1892
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.840]   I'm sure I'm getting money for that
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.840]   Maybe they'll send me some nougat anyway
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.840]   We gave so much free advertising to Chipotle
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.840]   I never got a penny
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.840]   And then, of course, after the E. coli scale, we haven't mentioned Chipotle since
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.840]   Didn't get so much as a free burrito from the steam
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.840]   Even a burrito
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.840]   We made a joke of it on one of our shows that daily gives was
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.840]   Because we were never able to get ads
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.840]   So we started doing our own ads for tostinos pizza rolls
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.840]   And then we found out that with totinos
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.840]   We were so excited
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.840]   And then we found out that with totinos
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.840]   We were saying it wrong
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.840]   For a long time
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.840]   Needless to say, we never got any money from them either
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:47.840]   Facebook, Twitter and breaking news
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.840]   This is a BuzzFeed report from Charlie Warzle
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.840]   And of course, he's talking about the fact that a lot of these
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:58.840]   You know, the live video of the shootings last week
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.840]   Going right through Facebook, Jeff was on
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.840]   We had a fantastic Twitter Sunday, Jeff. Thank you
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.840]   Thank you
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.840]   Thank you, Steven, Vijayanathan
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.840]   Oh, Doctor Jason Heiner
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.840]   If you didn't watch that discussion
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.840]   Of how the new media is changing the conversation in this country
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.840]   Really a very good to it
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.840]   And really thank you
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.840]   The session I had was off the record
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.840]   So I won't talk about it in detail
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.840]   But Facebook brought in one of its policy executives
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.840]   And it was on a tour talking to journalists in New York
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.840]   About these kinds of things
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.840]   And it was great because, you know, it was an open discussion
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.840]   And these are really naughty issues
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.840]   Of what you're going to do about live
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:42.840]   And I think Facebook's attitude has shown by the fact that what they did
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.840]   And they, you know, I'm told that it was not
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.840]   They did not take down that video on purpose or to provide breathing room
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.840]   But they're trying to leave things up
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.840]   They're trying to leave things out there
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.840]   And Twitter is probably very much in the same vein, right?
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.840]   They're going to have this
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.840]   They haven't yet, but Periscope
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.840]   Which is a Twitter property
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.840]   And it lets you stream right to the Twitter feed
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.840]   YouTube is putting up as everybody in the world's going to have one
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.840]   Everybody?
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840]   Yeah
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.840]   I don't think that's a bad thing
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:14.840]   I think it's a good set
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:15.840]   I agree
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.840]   You know what I said
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.840]   Also what I said to Facebook
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.840]   Is that I think that what they can do
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.840]   They'll recognize in their data when
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.840]   Tons of traffic is going to something
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.840]   What I suspect happened with the Reynolds video
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.840]   Was there was tons of traffic going to something
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.840]   And something shuts off and says, "Oh, watch out, it could be porn"
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.840]   Yeah, no, I'm sure that's the case
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.840]   It was definitely an automated thing that triggered a human review
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:38.840]   Has to be
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.840]   And then the human review went through and then they said, "Okay, put it back up"
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:42.840]   Yeah
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.840]   But number one, Facebook and YouTube at all
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.840]   Will recognize when there's an unusual occurrence of traffic to a video
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.840]   And then number two, when something is happening in a, you know, in Times Square
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.840]   They'll also recognize geographically
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.840]   "Oh, here's 10 feeds from the same place showing the same stuff must be true"
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.840]   So between discovery and verification
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.840]   The platforms will have data that we can't possibly have
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:14.840]   So you have these new platforms like Storyful that do a wonderful job of verifying video
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.840]   But the platforms will know that base data
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.840]   That'll make it possible to find this stuff
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.840]   Of course, Twitter trying to become a legitimate news outlet
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.840]   They just made a deal to stream the Republican National Convention
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.840]   You know, I think I'm not going to watch on NBC ABC CBS
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.840]   I'm going to watch on Twitter
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.840]   I think I'll watch on Twitter
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.840]   Will it be in moments? How is this going to work?
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:38.840]   I don't know
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.840]   You know what, I can see
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:42.840]   What do you mean we have in Paris, yeah?
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:48.840]   Yeah, I've watched news break in moments
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.840]   I mean, that's the theory that you would do that
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.840]   That you would see
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.840]   Certainly, if somebody dies
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.840]   First place I see it
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.840]   First place I saw that David Bowie had passed
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.840]   Was on Twitter
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.840]   The first place I saw
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:09.840]   You know, well, I don't want to go through the list
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.840]   But many people have passed
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.840]   That's where you see it is Twitter
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:17.840]   And I don't think there's a reason that breaking news couldn't happen on Twitter
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840]   No, I guess I guess
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.840]   And it would be smart of them to then have
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.840]   On moments, and there is this capability
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.840]   I don't know if anybody uses it to follow momentarily
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.840]   Breaking news, right?
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:31.840]   Yeah, but the challenge, I mean, the challenge is
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.840]   With the convention is that mostly isn't news
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:34.840]   Here's some story
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:35.840]   There's some story
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.840]   Neil Farage is going to be speaking at the GOP convention
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.840]   No
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:40.840]   What?
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:41.840]   Nigel Farage?
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.840]   No
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.840]   Nigel, not Neil
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.840]   Nigel Farage is going to Cleveland
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:46.840]   Is he speaking now?
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.840]   Jesus
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840]   Is he speaking?
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.840]   I don't know, he's attending
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.840]   I can't imagine if he's there that they won't bring him up on stage
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:53.840]   What are you going to put?
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.840]   Just have him in the mass of people?
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:58.840]   What the what?
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.840]   I mean, that was a bad
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.840]   Solidarity
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.840]   Yes, Marie Le Pen
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.840]   Yeah, let's get Marie Le Penhouse
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.840]   Why not? Let's just have a trip
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:12.840]   You know, what's Kim Jong-un doing these days?
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.840]   Is he a man?
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.840]   He's a man
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.840]   I know everybody, they're great, great people
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.840]   They're leaders, they're smart people
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.840]   And I have a great relationship with all of them
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:28.840]   I think I am going to watch it on a GOP
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.840]   I'm telling you, of course you're going to watch it
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.840]   For the fail well
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.840]   Twitter will be an interesting place to watch
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:37.840]   Because, you know what, Facebook tried to do this
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:38.840]   Whatever happened to that
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.840]   Remember they had streams and you would watch
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:43.840]   And there'd be all the social content going on around it
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.840]   They still do that, I don't think so
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.840]   They're going to be in Facebook, it's going to be both of them
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.840]   They still do that?
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:49.840]   That makes sense
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.840]   I mean, you know, it's kind of the model we have
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.840]   We have the thing live, we have the chat room going on
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.840]   And Facebook has a bit of that, but it's less coherent
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.840]   Because it's Facebook and so it's in their sort of weird, frayed thing
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.840]   And so your comments you see don't make a lot of sense
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.840]   By the way, there is a natural fit for that kind of light
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.840]   Last night there was another shooting on Facebook Live
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.840]   So it's not over by any means
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.840]   This from Norfolk, Virginia, three men badly wounded
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.840]   And one of them was streaming live video
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:24.840]   You can hear 30 gunshots over 20 seconds
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:29.840]   This is just, as the New York Times said
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.840]   Another night, another shooting on Facebook Live
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.840]   This is the new normal
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.840]   This is the, you know, the British news
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:44.840]   This was actually in the piece that I linked from the editor of The Guardian
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.840]   Which I can't remember
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.840]   Yeah, I'm sorry
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.840]   How technology swept the truth
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:53.840]   Yeah, tell me what that means, I don't know
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.840]   Well, so it's a long piece, it's very thoughtful
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.840]   And she's saying it's about the end of gatekeeping by media
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.840]   But how does that mean to disrupt the truth?
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:09.840]   Well, because her contention is that before media was fact checked
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:12.840]   And now people can go and pick their own channel
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:16.840]   And cluster with a bunch of people who believe the things that aren't necessarily true
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.840]   And their sensation and so on
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.840]   But to be fair to her, she then partway through talks about
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.840]   The Sun newspaper in the UK
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:30.840]   And the recent
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.840]   They finally settled the Hillsborough thing
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:36.840]   Recently, you know about this, Jeff, right?
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:37.840]   So this was
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.840]   It's a long time, it's 15 years ago, it was a long time, very long time ago
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:48.840]   There was a horrible stampede inside a football stadium in the UK
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.840]   And lots of people got crushed to death
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.840]   Because they put up wire mesh netting between the crowd and the pitch
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:56.840]   I remember the rush against them, they died
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.840]   And the Sun runs some hideous story about it
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.840]   Saying that people defiled the corpses and all kinds of stuff like this
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.840]   Based on nothing much, particularly, based on rumours from the police and so on
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:15.840]   And then didn't respond to this and the lie held up for a long time
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.840]   And finally they backed down from it after years later
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:24.840]   So that is an example of the gatekeepers getting it wrong
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:26.840]   And not being as challenged from it
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.840]   And she rightly says, had something like that happen now
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.840]   With 53,000 people present with phones in their pocket
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.840]   We'd have seen the video of what was going on
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:37.840]   The narrative, the false narrative
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.840]   Which was the truth
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.840]   Which was the truth
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:45.840]   And you know, I suppose the American equivalent would be
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.840]   The alleged deaths in the arena after Katrina
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:53.840]   And the myth that was created there of people around Beijing
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:56.840]   In that place where actually that didn't happen
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.840]   There were these narratives that sort of take hold
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.840]   And become part of the discourse
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.840]   And then when you go back and examine them, haven't happened
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:08.840]   And I think this stuff gets resolved more quickly these days
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.840]   Because more people on site with cameras
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:16.840]   And spreading stuff through social media
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.840]   But at the same time, the other half of this is
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.840]   It is much easier to put together a channel full of people
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.840]   Who will agree with each other and believe that there is conspiracy theory
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.840]   So when the head of the European Commission says he's been talking to aliens
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:34.840]   All the clusters of people who believe that the earth is
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.840]   The leaders of the earth are in communion with aliens
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.840]   Put those things up on their site and say, look, finally there is proof
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.840]   See, proof
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:44.840]   And this fits in with the other ancient aliens evidence we have over here
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:45.840]   And the narrative continues
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.840]   And so, you know
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.840]   In a sense, we have this dueling truth out there
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:56.840]   We're always going to have this
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.840]   And there's sort of myth that there was only the news
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.840]   The golden age of news, everything was fact-shaped and true
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:06.840]   Actually, there was just a smaller set of people controlling the narrative
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:10.840]   This is exactly what we talked about on Sunday, right, Jeff?
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.840]   That's exactly the question
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.840]   And Jeff's always been really good on this
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:17.840]   It's not... it wasn't better than it was
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:22.840]   It's a myth that these people who controlled the news had the monopoly on truth
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.840]   By any means, you know
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:29.840]   And let's be clear that the trust in American news media started falling in the 70s
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.840]   Right, long before the net
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.840]   Right, and rightly, and to be honest, I think we know, rightly so
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:40.840]   But aren't we now in a better position? Yes, if you're a conspiracy theorist
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.840]   You can find many more sources to confirm your belief
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.840]   But that confirmation bias has always been a problem in general
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:53.840]   But for everybody else, there are many, many choices of sources
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.840]   And you get to sift them all and come to the past conclusion
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:00.840]   The problem is that we have business models built on volume over value
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:01.840]   Well, I agree with that
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.840]   And so I think part of what Kath is saying in full disclosure is I work with the Guardian
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.840]   The Guardian has started a membership program which is really a contribution program
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:14.840]   Which is her saying support quality journalism, support value
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:20.840]   And we don't want to put a wall up, so can you please join and support us that way?
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:24.840]   And I think that we have to find various models that are going to support value
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:27.840]   And not just crappy stories about two colored dresses
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:33.840]   Yeah, and well, you know, in my opinion
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:39.840]   If you are... this is where I have high hopes for new media and podcasting
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:43.840]   In particular, if you are more interested in serving your audience
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.840]   Than a tricking your audience with Linkbait
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.840]   And you focus on serving your audience
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:50.840]   All will be well
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.840]   And I do think that that's the strong message that podcasters understand
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:59.840]   You know, a few people... when you get into this stuff
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:03.840]   And certainly if you're working for a big company and there's pressure to deliver views
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:06.840]   You may fall sway to that
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:09.840]   But I think any company that's really smart about media says
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.840]   We need to serve our audience
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.840]   We need to give them the information they need
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.840]   We need to serve them with the best as best we can
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.840]   And not trick them into clicking our headlines by writing
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.840]   Yeah Leo, and I think and contribute to what you do
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.840]   And I'm learning right now how difficult this is
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:28.840]   Because as you know, we've kind of pulled back a little bit on Dot NYC
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.840]   Because I haven't figured out what it ought to be yet
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:35.840]   And in the essence of this is, I don't know what the right relationship is with that audience
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840]   To know how to serve them
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:40.840]   And so trying to find that right voice and that right expectation
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.840]   Is really hard
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:46.840]   And I've always respected what you do, but I see all the more how hard it is
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.840]   To come up with that formula
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.840]   It's easier for us because we have a niche, right?
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:53.840]   We're serving geeks, we're serving people like me
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.840]   So I know how to serve people like me, because it's people like me
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.840]   And I've never attempted to go beyond that
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.840]   And every time we have, or I've worked for companies that have
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.840]   I have been at sea, because I don't know what those people want
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.840]   I know what my people want
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.840]   And I'm very interested in serving that community
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.840]   That's my community tech enthusiast community
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.840]   What was the, what was the, what was the McDonald's
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:18.840]   Hula burger, what was the, right?
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:22.840]   What was the Hula burger of Twit?
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.840]   The Hula burger, well we did quite a few, we did a junk food show
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:29.840]   Called Munchcast, which I liked a lot
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.840]   But it wasn't really right up our alley
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.840]   The minute the number shows like that
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:36.840]   Where we were, where we made the biggest category
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:38.840]   We made a mistake in his geek culture
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.840]   And I think a lot of people make that mistake
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.840]   Conflating a technology enthusiast and geek culture
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.840]   The cons, the comic cons and stuff like that
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.840]   We drifted a little bit in the geek culture of vain
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:55.840]   And I put the end to that, because that's fine
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.840]   And do that, anybody wants to do that
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:50:59.840]   That's not what we do
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:02.840]   We're about geek tech enthusiasts
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:05.840]   And yes, there is, you know, there's some
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.840]   Overlap with comic book culture, comic con culture, a geek culture
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.840]   But that overlap does not justify us
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.840]   Deviating from what we know about
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.840]   Which is how to serve the technology audience, period
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:20.840]   And, you know, it's funny because we had a staff meeting yesterday
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.840]   And we were talking about marketing messages
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:24.840]   And I said, it's very tempting with marketing messages
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.840]   You know, the little blurbs for each show
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:28.840]   To put something that's going to generate traffic
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.840]   And I would ask you not to do that
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.840]   But to put the information that will serve our audience
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:36.840]   Tell them what they're going to expect from the show and the information in the show
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:38.840]   And how the show's going to benefit them
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:42.840]   That's how I want you to generate traffic, not by putting a catchy headline
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:43.840]   Amen, amen, man
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:46.840]   Like, oh, I don't know
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:49.840]   There is only one flavor of herring
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:52.840]   That's going to be the title, by the way
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:57.840]   But that came about, that really was never an attempt for link bait or SEO
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.840]   That was just jokey, right?
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.840]   And it was kind of a game I would play with the audience
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.840]   We kind of, you know, this is lost in the midst of time now
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.840]   But I always used to have bloopers at the end of the show
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:11.840]   Not bloopers, but like the con, I would have long conversations
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:14.840]   The tradition of that, long conversations before the show starts
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.840]   As we were always looking for a little chunk we could then stick at the end of the show
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840]   And the title usually came from that
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:23.840]   And the idea was to get people to listen to the whole show and go to the end
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.840]   That I don't think is too bad
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.840]   Let me ask you another question, yes
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:29.840]   It's not tricking anybody
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:33.840]   So, whatever you get a new employee, whatever you want to start to understand with
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.840]   I will just bet that oftentimes you hear the same idea
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:41.840]   You want to blank, and you know better, what is that?
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:45.840]   Well, a big one with the young people especially is do a better job on YouTube
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.840]   In fact, we've lost people like Chad Johnson who believe very firmly, and he's young
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:55.840]   And he's probably right for his generation, that's where the future was
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.840]   On YouTube, and I disagreed
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:01.840]   But what we did is we let him start his show here
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:04.840]   And as soon as it got good, he said, "Alright, take it to YouTube"
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:08.840]   And I said, "Alright, normally in a normal business we'd say no, we own this show, we own all the assets
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:13.840]   And we put over $100,000 into generating those assets and that show's success
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.840]   But you know what, I love you Chad, so go out and go do it and have fun on YouTube
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.840]   That's your mission, it's not our mission
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.840]   So that's a big one
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:27.840]   We don't, nobody who comes here really says, "Oh, we ought to do more Linkbait"
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:29.840]   I think that comes from the top down
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:34.840]   That comes from pressure from the boss to generate more views
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:37.840]   The business model, because all we're selling is volume small
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:42.840]   I was talking to a media company the other day and I said, "Listen, you have this huge reach now
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:46.840]   And the one thing that they say in media these days is that reach is good for conversion
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:49.840]   The problem is you have nothing to convert people to"
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.840]   All you want to have is the mass product
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:55.840]   I've always said, and this is something else to tell our staff, "Better, not bigger"
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.840]   We're not trying to get more audience
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:00.840]   We're trying to serve the audience, we have better
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:03.840]   And we feel that that will give us the best benefit
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:07.840]   And we'll grow, and we do grow, some like 5-10% a year
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.840]   So as we're growing, I guess that's good
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.840]   I'd hate to see shrinking
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.840]   But all of our shows grow about 10%
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:16.840]   Some more, some less
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:20.840]   And that's fine with me, I don't want to become mass media
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:21.840]   I think that would be a mistake
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.840]   No, it's a dying bottle
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.840]   Alright, we ran out of time with that fabulous discussion
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:27.840]   Oh, why do we ran over, yeah?
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.840]   We actually did, we had to go to TNT
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:32.840]   So why don't we wrap things up with the back of the book
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.840]   As I say, Jeff, you got a number?
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:36.840]   Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.840]   How about you, Kevin, you got something you'd like to plug or promote?
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:44.840]   Well, we've changed the URL for IndieWeb
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.840]   So it's now indieweb.org
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:50.840]   Oh, I like it even better, because there's no camping involved
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.840]   Right, well the camping still happens
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.840]   But IndieWeb.org is on new site
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.840]   That's a good title, that's a good indieweb.org
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:58.840]   Alright, and it looks a bit cleaner
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:54:59.840]   Oh, I like it, yeah
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.840]   We have Homebrew website club tonight
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.840]   In San Francisco, Portland
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:09.840]   And the Bellingham Washington
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.840]   Oh, Los Angeles too, maybe?
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.840]   Ah, I didn't know what it was in Los Angeles
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.840]   And we've got IndieWeb.com coming up
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.840]   There's one in New York in August
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:24.840]   So pay attention to that, Jeff, go along, bring your friends
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:27.840]   And there's one in Brighton in September
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:30.840]   And then Los Angeles in November
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.840]   The other indieweb stuff that's going on
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:39.840]   Is that WebMention and MicroPob are still going through W3C, social web working group
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:42.840]   To candidate recommendations at the moment
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:46.840]   So basically, these are the things we've been using for a while
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:49.840]   WebMention is one site telling another that is linked to it
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:53.840]   So you can transfer comments and RSVPs and things like that
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:56.840]   MicroPob is letting me post to one site from another site
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:59.840]   So giving you permission to post on my site
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:02.840]   Or rather, make it easier for me to post on my site from your site
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:08.840]   And those are sort of baseline protocols that we've moved to W3C
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:12.840]   They're at the stage now where we're trying to make them into actual official standards
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:16.840]   Which means if you've heard of, we talked about them before and was interested by them
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:19.840]   Love them up now, check them out, test your implementations
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:23.840]   We've got test suites and test cases for both, so you can try this out
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:29.840]   Because we need to make sure that we've got this stuff right before it gets turned into a formal standard
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:33.840]   So this is like, this is, can the recommendation means
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.840]   We're in the state where we think we've got this right, but we're able to make changes to it
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.840]   So help us make sure we have got it right
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.840]   Excellent, in new web.org, it's all there
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.840]   Yep, that's the stuff there
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.840]   Love that
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.840]   Promoting the idea of a web standards
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:52.840]   What a thought, what a notion, what a concept
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.840]   Jeff Jarvis, did you find your number?
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:56.840]   So yeah, I did, so too
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:58.840]   Tonsa on July 1 started two new flights
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:04.840]   And this goes, I've been talking about this, it's going back to the days of what Google do
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.840]   When I've talked about what a social airline looks like
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:11.840]   And I love this, and there are some friends there who have been charged with this
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.840]   And I've had discussions about this, if that's disclosure
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.840]   They announced a flight going from Frankfort to San Jose, they call a lab flight
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:24.840]   And on the flight over, it was all Samsung VR stuff
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:26.840]   Oh, that would be so cool
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.840]   They can try out all the technology, because it's a long flight
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.840]   It's a great way to throw up
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:32.840]   They can try out the technology, then they also have guest speakers
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:36.840]   And you can watch on your phone or your tablet or your laptop over the Wi-Fi
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:38.840]   With the guest speakers, then you can try out
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:40.840]   I said, oh, I want to do that
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:44.840]   And on the way back, they're doing, they did sleep technology
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.840]   Oh, fun
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:48.840]   Are they doing more of those?
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.840]   Ariana, yeah, that's the plan
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.840]   That's kind of a thing
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.840]   I just lost the earpiece
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.840]   What a great idea
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.840]   Yeah, I thought it was a great idea, I wanted to give them a plug
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:06.840]   Torsten Vingett, is my friend there who's done really neat stuff
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:09.840]   And I guess I should also disclose I'm officially a member, I don't get paid
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:13.840]   We're a member of the Lufthans Innovation Lab advisory board
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:21.840]   But this is, I mean, why should you just be trapped in a metal tube?
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:22.840]   Right
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.840]   As a commodity, they can make these flights special
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:30.840]   Well, I would guess there's a pretty brisk business from Silicon Valley to Frankfurt and back
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.840]   Oh, yeah, yeah, there's the other event, you know, imagine the special flights
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:40.840]   KLM did this a while ago, where people on social media urged them to have one flight to some kind of music conference
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:43.840]   But, you know, German flat, Germans have taken over South by Southwest
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.840]   Every German I know goes to South by Southwest
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:46.840]   They really love it, really?
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:49.840]   Oh, yeah, marketers and Germans, it's all, we're not funny
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:52.840]   Marketers and Germans are there, but imagine special flights to South by Southwest
[01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.840]   Where you know where they're going, you know who's going
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:59.840]   You can have content going over, you can meet other people, you can try out things
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.840]   It's brilliant, so airlines should be doing this more and more
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:06.840]   Can you imagine somebody who got on that flight by accident?
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:07.840]   Yeah, I know
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:10.840]   Didn't realize what he was getting into
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:12.840]   Why is everyone walking around in these goggles?
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:13.840]   Who's this guy?
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:15.840]   Why is he talking to everybody?
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.840]   What is this Torsten guy up to?
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:19.840]   When's dinner?
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:21.840]   How fun, I would love to do that
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.840]   Well, let me call this one, you've been on these cruises
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:26.840]   You know what, this is one of the reasons I actually like cruises
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:30.840]   Is the idea of kind of a track of education
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:32.840]   I used to get cruises for years
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:36.840]   Where we would do a conference, Macmania or something else
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:39.840]   And I love that idea of travel plus education
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:42.840]   I didn't end up being working vacations
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:45.840]   And I don't think those two words should go together
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.840]   Yeah, yeah
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:49.840]   So now I do vacation vacations
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:57.840]   But I suspect as I get older, I could see myself ending my years on a Qunard vessel
[01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:01.840]   Teaching people of similar vintage shadows get email
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:03.840]   I see myself
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:05.840]   I just see myself
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:07.840]   Now press the send button
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:09.840]   You don't have goggles on
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.840]   You see this gesture
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:14.840]   Yeah, okay, now swipe left
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.840]   There you go, now you've got it
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.840]   Swipe, no, no, don't take out your handkerchiefs
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:22.840]   No, not wipe, swipe
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:25.840]   Oh Lord
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:29.840]   Oh, we have fun and I am so glad
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.840]   I love just sitting around with my buddies
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.840]   Talking about interesting stuff
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.840]   Just Sean, smart people
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.840]   There's nothing like a Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.840]   at CUNY
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.840]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.840]   He's a very, very big thinker
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:47.840]   And we love talking to him every week
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:48.840]   Thank you, Jeff
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:50.840]   Traveling next week, or will you be with us?
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.840]   I'm going down to Florida for today's
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.840]   But I'm coming back in time to the show, by God
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:56.840]   He'll be less pink
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.840]   Last time last week I was in Austin
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.840]   And there was weather and equipment stuff
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:02.840]   And I was supposed to get home at 9pm
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:04.840]   I got home at 4.30am
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:06.840]   That was dangerous
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:07.840]   I'm hoping
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.840]   I need to run to get a San Francisco in time
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:10.840]   for this hungry website club, so
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:11.840]   Hey, Kevin, Kevin, Mark,
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:12.840]   It's good timing, we're done
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:14.840]   Perfect timing Kevin Marks.com at
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.840]   Kevin Marks indieweb.org
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:18.840]   Thank you Kevin, thank you, Jeff
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.840]   Thank you everybody for joining us
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.840]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:23.840]   1.30pm Pacific
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:26.840]   4.30pm Eastern 2030
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:28.840]   UTC on Twit Live
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:29.840]   If you watch
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:30.840]   Join us in the chat room too
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.840]   So we can see your comments
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:33.840]   IRC.Twit.tv
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:34.840]   You can also be in the studio
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:36.840]   I had a nice studio audience today
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:37.840]   Welcome to all of you
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.840]   Just email tickets
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:39.840]   It's with .tv
[02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:40.840]   We'll put a seat out for you
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:42.840]   Our new studio, I should mention this
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:44.840]   We're going to be here
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:48.840]   And we think we're moving August 21st
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:50.840]   So we will not have
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:52.840]   A studio audience on August 20th
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.840]   or 21st
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.840]   Because it won't be much here
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.840]   The chairs will have been moved
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:01.840]   If it's possible we will have to delay it
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.840]   If the contractor gets behind
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:04.840]   To August 28th
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.840]   But it will either be that weekend
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:08.840]   That's why we want you to email
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:09.840]   Tickets at Twit.tv
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:11.840]   So we can let you know what the plan is
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:12.840]   I do think what we're going to do though
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:13.840]   That day
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.840]   We've rented a motorized cable car
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:17.840]   Because we can't walk to the new studio
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.840]   So the plan is that Sunday
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.840]   Whether it's 21st or 28th
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.840]   That I will finish the radio show
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.840]   Because we'll still have the one radio studio
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:26.840]   Left
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:28.840]   Finish the radio show
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.840]   And then everybody who's left
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:32.840]   Will grab a few things
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:34.840]   I'll take my Emmy and my clock
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:35.840]   That's all I care about
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.840]   And get on the cable car
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:39.840]   And we'll have a live streaming camera with us as well
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:42.840]   And we'll stream the drive to the new place
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:44.840]   And you'll catch a few Pokemon along the way
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:45.840]   We probably will
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:47.840]   We are Team Red here at Twit
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.840]   Vala, sorry Chris
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:55.840]   And we will then do Twit from the new studio
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.840]   And it'll be an all-in studio Twit
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:00.840]   So some people will be
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.840]   We could have audience for that, right?
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:03.840]   Or no?
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:04.840]   Yeah
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:05.840]   So just email, you know what?
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:08.840]   Email us, we don't know exactly
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:10.840]   We don't know yet how many people will fit
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:13.840]   And how many chairs will have and all that stuff
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:16.840]   A team is amassing because we are now going to take
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:18.840]   Team Vala over to the seed bank
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:20.840]   And take it back for Red Team
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.840]   Sorry Chris
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.840]   Thanks for joining us
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:28.840]   And we will see you next week
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:31.840]   On this week in Go Go, bye-bye
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:41.840]   [Music]
