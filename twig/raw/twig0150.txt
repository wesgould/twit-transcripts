[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220]   Coming up, it's Twig.
[00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.260]   This week at Google with Gina Jeff and a visit from James Spann, a weatherman whose Facebook page was taken down.
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.060]   We'll also talk about the hot new Google phone.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.900]   And I got it.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.240]   He has three, my review.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.900]   Coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.940]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.360]   The show that talks about Google, the cloud.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.800]   We'll talk a little about Facebook as well today.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.520]   Gina Trapani is here from smarterwear.org.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.400]   Great to have you, Gina.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.920]   Great to be here.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920]   Yay.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.720]   And we only have a little bit of Jeff.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.920]   We're going to have an hour of Jeff.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.280]   We've got an hour of plus, yeah.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.160]   An hour of Jeff.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.200]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.760]   Where are you?
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.880]   You're not at the City University of New York, where you normally haunt.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.040]   I'm in Toronto and I stayed longer after meeting and taking the last flight out so I can be on Twig.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.320]   On you on Air Canada.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.920]   It's a quick flight to New York, though.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   It's not a bad flight.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   It is.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920]   It's the last flight out.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.520]   No Air Canada.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.440]   Last time I was here, the pilots had a Wildcat strike.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.720]   Drove me absolutely bad.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.920]   So no, I flew United this time.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.320]   Next time I'll fly Porter, not Air Canada.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320]   I flew.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.920]   I did a lot of flying on Air Canada every month for four years or something.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.840]   I would fly up to Toronto.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.720]   I liked Toronto, though.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.400]   It's a great town.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.920]   I love Toronto.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.120]   It is a magnificent town.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.400]   I almost moved here twice.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.120]   Really?
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.440]   Oh, you like it that much?
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.320]   I don't like it that much.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   It's too cold.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   I don't think I could.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   Now we have an unusual guest.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.640]   We're going to start off with James Spann, who is a wonderful fellow.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   He's a meteorologist.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   He along with Kevin Sell.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   Is it Sells?
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   Is that how Kevin pronounces?
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   It's less than Selly.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   Selly.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   Kevin Selly.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   Does a podcast called Weather Brains because he's a meteorologist.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.600]   And James has done an amazing work in the past with hurricanes using Twitter and social
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.960]   media.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.280]   Was this last year that you were warning people?
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.600]   Yeah, our big day Leo was April 27th of last year.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   We had a generational tornado outbreak in which just in my state alone, the death toll
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.840]   was 252 and around the region it was wherever 300.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   So that was the 27th of last year.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.240]   These are the Alabama herd, tornadoes.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.880]   And he's in Birmingham, right?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.080]   Yes, that's correct.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   WBMA?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.800]   Yes, the ABC affiliate here.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.400]   And WCFT and WJSU Hoover, Alabama.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.480]   I'm actually more excited about being on Twitter than anything.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.280]   I'm a Twitter fan.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.360]   Well, and I'm a fan of Weather Brains because you know, it's something about weather.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.160]   People get fascinated and addicted and hooked.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.720]   So James is doing good stuff.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.920]   I mean, yeah, he's on TV, but by using Twitter, you were using your Twitter feed to follow
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.960]   the tornado's path to warn people that they, the tornado was on the way.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.640]   Was it really a remarkable thing you were doing?
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.400]   Well, social media is very powerful, Leo, and I think I have learned a lot, there's still
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   a lot to learn.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.960]   But I think we used it very effectively last year to not only warn people about the danger
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.480]   on that day, which was historic, but also for us to gather information back.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.760]   You know, it used to be I could not buy a report from some rural parts of this state,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.240]   but now with social media, we can get them by crowdsourcing it almost any time.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.480]   So it's a two way kind of thing and social media is absolutely crucial to what we do.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.280]   And it's an interesting use of so you use Google plus for this as well.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.400]   Yes, I was in there like, like all of you at the beginning.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   Right.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   I find it a very robust platform and it almost was my exclusive platform this past weekend.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.280]   Well, and that's kind of why we're having you on because I guess Facebook deleted your
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.480]   page. What happened?
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.240]   I don't know.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.920]   This past weekend, I was getting set to post some information on the Facebook like page.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.680]   And again, a lot of people live in that world.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.360]   I don't, but many people do.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.680]   And as you know, you've got to go where people are, which is what we try and do.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.600]   And that page has about 99,000 likes and we were getting set to have an active day the
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.800]   next day and I couldn't pull it up.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.280]   And I noticed at the same time an email came in from Facebook that said your account has
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.360]   been disabled with no explanation.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.720]   And of course, you know, the regular account has been maxed out at the 5,000 limit, like
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   everybody else for a long time.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.640]   And now you can subscribe, of course.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.920]   And that means that you can have many more people following.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.680]   What is then now the counts back, we should say it was it right?
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.480]   It came up 12 hours later, but for those 12 hours, I had, I didn't know what to do.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.680]   So I finally found a form for those people that have had their accounts disabled.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.880]   And I went through that form and filled it out and got an email back, which I guess was
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.840]   automated, and they asked for my driver's license, which I thought was a little bizarre.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.920]   This is when it started getting creepy.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.560]   They thought you were impersonating James.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.120]   I guess they did.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.320]   So I had to, you know, scan my state driver's license, photo ID and send that to this Facebook
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   email account.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.760]   I did not know a specific person I was dealing with.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.160]   There was no name.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.440]   And I blacked out all of my personal information, the driver's license number, the address.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.040]   I just had my photo showing in my name and I woke up the next morning just assuming it
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.880]   was a mistake and it was still down.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.000]   So, you know, I started the Twitter stink bomb thing, which I didn't know what else to
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.160]   do because later that day with active weather, I needed that account back because a lot of
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.280]   people get weather information during severe weather only by social media.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.240]   Many young people don't watch, you know, these newscasts we do, you know, this is Ron
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.920]   Burgundy stuff from the 70s and it's just for older people.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.760]   And we reach a lot of younger people with social media.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.320]   So I had great concern and, you know, I do okay on Twitter.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.000]   I don't have your numbers, Leo, but I think I've got about 62,000 there and they're pretty
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.160]   vocal.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.360]   And that started to kind of, you know, started to roll.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.160]   It's like a snowball going downhill and it just came back magically mid-morning Sunday.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.240]   So it was out for about 12 hours and there was no email to tell me it was back.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.400]   There was no communication explaining why they yanked it.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.960]   And it's horrifying because, you know, we are using that platform as a very critical
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.040]   way of disseminating severe weather information.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.760]   And understand when you've got an F4F5 tornado on the ground, this is serious business.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.760]   This is life-threatening.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.800]   So it's scary stuff.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.440]   And I guess I'd love to know, number one, why they disabled it.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   Did they think I was imposter?
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.960]   Did they think I was posting something ugly?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.080]   I mean, there's nothing on that page but just weather information that there's nothing
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.880]   controversial and politics.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.320]   It makes no sense at all.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.720]   And I tried to, you know, send people over to, you know, Google+, and hopefully I, you
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.760]   know, got a lot of people signed up for that and it's just, you know, it's very scary.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.320]   It shows the strength of social media but also its weakness, which is, you know, these
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   are private companies.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.200]   We don't really control.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.920]   It's not broadcasting, which is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, you
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.440]   know, it's, it's just a private company and they can do it.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.480]   They effectively can do what they want.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.960]   What people said, we'll just get a lawyer and sue these people.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.200]   Well, you can't sue them because they can yank that account anytime they want.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   It's their privilege.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.760]   They have the right to do that.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.320]   I have emailed the heads of PR at Facebook in Washington and in California to ask them.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.680]   And so we can get some facts here and actually discuss the facts.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   It's bizarre.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.880]   And I think it probably is a case of wanting to make sure that you were who you say you
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.880]   were.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   What is it?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.160]   So you're @spann on Twitter.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   What is the Facebook?
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.280]   It's facebook.com/JamesSpan.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.480]   I have two ends on my name and that's the like page.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:48.840]   My personal account is just span, but the page that we use for content is that one.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.200]   And again, if you look at it, it's on a day like today, we have calm weather here today.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.440]   It's about weather information.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.440]   I promoted it.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.240]   By the way, you've got the weather weenies of the world over here now.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.960]   The weather brains crowd have invaded the twig audience.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.800]   We were, I see you were watching the Venus transit as we were.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.240]   We were fascinated by that.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.000]   Oh, that was great stuff.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.280]   Yeah, that NASA video, we can't stop watching that.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.440]   The sun is so beautiful.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.400]   Well, James, I'm sorry that happened.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   We'll try to find out.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   Thank you, Jeff, for doing some actual reporting.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.960]   Yeah, when I, obviously it was the last minute, but as soon as I hear something all along.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.680]   We'll give their point of view on it.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.600]   Leo and Jeff and Gina here.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.200]   These are three big shots that can try and find out some answers.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.840]   Well, I know, and I certainly don't want to slam Facebook because we don't know what
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.600]   happened, but I think the takeaway is that we more and more are relying on social media
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.320]   and private companies for this kind of dissemination of information and there is no, there's no
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.320]   protection.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.120]   I mean, it's just, you know, it's up to them what they want to do.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   It makes you wonder if our relationship has to change.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   Right.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   Gina, go ahead.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.120]   No, no, sorry, Jeff.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.560]   What was you going to say, you know, when these networks become these very important,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.680]   you know, vital distribution platforms, you wonder if the relationship between the user
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.000]   and the company has to change.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.640]   I mean, right now it's a free service that's advertising based, right?
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.200]   But in a situation like this, you know, do you want to be able to purchase the service,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.800]   you know, or purchase access to a live help person, for example, in this case?
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.520]   I mean, who knows what this was.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.360]   It's possible that maybe the page was hacked.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   Maybe there was unusual activity.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.800]   Maybe there were just algorithms that detected unusual activity and it was a security issue.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.080]   I mean, who knows what it was.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.040]   But you know, James, I'm wondering like, does what happened make you rethink the way
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.080]   that you use Facebook at all?
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.960]   Do you feel like are you thinking, you know, that you could move off to, you know, a separate
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.720]   site or I mean, it's you really kind of in a tough position, right?
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.160]   Because you're trading control for distribution.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.840]   And again, you know, it's like Leo, you know, Leo, you tried to get off Facebook once.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   You can't back.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   You can't.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   You're right.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   You can't pull it back.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.040]   That's where people are living.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.400]   It's this wall garden a oil 2.0 thing.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.520]   And I have to reach them out there.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.800]   Of course, we try and bring them to our sites, you know, the blog we do and all of that.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.560]   But a lot of people will not go there.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.640]   They just get the information by Facebook.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.640]   And so I would pay, you know, I need some kind of consistency with this.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.320]   So I know that the products are distributing the other thing that frustrates us, I guess,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.600]   is the fact that I can't monetize this.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.920]   You know, now if I start putting ad messages on here, yeah, that they will.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.680]   Oh, yeah, sure they will.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   In a hard way.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   Well, you can.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.880]   And I think that's our starting to use the Facebook reader.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.400]   You have the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the Guardian.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.760]   And so there is a beginning of a model where your company could monetize.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.480]   The other thing is that, you know, when my credit card company suddenly says there's
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.040]   suspicious activity in the one hand, it's inconvenient.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.240]   It's a pain, but I'd far rather them do that if they're if in the end it's happened and
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.960]   they protect me and protect my identity.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.880]   And that's part of what's going on here is is protecting identity.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.880]   And I don't know why.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   I just got this email back from head of PR in the Washington office of Facebook.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.920]   And this was obviously very last minute, but he contacted his ops team and he said that
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.680]   I can say that Facebook has confirmed this was an error and they apologize for any inconvenience.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680]   There you go.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   Okay.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   Well, there you go.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   That's fine.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.040]   It really is about the larger issue, which we've talked about so many times in this show
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   about having your own website that you control.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.600]   And of course, we all agree that Gina and I have talked about this a lot that you have
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.800]   to do that.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.320]   But you make the excellent point, James.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.160]   When you're talking to normal people as opposed to our audience, which are geekier people,
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.520]   you talk to normal people who that's how they are on the net.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.680]   They see Facebook as the as the internet.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.480]   And I can't reach them with the traditional television method.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.720]   And having said that, you know, obviously during tornado outbreaks, television is still
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.560]   a primary distribution method.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.320]   The numbers are huge.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.080]   But on the day of April 27th last year on Ustream, we had 70,000 concurrent live streams
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.720]   in the Facebook and the Twitter usage, I think, was critical.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.440]   I will tell you right now, there are people that are walking around in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.300]   And that was one of the many towns hit so hard that day because these people got the
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.000]   tornado warning via Facebook or Twitter.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   We didn't have a Google+ back then.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.240]   It is a critical platform for us.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.280]   And I'm hoping that our friends within these companies understand the critical nature of
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   that.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.920]   And I guess the only thing I was looking for was a warning.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.360]   But if it was a mistake, I feel better that Jeff found out.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.160]   So that's a nice thing about being on this show.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.880]   You got important people that find out things.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   I had no clue.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.480]   I mean, I had no clue.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.480]   Jeff has the context.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.080]   So thank you for pursuing that, Jeff.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.200]   And thank you, James, for joining us.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.080]   James is on Twitter, SPA and N. And of course, it's James SPA and N on Facebook.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.760]   And it is up now, 100,000 people.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.400]   You get 100,000 in one because I just liked it, like it.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.360]   And it is, if you're in the Birmingham or the Alabama area, certainly something you'll
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   want to use.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.680]   I just wish there were some sort of way to do this that we're guaranteed to be up.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.880]   But there isn't.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.080]   That's kind of the nature of the internet.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080]   Thank you, James.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   Hey, thanks, guys.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.720]   I got to go do some local television across the hall.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   You'll have a great day.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   My privilege to be here.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   Thanks, James.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.000]   The old fashioned way.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.240]   I do TV the old fashioned way.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   It was cameras.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.240]   Expedibly.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   Yeah, really.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   Thank you, James.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.600]   Thank you, Jeff, for pursuing that.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.680]   And I mean, that's I think that's what we thought had happened.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.080]   That something went wrong.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.640]   And there was some issue about verification and they said, oh, well, we can, you know,
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.720]   send us your driver's license.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.360]   But this is a problem with Google with all these companies.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.640]   Now, they're so big when you have 800 million users, how do you, how do you do support?
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   You can't.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.960]   James podcast is at weatherbrains.com, by the way, and I forgot to mention the official
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.520]   net cast for people who love weather.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.520]   There it is.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   Weatherbrains.com.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.560]   And they've done more of those than we have done of quick, 332 weather episodes.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.280]   It's actually really always weather.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.920]   It's a really good podcast.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.000]   I really enjoy it.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.920]   All right, let's move on to more news from the world of Google.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.320]   From the cloud to the cloud.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.320]   Can I show you my new phone?
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.320]   Oh, please.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   What if we said no, Leo?
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.280]   What if we said we don't want to see it?
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.760]   No, we don't want to go home.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   Just another Android.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.200]   Yes, please show it to us.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.720]   Well, we didn't, you know, it's funny when they did the announcement.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.120]   We debated whether we should cover the announcement live as we would do, certainly with an iPhone
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   announcement.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   And that's the problem with Android.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.880]   Yes, this is going to be a big deal, but is there are there's a new Android handset every
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.720]   week and the HTC one, which is fantastic, the Galaxy Note, which I have been using for
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.760]   a long time.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.800]   My favorite on before the note was the Galaxy S2.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.840]   A lot of attention when Samsung announced that they were going to do a Galaxy S3.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.480]   I ordered and I did this.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.000]   I've done this before.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.200]   If you want it is now, we know going to be available on all four major carriers in the
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:07.320]   Galaxy S4 Ryzen, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, that it will be available June 21st on some
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.320]   of them.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.000]   Verizon won't have it until July, but you know, as always, you can order an unlocked European
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.240]   version if you're willing to spend the unlocked price, which in this case was $650.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.720]   And it won't go to full speed here, right?
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.960]   It will on AT&T.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.920]   It's not LTE, but it will go.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.960]   Let me, let me go back here.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.960]   It will go.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.000]   I don't want to show all my personal information.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.160]   By the way, I love it when you get a new Google phone.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.600]   It just downloaded all my apps and everything just here.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   It looks really smooth.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.120]   It's like, you swipe through those screens.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.120]   It looks beautiful.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.360]   WAD Core baby really makes a difference.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.360]   This thing is...
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.360]   Yeah, that screen is huge too.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   It looks like...
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   Yeah, so 4.8 inches.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.640]   Do you Leo to compare them?
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640]   I do.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.520]   John, would you get my notes?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.640]   It's in the drawer of the office there.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.880]   It's smaller than the note.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.120]   This is 4.8 inches.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.280]   So it's, and it's by the way, it is really thin.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.240]   The Galaxy S2 had a little bump at the bottom for a radio transmitter.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.880]   I'll compare it to the thickness of a pencil and you can see that it...
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.400]   I love that gag.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.680]   I just keep using that gag.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   Here's the gala...
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   No.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.040]   Everybody on Twitter, I apologize.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.440]   They've seen this for years.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   Here's the...
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.840]   Back from the place where phones go to die.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   Yeah, back.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.320]   Yeah, because you notice I reset it.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.960]   It's already saying villekommen, bienvenu, welcome.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.800]   So there's the Galaxy Note.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.920]   So it's noticeably bigger.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   It is...
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.000]   Oh yeah, it's not note size, but I mean a lot of people didn't like the note because
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   it wasn't one-handed.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Well, this is much more one-handed.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.560]   It's not a fable.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   It's not a fable.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.560]   It's not a fable.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   It's not a fable.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   But a 4.8 inches.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.160]   And by the way, 1280 by 720.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.280]   So this is actually close to the resolution of a 13-inch power book.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.240]   It's 300 more than 300 dots per inch.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.680]   So it is a retina display.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   And it is...
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   Well, it is a super amoled.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.760]   It is pen tile, but I have to say I don't have any of the pen tile color noise issues
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.120]   that I saw.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.580]   And it wasn't too crazy about with the Nexus...
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.120]   This Galaxy Nexus.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.840]   The whites are really white.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.000]   The text is incredibly crisp.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.600]   Very, very legible.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.880]   This is a very fast phone.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   That's chrome.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   That's chrome.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   And is that the default browser?
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.880]   No.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.280]   Chrome comes with a traditional default browser.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.080]   Comes with a lot of Samsung craps.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   Although they're not...
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   I have to say touch...
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   Don't have some good stuff from Samsung.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   TouchWiz 4 is not bad.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.240]   This is TouchWiz.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.760]   It is on ICS 4.04.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.400]   But TouchWiz 4 is not horrible.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.200]   And it does have some...
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   The Samsung apps.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.400]   I thought it was going to have a stylus.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.880]   It doesn't have a stylus.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.640]   But it does come with S-M-O-S voice, which is the Siri clone and actually is quite good.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.520]   It is PlayBob Dylan.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.960]   And it's really quick.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.040]   It's actually faster than Siri.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.840]   It does a pretty good job of understanding text messages or opening applications.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.000]   Things Siri cannot do.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.040]   I'm actually kind of fond of this.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   She speaks.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.200]   Does it have a she that speaks to you?
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   Yes.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   I believe that she speaks.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   I don't remember off the top of my head.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   Samsung then comes with a planner and a few other things.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.840]   Video Hub, Music Hub.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.680]   Actually, the music player is quite good.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.400]   Good enough that I made it my default music player.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.240]   One thing I really like about the Samsung music player, it supports DLNA.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.760]   So at home, I have two DLNA devices.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.720]   My AV receiver from Oculo and an internet radio, the Grace Mondo.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.800]   They both show up here.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.400]   They're not showing up here because I'm not at home on this.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.240]   If I'm listening to a song, I can send it right to my stereo.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.000]   In seconds, it's playing on the stereo.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.720]   Same thing with video.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.360]   I can be watching video here and send it right to the TV set.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.960]   So that DLNA is actually kind of like AirPlay.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.200]   Works quite nicely.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.800]   That's nice.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.320]   Quad Core 1.4 gigahertz XNO's processor.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.680]   That will not be the case.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.520]   I'm not sure, but I understand that will not be the case on all the US carriers.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.240]   I think there may not be a quad core.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.960]   One of the things I really like in the teardown, I fix it, publish the teardown.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:27.720]   It has the same exact camera app or not app sensor as the iPhone 4S.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   It has its own app, but I think quite a good app, including the ability to shoot bursts,
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.360]   HDR, a panorama, built-in panorama that was quite good.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.760]   In fact, I posted on my Google+ account a panorama.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.760]   It was fun.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   And if you zoom in, it looks good.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.000]   I'll tell you what, I'll shoot a quick panorama here just to give you an idea of how quick
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   it is.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   We'll shoot here.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.400]   You just do this.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   I'm in the camera.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.800]   Let me put it in panorama mode here.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.080]   And that's the Samsung camera app.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   That's not the ICS.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.320]   This is the Samsung app, not the ICS app, although I think the ICS app has similar capabilities.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.920]   I'll start here.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.120]   It keeps you level.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.160]   You just slowly rotate it and it takes the pictures when it gets to where it needs to.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.640]   With this app, you really see the speed of the quad core processors.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.240]   Once I'm done, I think it takes eight or nine images.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.920]   I'm actually going a little slower than I did when I took the...
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.600]   I'm just rotating it around like that.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.360]   And when it's done, I'll make sure I can tell you when it's about to do this.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   It's done.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   It's stitched.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.920]   It didn't take any time to do the stitch, which is kind of amazing.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.480]   And here, let's turn it sideways.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.480]   Here it is.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   Oh, cool.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   Wow.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480]   It's really good.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   Sorry, Gina.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.240]   She was blinking.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   She was blinking.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.160]   But really, I mean, that did that instantly.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.840]   And as far as I can tell, there are no solutions.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.400]   At least you're in the picture, Gina.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   No, Jeff's kind of sorta.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   Right?
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   There he is.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   Oh, there you go.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.560]   I went Gina to Jeff.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.960]   So yeah, this is the Samsung app.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.840]   I think the Samsung app actually pretty good.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.600]   I think they do a pretty compelling job.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   So I'm impressed.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   I, you know...
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.920]   A flip board exclusive?
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   Oh, I didn't...
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.840]   Yes, I forgot to mention.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   Here's the flip board.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.600]   And flip board is just like on iOS.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.960]   It's excellent.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.040]   Same as the iOS where you flip up.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.880]   It immediately recognized, I logged into my flip board account and downloaded all my
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.560]   flip board sources.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.240]   It doesn't have audio or it doesn't.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.200]   Let me check.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.040]   Has video, but no audio.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.360]   So they haven't updated that yet.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   I think that's only on the iPad.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.200]   I don't remember if that's on the iPhone yet.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.440]   I don't think it is.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   It's just...
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.000]   Yeah, I love flip board.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   I'm very happy to have flip board on here.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.840]   That looks really nice.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.560]   You get 50 gigabytes of Dropbox storage for free for two years, by the way.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   Really?
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.920]   As when you buy the phone, it just comes with extra Dropbox?
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.560]   Don't know why, but it does.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.960]   So all in all, I must say I love it.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.120]   Two thumbs up to a steal from Cisco and Ebert.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.880]   Good size, it's a nice intermediate between the Galaxy S2 and the Note.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.920]   Watch how small it is.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.880]   I'll tell you the negative.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.160]   It's slippery, thin and light.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.280]   I'm going to drop this for sure.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.480]   And of course, because there's no cases yet.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.360]   But I think they've done everything right.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   It's got a 1.9 megapixel front camera, so it's better than the front camera on any of
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   the iPhones.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.920]   I mean, this is Samsung saying, okay, let's see what you got, Apple.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.080]   And it'll be very interesting to see what Apple responds with this fall.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.000]   I'm sure that they'll be in a tug of war.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.120]   But a lot to be said for this, as you could feel how fast it is.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.400]   Yeah, that's a really nice phone.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   What's the deal with the colors?
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.640]   You can only get white now, but in red later, is there a white?
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.720]   They have white and blue and Verizon.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.960]   I think it's Verizon's going to have red.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.440]   The pebble blue, they were having some trouble with the back, not matching the front.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440]   I think they're shipping them.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   I'll ship them.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.440]   I got white.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   I thought, what the heck?
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   This is...
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.320]   Alright, so someone were buying a phone today, would you recommend this?
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   AT&T gets red.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.400]   Would you recommend this or the note or what?
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.240]   Oh, this is definitely the best Android phone by far.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   Yes.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   Not even question.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.480]   Compete's, I think, very nicely with the Galaxy.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.880]   I mean, the iPhone 4S, we'll see what happens with the iPhone 5.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.280]   And by the way, Apple is...
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.480]   I'll tell you how good it is.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.280]   Apple is calling for an early ban on it.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   Apple has a good indicator.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   You're still there.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.760]   There we are.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.600]   No, look how thin that is.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.880]   And it's very light.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.360]   For all the power in that thing, it's really kind of remarkable.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360]   Nice screen.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.520]   I was watching video on it last night.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.200]   Great HD screen.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   And so how are you feeling about it?
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.680]   I see us now that you're...
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.240]   Ah, I love it because this has buttons.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   Right.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   So I've got a menu button.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.160]   At the bottom, I've got the capacitance buttons that Samsung put on the note.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.680]   The menu is here, the back button is here, and the home button is here.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   I can really see...
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   I just saw the...
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.000]   Yeah, they actually glow kind of...
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.440]   You can't see it, but they glow very nicely, actually.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.080]   So as long as I always have a menu here, I don't...
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.800]   I see us does not bother me.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.880]   And there are other things I love about ICS.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   Oh, there they are.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.880]   Yeah, you can see them kind of.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   Very nice.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   Very nice.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   They're capacitive.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.600]   Lots of nice...
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.760]   Yeah, I mean, this is...
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.760]   You know what, ICS does...
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.400]   This is touch-ways on top of ICS, so ICS doesn't impinge.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.040]   Every once in a while, I'll see a menu button there.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.000]   But as long as I've got my menu button at the bottom of the physical menu button, I'm
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   all right.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.560]   I'm loving it.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.560]   And there's some nice things...
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.640]   Samsung put in some gestures so you can shake it.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.960]   Supposedly, and I don't know if this works, when the screen is off, let's see if it works.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.560]   I'm supposed to be able to put my finger on this turn it sideways and it launches the
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.560]   camera.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.520]   I haven't been able to figure out why that's not doing that.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.840]   There's some shake things.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.560]   If you are on a contact and you put the phone in your ear, it will dial that contact.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.960]   You can of course turn these things off.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.560]   But this is kind of wild.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.320]   Let me go to somebody I don't mind if I call them.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.360]   I'll call me.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360]   And I put it to my ear.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.120]   It should call me.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.600]   Maybe it's not doing that.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   So some interesting things.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.520]   This is the Galaxy S3.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.200]   It is going to be on all four carriers.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.160]   AT&T will have the red, pebble blue, and marble white on the other carriers.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.520]   This is comparable to the One X.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.360]   I like it a little better than the One X.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.840]   It certainly feels a lot thinner and lighter.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.040]   So quick review of the Galaxy S3.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:47.000]   I ordered it unlocked early so that I could talk about it.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Very impressive.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.280]   It lives up to all of the good things we've heard.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   So if you're buying a phone right now, I might wait until the end of the month, right?
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.880]   Oh, you got Google I/O and WWDC happening this month.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.880]   They'll be some announcements.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.840]   I don't think Apple's going to have an iPhone until September.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.480]   So that's when iOS 6 will come out.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   Right.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   That makes sense.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.480]   And you're right.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.080]   Google I/O they might announce the S4.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   So yeah.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.880]   I don't think they will.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.360]   Oh, and removable battery.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.040]   And I always order a couple extra batteries.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.760]   So that's one thing over the HTC.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.400]   Even though this is really thin, you can pop the battery.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.960]   It is a 21 milliamp hour battery, which is almost as big.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.560]   And the note is 2500.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   It's a big battery.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.080]   It's much bigger than the Galaxy S2.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.160]   So I don't know yet.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.960]   I haven't charged.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   I'm running on a single charge and I'm about half done.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.280]   But I've been using it like crazy.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:44.440]   So I think battery life is going to be strong on this thing.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.920]   Anything else you'd like to know?
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   Are you switching?
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   This is now your full time phone.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.600]   Yeah, I took the sim out of the iPhone.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   Okay.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.040]   Oh, that was something else I found out.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.680]   It's a micro sim, not a full sim.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:02.000]   And if you're going to cut down your regular sim, you got to do it really carefully.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.800]   Oh, well, you were sitting down yourself.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.440]   Don't recommend it.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.440]   I have a live or did you record that?
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.160]   I did on Liz's desk.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.800]   Liz saw me do it.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.920]   So I'm seven hours, nine minutes, 57 seconds on battery.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   It's 37% down.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.320]   29% of that was screen as usual on these big beautiful screens.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   They're the big ones.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.040]   But I wouldn't say unusual.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   This is good.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.680]   So I've got a third left.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.440]   So we're going to probably get eight or nine hours of heavy use.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.640]   So now I have to get a new sim.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.000]   So it didn't work.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.320]   Well, if I'd done it right or I got a sim cutter it would have.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.560]   Yes, you could totally do that.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.400]   But I was just like, hey, I'm just going to cut this.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.160]   And I think I clipped it a little bit.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.600]   And you know, I mean, and it fits very nicely.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.400]   But I know this is going to-- it's so slippery.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.720]   It's going to slide right out.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   It's going to hit the toilet.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.560]   Do you have to go to the store and admit that that's lit us?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.080]   Huh?
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.040]   Hello, I need to do sim.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.160]   Yeah, but you can AT&T.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:10.640]   You can do that.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.560]   You can say, hey, I got a new phone.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.040]   Can I give a sim?
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.840]   And they'll do that.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.560]   No problem.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.360]   They don't care as long as they don't care as long as you're a customer.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   If I want to go out and buy an unlocked phone, they don't mind.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.760]   I'm not asking for money back.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.160]   I'm just saying I want to be a customer some more.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.160]   So yeah, you can always get new sims.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.760]   You can say my sim fell out.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.360]   I'll tell them.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:31.960]   You know what?
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.360]   They know me at the AT&T store.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.560]   The last time I was in there, they said, oh, you drop your phone in the water, right?
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.360]   And I said, yeah.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   I need to do sim.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.360]   I appreciate the DIY spirit, Leo.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:43.960]   Oh, I liked it.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.360]   I just-- you know, careful when you're cutting.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   Get a cutter.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360]   It's better.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   It's better.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.360]   So Google had its event this morning.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.360]   Did you all watch it?
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   Didn't watch it.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.360]   No, when I saw the maps, they look cool.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   Yeah, I didn't watch either.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.360]   But--
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.360]   What's wrong with you guys?
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.360]   I didn't watch it.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   So this is Google clearly trying to steal a lead on Apple, which on Monday will have its
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   announcement that it's not going to use Google Maps anymore, I think, right?
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.160]   Yep, that's what it sounds like.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.360]   So what Google's trying to do is saying, are you sure we're going to be really good?
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   Blower heads off.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.360]   Here, check this out.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   So three key features, 3D models in Google Earth.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.120]   So offline maps, that's big.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.360]   So you can download the maps ahead of time.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.440]   Yeah, that's really nice.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.080]   That's a big deal.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.160]   And then something called Street View Backpack.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.000]   What's that?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   That's so that you can-- the apparatus can be taken into places where cars don't go.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Oh.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.360]   Right, so it's this backpack with this giant robot head with a bunch of cameras on top.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.520]   And this isn't, obviously, this isn't for users.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.440]   This is like Google is paying people to--
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.200]   But they'll have indoor street views now.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.920]   Right, well, hiking through national parks and that kind of thing and getting Street View
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   for those places.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.280]   Oh, Leo, you've got to get used to one of those.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   I want one of those.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   I don't--
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Do you want to talk to those also, Ben?
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.040]   It looks a little top heavy.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.640]   Leo, I want that for the studio.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.520]   OK, I want to wear one.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   Google--
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.520]   It looks enormous.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.520]   Google, come please.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.320]   Oh, look, there's Rafe Needleman trying to strap it in.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.800]   Wow, Rafe.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.200]   You've got to do it for him.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.520]   Rafe, come over here, Rafe.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.800]   He was on Twitter this Sunday.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.360]   He said he was going to this event.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.800]   Look at that, CNET's Rafe Needleman looking very sharp in a Google backpack with a Street
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.640]   View thing on it.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.640]   It looks like a soccer ball with cameras or something.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:50.080]   So Google basically has an army of pilots flying contracted planes around big cities,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   getting 3D imagery.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.080]   Yes, it is.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.880]   And now they've got an army of foot soldiers walking around with these backpacks on through
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.560]   national parks and places to get Street View images.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.200]   It really is.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.560]   It's really crazy when you think about it.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   Wow.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.560]   So I did get it.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.640]   I did get an update to Maps, but this is not the one.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.800]   I got an update this morning, but that's not the one.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   It's coming, right?
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.720]   Yeah, it's coming in the next few weeks.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.440]   It'll be Android only at first.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.480]   They're working on getting it to iOS, they said.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   Yeah, good luck.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.480]   Yeah, good luck.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   Exactly.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   What is going to happen there?
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.480]   Apple just cut them off.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.480]   No.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.480]   No, okay.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   No, you get.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.680]   In fact, that's probably what Google's thinking is, well, Apple plans to cut us off
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.160]   in September because they'll update everybody to iOS 6 and suddenly Apple Maps will replace
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.160]   Google Maps.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.520]   So we've got a few months to show them what we can do so that people switch, right?
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   What would be that?
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.640]   What would be the, they're not going to convince Apple to leave Google Maps and what they want
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.400]   to do is convince people to go to Android.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.280]   Well, let me, let me cause trouble for a second.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.000]   If Google gets in trouble for promoting its own products, then why shouldn't Apple get
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.920]   in trouble for promoting its own product if it's now a platform?
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.680]   You mean by putting as a restorative trade against Google?
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.680]   Well, so is Apple.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.360]   I'll tell you why it doesn't bother.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.560]   I know the answer, but, but, but, you know, there's just some kind of, if we all, if everybody
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.240]   goes after Google promoting your own stuff.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.360]   Because Google is not a normal company, Jeff.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.520]   Google has a higher responsibility as a search engine.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.720]   Apple is a normal company.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.720]   They sell a hardware product.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.200]   They make their own software.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.080]   They're not an agnostic search engine.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.480]   Well, they're way to say.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   So what's the difference?
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.280]   So whether it's a hardware product or whether it's, shall we say, an operating system with
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.920]   a browser in it?
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.840]   You know, the difference between Apple and Microsoft, I'm just trying to, you know, I
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   make it.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.000]   Well, that's the, that's a legitimate case where you could say, look, Apple has a huge,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   do they have a monopoly?
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Cause that was the only reason it made a difference from Michael's Shaft.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Right.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   They had a monopoly.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Neither.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Microsoft neither does Google.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   No, no, Microsoft, they did have a monopoly.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.840]   That's why the browser thing was an issue.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.520]   Because they had a monopoly.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.080]   They had a monopoly.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.080]   But, but Apple has a huge market share.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.320]   I mean, what's Apple's market share?
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.280]   The difference between big, it's less than 50%.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.720]   There's a difference between big market share and monopoly, huge difference.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   Same for Google.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   Same goes for Google.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.640]   Google has 65% or 63% in the US.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640]   It's not a monopoly.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   Not a monopoly.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.640]   Not a monopoly of search.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.040]   So I don't think they have a legal responsibility.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   I'm not, I'm not, I'm not asserting that.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.040]   I'm not arguing in this.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.600]   I'm saying they have a moral responsibility not to promote their products on search, which
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.360]   is supposed to be agnostic.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.800]   But the same with, you know, also I'm, I'm captive to this phone.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.920]   I'm captive for two years.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.160]   And now suddenly they're just going to change on me and say, no, no, no, Jeff, we're going
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.760]   to give you these maps instead.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.120]   And they're using that, that, that stranglehold to do that.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.640]   All I'm trying to say is I'm not, I'm not believing what I'm saying right now.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   Just be clear.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   I'm, I'm trying to play that.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   Well, good.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.640]   That makes it easier to argue against you.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.040]   You know, you don't really believe that.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   Do you?
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.120]   No, I know, I, I get what you're saying.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:54.680]   And, but, but, but look at really, Apple's, this should come as no surprise.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.720]   In fact, the surprise was that Apple was even allowing Google's maps on its phone.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.040]   Apple wants to control the entire user experience.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.240]   And the only reason they don't 100% control, look at you, you know, is because they, they
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.280]   don't have the resources to now they have the maps.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.600]   They're going to push Google out.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.600]   I'm sure.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   Right.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.400]   So, so what's the harm of Google promoting its own stuff then using its own service?
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.440]   Because so, so if, so if, yeah, what if, what if Google decided, I don't care if Google
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.600]   buys a billboard promoting its own services.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   I don't want them to take search results.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.440]   And the only risk to Google, there's no legal risk to Google.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.200]   It's merely that people will leave Google saying, I can't trust the results.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.600]   The problem is you, Bing is even worse.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.320]   And Google said, do no evil, which was a response to paid search results.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:50.120]   Google implied that they would be above this.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   Right.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   I mean, I paid that argument myself a few weeks ago.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.080]   But I'm just saying I think we get that everybody gets.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.960]   So paranoid about Google and.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.240]   Well, everybody's paranoid about Apple, but it's just kind of no, it's a known thing.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:08.880]   It's like, of course, apples, you know, oh, you're surprised that Apple's predacious.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.920]   You're surprised Apple wants to win it all costs.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.920]   Really.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.960]   And I know, I think it's been a long time since people have, and people did used to think
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.360]   of Apple this way, but it's been a long time since people thought of Apple as the nice
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.440]   company, the do no evil company, the company that cares more about you than profits.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.680]   Nobody's thought that about Apple in a long time.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   Have they?
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   No, no, no, no, no, we still like their stuff.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.480]   But we know that they're out to get us.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:45.280]   By the way, Google is not the only company bypassing Apple's privacy in an I ads.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.880]   This is apparently, I don't know if I have that story here.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.040]   I'll tell you what, I'll save it because I do want to talk about this.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   There's other.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.040]   I think it's in there.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040]   Is it in here?
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   Dank.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.280]   I do want to talk a little bit about this because this was with Google got in a lot of trouble.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.680]   It turns out there's everybody's doing it apparently.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:13.600]   But first, let's talk about stamps.com.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   How about that?
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   And then we'll come back.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   Jeff and Gina are here.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   We're talking about Google.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.160]   Jeff, I know you got about a half an hour left.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   No, no, we're fine.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   We're five, half an hour, 45 minutes.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.600]   Don't make it soft because I'll take every minute you give me.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.400]   You see, I'm very aw, I'm making planes.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   I'm extremely ironic.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.040]   It's two hours early.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   Oh, don't do it.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   Don't be like Bill Gates.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   You know what Bill Gates would do?
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   He would...
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   It's a freaking plane.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.240]   No, no, before he, but when he used to fly economy, this is when he used to fly economy,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.600]   he would wait to the very last minute to exactly how long it take to get from Microsoft's
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.960]   Redman headquarters to the Sea-Tac.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.680]   He would time it to the minute he would arrive.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   His goal was to arrive as the door was closing.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   He would do it every time.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.880]   No, that's way too stressful.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.280]   And then he'd get in the plane and he'd cover his head with a jacket.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   Go to sleep.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   And that was it.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   That's the last.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   He's famous.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.320]   Now those will all be the signs for being a terrorist.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   Exactly.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.920]   I'm sorry, Mr. Gates.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.640]   Take your shoes off now.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   We're brought to you today by the fines.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.600]   Anyway, we'll get you out of here at a reasonable...
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.240]   When's your flight?
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   830.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   Do you have a 530 flight?
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   No, no, no, no.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.080]   A car picking me up here, 540.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.080]   Wait, okay.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.040]   So it's five, your time now.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.240]   I'm at Don Mills Road.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.640]   Oh, I know where you are.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.640]   No, it's wrong.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   It's easy to get to run on airport.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.040]   It won't take you any time.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.320]   Especially on a Wednesday night.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.080]   How many flights have you ever missed, Leo?
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.560]   I've only missed one.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.960]   I'm actually famous for doing exactly what you do.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   Okay, all right.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.040]   I am late for everything.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.400]   I mean, everybody knows this.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400]   It's Leo time, right?
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.960]   I'm always late for this show.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.000]   But I'm always early for flights because there's a big difference.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.640]   I'm late for Twig, not a big deal.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:03.080]   If I'm late for a flight, your whole life gets a mess.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.880]   Rush hour in Toronto, it's not bad.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.560]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560]   We'll get you out of there at 530.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.320]   In fact, I don't know if you're going to make it.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.520]   I used to do the same thing because at the end of every week, I would go up to Toronto
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.960]   and shoot 15 shows in four days.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.160]   The last show would be the last thing on Friday.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.480]   I would make 730 flights.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.960]   I would leave at 530 from downtown.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.800]   I would always rush it.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:36.560]   This show brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.680]   You can't use it in Canada, sorry.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.040]   It's only for us Americans.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.040]   Stamps.com.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.040]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.040]   It's funny.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.240]   I thought we would get complaints from our Internet because 30 of our audience is international
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.680]   saying, "Why can't we use Stamps.com in our country?"
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:54.240]   Well, because it's United States postage, I guess you could, but it wouldn't be much
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   used to you.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.560]   Here's the idea.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   You can print.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.960]   Other countries, I think, are doing this.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.680]   The technical term is indicia.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.040]   You can print legal postage, legal US postage from your computer and your printer.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.160]   You don't need a postage meter anymore.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   You don't need special links.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.760]   You just need Stamps.com.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.440]   It means you will never go to the post office again.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.800]   You get the USB scale so you always have exactly the right postage for any letter or
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.000]   package.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.480]   It prints right on the envelope if you want, which is so cool.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.840]   You can print stickies just like a regular stamp.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   In fact, it even fills out forms for international mailing.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.000]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, it gets the data from the site and populates the mailing
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   label.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's just fantastic.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.200]   But wait, we have a special offer.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   Now, see right there?
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   A special $80 value.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.680]   That is a good deal.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.800]   Wait, no, I got a better deal.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.300]   We're going to add $30 to it right now.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:53.000]   Just click that microphone in the upper right hand corner and use the offer code TWIG-T-W-I-G.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.560]   And now, at that $80 offer, suddenly $110, $55 in postage coupons, the free digital scale
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:05.960]   you just pay shipping and handling, $5 a black hit and four-week trial offer of Stamps.com.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.960]   You can get discounts.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.280]   You can't get it at the post office.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.360]   Post office wants you to use Stamps.com.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.240]   That's why they offer up to 21% off Express Mail, up to 15% off Priority Mail when you
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.720]   use Stamps.com.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.280]   In fact, if you use it a lot, it can basically be free.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.520]   It's more professional.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   It's easier to use.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.440]   You'll never make another trip to the post office.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.000]   You just use Stamps.com and then the mail carrier comes and gets it.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.320]   You can even get a schedule free pickup.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.680]   The post office loves Stamps.com, so will you.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.960]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.400]   Stamps.com offer code TWIG.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.960]   It says $55 offer on our page right there on the front.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   That's wrong too.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   It's $110.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.880]   $110 bonus offer.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:51.960]   You see offer code TWIG, Stamps.com.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.320]   Did you find the story?
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.960]   Yes, under privacy, it's the last one.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.760]   Add networks bypass.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.560]   Now, we should qualify this.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.160]   The one who's bringing up on TWIG is because you and I have both been very critical of
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:12.520]   the journal for their privacy stories saying they often are a crying wolf.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:18.440]   In this case, Jessica Vasquez, Ressarello and Joel Sheckman writing that mobile ad networks
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:24.520]   are doing something similar to what Google did to target iPhone users by circumventing
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.640]   Apple's privacy protections.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:35.400]   Apple said after the Google brew-ha-ha that it wouldn't allow app makers to use the unique
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.200]   ID and phones and pads to track users.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.680]   Add networks to serve advertisements within mobile apps started using new unique identifiers,
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   cookies in effect that collect information like location and preferences as the user
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.120]   moves across apps.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.200]   This isn't with iads.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.320]   This is with other ad networks.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.040]   iads hasn't really gotten much traction.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.480]   There are a lot of other ad networks on the iPhone.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.440]   The networks, now this is the argument that we were having about tracking.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:12.880]   The networks claim it will cost millions of dollars a week in lost revenue if they can't
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.200]   target you.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.240]   Personal data is needed.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:25.960]   Mazda, Nikon and E-Harmony according to the Wall Street Journal are all employing tracking
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.080]   systems in their ads.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.480]   The brands aren't doing it directly but they don't even know about it because they're using
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.480]   ad agencies and these ad platforms.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.880]   The ad platforms aren't doing it.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.800]   In fact, the journal talked to Mazda and the director of digital marketing said she wasn't
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.200]   aware that ad networks were doing this.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.720]   But she said, "Hey, if this becomes more widely adopted, we would like to use the anonymous
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.680]   identifiers to target customers with campaigns based on geography and lifestyle.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.440]   The advertisers would love this."
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:03.920]   The issue is that mobile Safari, by default, only accepts cookies from the site that you
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.920]   visited.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.520]   If I go to twit.tv, I'll make you quit that.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.480]   And that's what Google ended around.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   Right.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.840]   Google and these ad networks are working around that because they want their pages.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.320]   They want users to be able to accept cookies from say double click or some ad network.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.680]   Which would then allow them to track.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.400]   What double click would do is every time you went to a site with a double click ad, it
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.880]   would say, "Who are you?
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   Where are you?
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   What are you doing?"
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   And aggregating that data.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   Right.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.520]   And by default, mobile Safari disallows that.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.200]   So now these ad networks want access to the UDID of the device.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.360]   Well, they're not allowed to.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.920]   Apple says no, so they're creating their own in effect.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.800]   Or they're using other IDs.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.280]   Yeah, let's be clear here.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.520]   Basically, there is no first site ad serving.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.720]   Everyone uses third part of your ad serving either because it is a lot more efficient
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.400]   and inexpensive to use a double click or such.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.880]   Or because the ad agencies and other clients insist upon it, as I've said in the show before,
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.960]   the GM was the first GM and Proctor and Gamble, the first two gigantic advertisers to insist
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.000]   on serving their own ad so they could verify what they had.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.440]   So this idea that, "Oh my God, they're setting to third party," well, that's always been
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.360]   the case and will be the case when it comes to advertising.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:22.320]   And if that were to turn around, then you're putting a huge burden onto sites.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.720]   Ad serving is expensive and it's difficult.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.880]   I know because we used to run on.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   So is ad sales.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.960]   You don't want to do any of that.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.720]   You want a third party to do that.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.600]   So it's not, you know, that's become, it's like the word tracking is demonized.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.280]   So it's third parties.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.280]   We have three people here.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.360]   One of us is a third party.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.200]   Well, to you, both of us are third parties.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   Wow.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.200]   Wow.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   You see.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.040]   And I see you, you're watching me.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.040]   I can see it.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.040]   You're tracking me.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.040]   Sorry.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   But okay.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.120]   So for the sake of argument though, you see the three of us, right?
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.760]   But for people don't understand how the web works.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.240]   And I agree that this is a standard way that web works.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:05.120]   If you visit a site with .tv, you know, as a user, you see to it.tv in the URL bar,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.160]   you expect this is an interaction that you're having with Twitter.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.160]   With only Twitter, right.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:14.960]   No, no, generally when you load a page, when you load a page and you look at the load,
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.240]   don't you see everything popping up there from sites all over, including by the way,
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.280]   you know, Facebook and Google Analytics and whatever.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.680]   And stamps.com or AdSans or whatever.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.680]   I mean, this is the thing.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:31.280]   I mean, I trust that Leo is going to do ads from companies that he's vetted and chosen
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.440]   to do business with them.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.240]   We don't do targeted advertising.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.320]   All our advertising is targeted by de facto because they assume that there's a tech audience,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.240]   but we don't know anything about our audience.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   Right.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.480]   You know what's funny is that, and maybe this would make people feel better if it were
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.720]   widely known.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.080]   The ad tracking people say we don't want to know people's names.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.640]   It's actually noise.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   That was in that story.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.880]   It was in one of the stories we have on the run on this week.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   It was fascinating.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.240]   Because it said that it's information we don't need.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.240]   It doesn't matter.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   Doesn't help us.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   We don't care what your name is.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.560]   We just want to know where you are, how much you make, what things you like.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.400]   Are you about to buy a car?
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:14.120]   Well, we want to know whether you've seen this same ad 10 times already.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:20.440]   Because we don't waste our money on you and be a disturb you.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:26.880]   You know, listen, I think that it would probably be a good thing for you.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.040]   Let's use this as an example in Twig.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:33.880]   If you had the capability to know whether I was an iPhone user or an Android user, that
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:41.640]   would allow you to serve up, let's say, app ads, these app ads, appropriate to the user.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.520]   And those ads would be less noisy to the user.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.640]   And that's what I think users need to understand is this actually improves their experience.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.560]   So nobody cares.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.760]   So these are the two things that if you really want to defend, first of all, you guys type
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.400]   using the word tracking cookies.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.840]   But if you really want to defend this process, you would say, hey, we don't care what your
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   name is.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   We don't care about your personal identity.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   It's noise.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.640]   We don't want it in the database.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.680]   And be all we're trying to do is make is nobody's going to believe this, but it's make your
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.040]   experience better.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.480]   We want to give you ads for products you're interested in.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.480]   Don't want to overdo it.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.800]   So I'm down with that.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.960]   I agree.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:29.520]   I think that, however, I do think that users should have the ability to turn that off if
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   they want.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.520]   I don't think that should be the default.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.000]   I think I've come to the place where I think that Apple's being too restrictive, making
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   that the default setting.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.200]   Get ready because Microsoft has announced that Do Not Track is going to be the default
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   in IE 10.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.920]   Oh, it's going to be on by default.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.320]   On by default.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   No.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:53.080]   Most of our users don't use IE, but it's still by far the majority browser.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   I think out there.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.480]   That's a big deal.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.320]   I'm not sure if it still is, but it's still obviously huge.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.320]   It's big.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:04.840]   And it doesn't affect Microsoft's business, but it does affect media's business badly.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.960]   Google doesn't even have Do Not Track in Chrome because it understands how important this
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   is.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.440]   Google's an ad network, basically.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.440]   Microsoft is not.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.440]   They're an advertiser company.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.480]   And I think Microsoft says, hey, we could stick it to Google and Facebook.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.640]   Well, that's what you see is you see companies that are not dependent upon advertising or
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.280]   are de-emphasizing advertising.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:26.520]   And that's I throw newscorp into that because it is a paid content company now.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.400]   And Microsoft sells other things, other products.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.440]   And by the way, consumers are going to love this.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.680]   This is going to sell Windows 8.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   It's going to sell IE 10.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.280]   The fact that Do Not Track is on?
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   Yes.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:45.160]   That's why people were so upset at Google because Do Not Track was on mobile Safari.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.120]   And Google said, well, we can't do likes.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.960]   We can't do pluses.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.360]   So we have to get around this.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   That was the thing that upset people is that Google was bypassing Do Not Track.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:01.040]   But you're saying that Microsoft is going to sell IE 10.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.520]   I think this is a security feature, right?
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   Absolutely.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.200]   Why else would they make a big announcement?
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   Right.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.200]   Right.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.200]   Yep.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.680]   And it just, I think it's fun.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.640]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.040]   You know, Gina, I want to come back and agree with you on one thing.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.640]   Absolutely true that users should have a choice.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   I agree.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.600]   Well, that we screwed it up in my industries, right?
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.880]   In media advertising and technology, we were not clear.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.800]   It enabled the demonization.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.640]   It's there because people don't know, and that's stupid.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.600]   It's just downright stupid.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.560]   And it's probably damaged that these industries will never recover from.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:46.520]   But I go to media companies now and I see what goes on with advertising pictures and
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:51.720]   they need, they have to be going more toward knowing signals about you if they're going
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.880]   to survive.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.120]   I think it also distracts from other more important privacy concerns.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   That's the problem.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:06.160]   Just get all head up about these issues, then you don't pay attention to say, for instance,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:13.320]   there is a very rapid mass movement towards electronic health care, electronic patient
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.840]   records.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.680]   And just read a very good article that said, "One of the issues with a lot of the laws
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.160]   of state surpassing right now is it's all or nothing."
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.320]   You can say, "I don't want to have my health record shared."
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:29.680]   What you can't say is, "I want relevant information, share, but not irrelevant information."
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:35.560]   The example he used was, let's say you had a venereal disease, actually he didn't use
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.560]   this, but I'll use this.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.640]   You had a venereal disease 10 years ago, and you're going to a podiatrist because you want
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.320]   a bunion removed.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.720]   The podiatrist says, "Well, can I see your health records?"
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.280]   In many states, you will only have the option of yes or no.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   You won't say, "Yeah, but you can't see the venereal disease that I had.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.520]   You cannot control it."
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:59.200]   And this is a big issue, a big privacy issue that is completely ignored because we're all
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.000]   worried about tracking cookies.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.280]   Leo, hold on, hold on.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.760]   I go to a big medical group.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.960]   Everybody has my full record there.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.080]   They don't give me the right to go in and say, "I'll show this to that doctor and that
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.840]   doctor," because it would be insanely difficult for them.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:20.880]   And his doc, Searles, has pointed out when he had a bad choice that he and his doctor
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.600]   made when a health problem he had a couple years ago, not having electronic access to
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.440]   your full file is probably far more dangerous than somebody knowing you have hurt me.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.080]   In fact, that's what the Director of Health and Human Services just said is, "You're 600
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:40.000]   percent more times, six times more likely to have mistreatment if you don't share this information."
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.080]   And then there's an issue to society.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:48.280]   I spoke by a conference call lunch session with a bunch of people at the CDC about two
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.800]   weeks ago because of public parts.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:59.840]   And what they're doing is seeing the benefit of shared data at scale and how that can lead
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:11.040]   to speedy monitoring of spreading diseases, correlations, maybe causation.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.920]   And so they're asking, "How do we get around this?"
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.840]   Now, one problem they have is they have a department that's all about surveillance.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   And I said, "Can you please get rid of that word?
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   Health surveillance?
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.640]   That's freaking big, wow."
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.080]   You think track heat is bad?
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:29.560]   You guys talking about surveilling my health.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:33.160]   Well, but you're Mr. Open Privacy Advocate.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.760]   So you're saying that health records should just, if they're shared, they should be shared
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   on a percent.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.760]   No, I'm saying a few things.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.120]   I'm saying that we have to have a conversation.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.800]   The start point is that we're ignoring something that's very important for privacy issues.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.400]   I'm just using, pick that out of the air as an example.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.360]   No, no, no, it's right.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.640]   And part of that discussion has to be the balance of fear and benefit.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.760]   And that there are benefits to you individually to have all of your health data together.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.440]   There are benefits to you as a member of society and your neighbors to know that there's
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:10.520]   a outbreak of whatever disease or breast cancer or prostate cancer in your neighborhood and
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.800]   it's in the water.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.520]   Those are benefits that we need to discuss too.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:21.160]   And I would argue that no one should be forced out of any health closet ever.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:27.440]   But there are reasons, there are good and sane and rational reasons to share.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.880]   And that's where I want to be part of the conversation.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.840]   But the discussion always starts with, "Oh my God, health."
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:39.040]   And my other point is, why in this day and age should anyone be ashamed of being sick?
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.440]   It's not like the black plague.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.440]   Well, that's true.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.440]   You saw a boy.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.440]   What if...
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.040]   The author used was a rape.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:55.080]   Yes, but I also have seen cases of a very famous editor who did this who, again, forced
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:59.720]   no one out of their closet of confidentiality but who said it's time to take the shame off
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.720]   that.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.720]   Well, I agree.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.720]   But...
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.560]   Oh, I mean, you know, there's HIV, which means a lot of people assume that you're a drug
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.760]   user or that you're gay.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   You know, I mean, there's...
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.320]   But yeah, I agree that this shouldn't be an issue and it's getting better, right?
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.920]   I'm not so sure.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:21.240]   No, me, Mr. Optumus, all the time, no, I think we're shutting down more because of this
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.000]   kind of fear, because of this change that it brings.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.480]   And so that's why I wrote an old damn book.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.080]   But I don't know, Gina.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.920]   I mean, we were opening it up in some ways.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.920]   But we're...
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.840]   And we had this great conversation a few months ago about what you would tell your grandmother
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:43.080]   between 40 years ago versus today, which I think was a very personal way to look at
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.440]   this, that the society has obviously changed around it with us and because of us.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.360]   But still, I'm a little worried these days.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.600]   I did, however, delete my LinkedIn account today.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.440]   Well, A, I don't need it.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.960]   And B, I don't want my calendar information shared with LinkedIn, which apparently they've
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.720]   been doing, similar to what Path was doing with the address book information, except
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.000]   that I think the calendar information could even be more...
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.520]   I mean, if you're a CEO and you've got private...
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.520]   I mean, there's all sorts of stuff in there, right?
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:17.440]   So this is if you had the LinkedIn app installed on your phone, it would upload your calendar
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.440]   data from you?
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.640]   And LinkedIn said, "Well, we did that because we want to see if you're meeting with somebody
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.960]   else so we know we could give you that kind of information."
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.640]   But they didn't tell anybody they were doing this, they didn't warn anybody that they
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.240]   were saving it, that was being saved on the servers.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.080]   It's just like Path.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.480]   It's another one of them.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   Okay.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:41.800]   And then 65.4 million LinkedIn passwords were leaked, including mine.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.800]   I went and checked.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.200]   No, I was ahead of us.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.120]   That's Gina's tip.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   But...
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.120]   Okay.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   Oh, yeah, that's okay.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.840]   I won't say anything, man.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:55.400]   Anyway, all I'm saying is I decided I don't think I'll be looking for work again.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   So...
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   So I hope not.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   This is interesting.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.880]   So when the path issue happened, Leo, you didn't think it was that big a deal, right?
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.400]   Because you would get an email occasionally saying, "Hey, your friend joined us."
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.800]   I didn't think it was big a deal because I understood that that's what they would have
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   to do to do it.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   You understood that's what they were doing.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.800]   Right.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.600]   But you didn't realize that LinkedIn was doing this.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.040]   There's no indication that they're sharing your calendar.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.000]   No, I don't use the LinkedIn iOS app.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.440]   But if I were, I think it's kind of inappropriate to upload your calendar.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:25.120]   They're taking the calendar for the iOS calendar and uploading it.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.720]   Listen, I think that's crazy, but I didn't like what Path is doing either.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.920]   But this is the same conversation that we've been having.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:38.600]   At what point can you justify sharing data in the interest of a better experience?
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:42.040]   And I have a hard time with, I have a hard time with, let's be nice to the media companies
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.280]   and help them keep their business model.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.800]   I look at it more as like a user experience issue, right?
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.240]   If you can argue that it's a better user experience, then great.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.680]   People can make business models around that.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   And that's fine.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.680]   That's a good point.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.680]   That's a good point.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.440]   But this is kind of a similar situation, right?
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.080]   You're going to have a better experience on path and then why shouldn't it share your
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   address book?
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:03.040]   Or if you're going to have a better experience on LinkedIn setting up meetings or whatever
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:08.000]   people do on LinkedIn, why shouldn't they grab your calendar?
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.440]   Which I can't, it just seems absurd.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.520]   But where's the line?
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.520]   What's the line?
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.080]   I guess is really the question.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.120]   Anyway, and after the passwords get hacked, I thought, this is fine.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.520]   I don't need LinkedIn anymore.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.640]   Yeah, you know, LinkedIn has been around for so long.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.400]   My password for LinkedIn is one of my old passwords that I set up.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.200]   Like before I started using LastPass and more secure tools.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.400]   So yeah, we'll also--
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.440]   If you've been using the same password on other sites, you probably do want to--
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.440]   Yeah, you've got to go change them all.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.440]   Change them all.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.320]   So the Electronic Frontier Foundation has published a new, "Who's Got Your Back?"
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:48.160]   I love this.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.880]   I guess they do this on a regular basis.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:59:00.120]   They do a table of the grade internet companies on their privacy policies and their practices,
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.480]   particularly when the government comes and knocking.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.320]   And let me see if I can find-- because I think Twitter's pretty good.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.320]   Yeah, Twitter's--
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.520]   Three and a half gold stars out of four.
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.520]   That Twitter is done a lot of good stuff.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.520]   They're like, I think, very consciously--
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.520]   Yeah, I've got it here.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.720]   --it's got to be a little leader in this.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:24.160]   So the four categories are, when the government comes a column, will the company tell users
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:28.640]   about the data demands, be transparent about government requests, fight for user privacy
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.280]   in the courts, fight for user privacy in Congress?
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.760]   There aren't very many people that will tell you that the government's asking.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:36.760]   I think in some cases--
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.280]   Well, but some things they're allowed to--
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   They're not allowed to.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.800]   I think they say that they're going to tell you.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.800]   Who gets--
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:44.800]   Who gets--
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.800]   Can't say.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   --2 half stars and two full stars.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:51.720]   They tend one blank star on fight for user privacy in the courts.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:56.880]   SonicNet, which is our local internet service provider here, four stars.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.880]   They do it all, baby.
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:58.880]   I like some of it.
[00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.880]   Very nice.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:01.880]   That's Dane Jasper.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.880]   We've had him on before.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.880]   Great guy.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.880]   And he really cares about this stuff.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.920]   He's got a political ax to grind.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   Twitter's pretty good.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.560]   Three and a half stars.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.280]   Verizon zero stars.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.760]   Skype zero stars.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.520]   MySpace zero stars.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   Four square.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.520]   Oh, Dan's zero stars.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520]   Oh.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.400]   That means four square neither tells you that the government asked.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.480]   Is transparent about it, fights for you, or goes to Congress or anything.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   They just--
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.280]   I'm going to bet that's a case of small company.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   Start up.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   Yeah, because I know Dan's cares about that stuff.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280]   He's great.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.280]   I'm going to be there tomorrow for a meeting.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.280]   I'll ask him.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   Ask him.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.360]   EFF.org/pages/who-has-dash, you're dash back.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.920]   Dash dash.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   Google did pretty well here.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920]   They're kind of right.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   Google did all right.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.920]   Yeah, they did all right.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.880]   I think a big company, very few companies can go to Congress, can fight for user privacy
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.880]   in Congress.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.760]   In fact, I'm surprised at the number of companies that do have stars in that column.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.160]   The easy thing would be to tell users about data demands.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.280]   And as you say, Jeff, in some cases they're not allowed.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:10.440]   Patriot Act, for instance, disallows-- if a grocery store gets a Patriot Act request
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.200]   for who buys hummus, they can't tell anybody.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.000]   It's a secret.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.760]   Let's see.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.840]   Google told by the EC to pay, play ball, or face a trial.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.760]   I just do these EC stories to see him.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.760]   Just to get me going.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   See him steam.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.880]   Google's been given an ultimatum by the European Commission.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.600]   Straighten up, or we'll take you to court.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   That's good.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.360]   I'm not going to do this to you.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.040]   Who cares?
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.880]   I think we might see at Google I/O a Google set-top box that will play movie streams from
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.600]   Android phones and tablets.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600]   That's interesting.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.600]   Yeah, that seems like an obvious next time.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   The kind of airplay.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600]   So you install an app on your Android device and you're watching a video or listening music
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   and you send it to your Google TV?
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.800]   Computer show that's going on or just just ended, I guess.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:20.760]   They showed a new Google TV box with Android 4, a Marvell dual core ARM A9 processor, four
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:27.240]   gigs of flash memory, one gig of RAM, ports from microSD, ethernet and HDMI video.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.640]   Wow.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.480]   This is from a company called Honey Wild Honey Well Honey Well.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.360]   Honey Well.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.440]   The Honey Well?
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.080]   No, Honey Wild.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.080]   H-O-N-E-Y-W-L-D.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.360]   Sounds like a port company.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   Honey Well.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   Honey Well.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.680]   Honey Wild Honey Well.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.080]   Between 95 and 120 bucks.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.080]   That would be a cool product.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.080]   Yeah, that's cheap.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.040]   It's for the Taiwanese market, unfortunately.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040]   You know, I could do that.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.080]   It's one of the things I like about DLNA, which is basically what airplay is.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.000]   Airplay is Apple's branded DLNA.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.840]   That's the same standard.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.480]   Many TVs and other devices can see DLNA.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.080]   That's how I can play music from my Galaxy S3 or video.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.600]   A lot of phones now have DLNA.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.120]   Android especially.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.320]   Well, iPhone's done.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320]   Google bought QuickOffice.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.920]   What do you think about that?
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.760]   Did they really need it or is that a Trojan horse into iOS devices?
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:33.200]   QuickOffice for those who don't know is an iOS app that lets you open office apps from
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   iOS.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.880]   They've been around for a long.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.880]   I remember having QuickOffice.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.800]   I think I'm blank, Barry.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   They've been around for a long time.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.280]   Google says it has to do with Google Apps.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.960]   Today consumers, businesses and schools use Google Apps to get stuff done from anywhere
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.600]   with anyone on any device.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   QuickOffice.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.320]   Well, I guess they want.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.960]   I mean, QuickOffice experience in iOS.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.800]   I mean, the Google Apps experience in iOS is not very good.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.880]   Right now, QuickOffice is for Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.840]   It does let those files run on Android and iOS devices.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.880]   So this could be good.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.280]   It also acquired Mibo.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.680]   What was having heard Mibo in like seven years?
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.640]   I was like, wait, is that that chat thing?
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   Who uses Mibo?
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   Who uses Mibo?
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   Did it change though?
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   Did it pivot?
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   It did.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   Social platform.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.960]   It began as browser-based instant messaging client.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.480]   Then they had the Mibo bar, which allows you to chat on TV guide, TMZ, Entertainment Weekly.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.200]   Now the website will team up with a search engine giant for future unidentified adventures.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.480]   That's PC Magazine.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.800]   Stephanie, meot running in PC Magazine.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.120]   Future unidentified adventures.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.880]   Together, Mibo said, together with Google, we're super jazzed to roll up our sleeves
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:00.400]   and get cracking on even bigger and better ways to help users and website owners alike.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]   Super jazzed.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.400]   I'm super jazzed.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.400]   Okay.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.240]   They said the alleged asking price was $100 million.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.880]   I am in the wrong business.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.720]   What am I doing?
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:15.600]   I should have started a web-based IM platform.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.840]   Multi-user chat rooms.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.720]   What do you think?
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:30.000]   What are the bets that we will get Google glasses under our chairs at IO?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   I don't know.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.240]   It keeps seeing reports and videos.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.600]   There's a video, somebody wearing that.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.840]   I think what will happen is that you might be the first people to actually be able to
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.640]   put them on in a booth somewhere.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.640]   Oh, all right.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.720]   Yeah, you're probably right.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.800]   That's worth it.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   That's worth it.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.400]   That'd be good.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:56.560]   Um, Twitter says we're going to have a billion dollars in ad revenue next year after next.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.560]   That surprised the heck out of me.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.000]   Not this year, not next year, the year after 2014.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   But they even have what?
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.480]   525 now surprised me, which I guess is a good thing.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.440]   What ads they have are unobtrusive.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.400]   I don't know how they got half a billion in revenue from what they're doing.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.120]   It was $139.5 million last year.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.080]   This year they said $540 million.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.520]   This is just from promoted tweets and promoted users.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   That's...
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.200]   I mean, how else are they advertising?
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.440]   Yeah, and maybe advertising in search results.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.440]   Huh.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.440]   That's right.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.880]   I got to Twitter a lot to search.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.560]   We had a power outage in my area.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.800]   First thing, first place I went.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.800]   It's what I do now.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800]   It's just what you do.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.480]   I mean, you just expect that, you know, the local news, you know, is going to be reporting
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   the tweets later.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   Right.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   We're just looking for tweets.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.480]   Go to the source.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.080]   You original tweets.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:57.160]   Um, and I use it like on Sunday, the Twitter video feed didn't go.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.480]   It was messed up.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.560]   And somebody told me that.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.600]   So I went to Twitter to see if it was true.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   I'm not kidding.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   I'm not kidding.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600]   Tweers.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.080]   I'm going to jump ahead.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.080]   This is probably gone anyway.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.080]   We're going to wrap.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.480]   No, no, there were some Pew numbers out a week ago, right after our show.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.200]   And what's interesting is that the acceptance, the adoption of Twitter, has not gone up that
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.320]   much, but the engagement with it has, which they...
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.520]   Pew is guessing it comes from mobile.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:31.720]   So in November 2010, 8% of online adults use Twitter.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.200]   2% used it daily.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.600]   All right.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:41.360]   In May 2011, 13% used Twitter 4% daily.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.760]   Now jumping ahead to now, 15% used it Twitter at all.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.240]   8% daily.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:52.960]   So it's still a pretty small adoption to be able to be something valuable for, you know,
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.440]   that kind of news of having enough people around you that when the power is out, there's
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.760]   going to be somebody else who's on Twitter who knows about it who's saying something.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.960]   Well, it's kind of interesting because it sounds like you don't need a critical mass
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   to make this valuable.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   It's the one 9% and 100% rule, right?
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:18.240]   1% of people in social situations are extremely active, 10% somewhat active, and 90% lurk.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.800]   And you only need 1%.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.800]   I mean, it's Clay Shurkey's rule about Wikipedia.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.000]   Less than 2% of the users we can make Wikipedia.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.240]   And if you double that, it'd be chaos.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.760]   Hmm.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:36.800]   By the way, I can tweet from my galaxy S3 by voice, which I cannot do with Siri.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.800]   Oh, I could say, I could say Twitter.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   Oops, I just did.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:49.720]   Oh, the voice is not nearly as nice.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.880]   Well, you have a choice.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.280]   They have a Samsung voice and this is a Google voice.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.120]   Please repeat your request.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:00.080]   Twitter, is it time for me to talk?
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.160]   Twitter update.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.600]   I'm tweeting from my galaxy S3 phone period.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   Wow.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.680]   You must log into Twitter to update the status.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.080]   Well, in password.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.960]   I thought I did.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.440]   I already did.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.240]   Anyway, that's by the way, that's the thing that Apple is suing over.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.080]   They say that that's too much like Siri.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.640]   It's actually much better than-- I'm sorry, didn't mean to offend you.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.240]   It's actually much better than Siri.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.600]   You could set alarms, weather, turn Wi-Fi on, tweet.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.000]   You could say how high is Mount Everest.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.600]   You can play music as you saw, set tasks.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.600]   You can do memos.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.280]   You can navigate.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280]   Look up context.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.200]   I could say look up-- let's try it.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.600]   Look up Gina Trappani.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.960]   I found Gina Trappani in the word draft book.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   I love it.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.960]   Gina Trappani.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.480]   She doesn't know how to say your name.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.080]   She says it like I do.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.920]   Trappani, I found Gina Trappani in your address book.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.280]   Yeah, Apple invented this.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.680]   I don't know how Samsung could possibly do this.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.760]   Apple, get off it.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.600]   Just make a better phone, please.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.520]   Sean, you see Sean Parker and Sean Fanning's airtime launch yesterday?
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.760]   You get it?
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.000]   I didn't see the launch, but it sounded like I should have missed it.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   Nightmare.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.200]   Yeah, it was like horrible, wonderful, wonderfully horrible.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:37.160]   Well, they had Julia, Louis, Dreyfus, Jim Carrey, Snoop Dogg, Jimmy Fallon.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   So, you know, I mean, this is Sean--
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.920]   I was never showing off your roll-a-dex, yeah.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.080]   This is Sean Parker going.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.480]   I know the big guy.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.320]   And unfortunately, nothing worked.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.000]   So these guys were like-- apparently, Julia Louis Dreyfus was not having.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:01.880]   At one point, they had-- what's her name?
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.680]   Saying no, really, it worked much better.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.600]   Olivia Mon.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.560]   Olivia Mon.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.560]   And really, it worked much better.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.960]   It was video froze.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.840]   This is not how it's supposed to be.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.440]   Anyway, I don't get it.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.440]   It's Shatler, we're like without penises, right?
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.800]   But how do they assure that?
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.320]   Well, this is an interesting thing.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.400]   I mean, apparently, they're taking screenshots.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.960]   They're doing all sorts of stuff.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.720]   I'm not too moved to use it.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:33.520]   It looks-- what it does is it's a side-by-side video,
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.440]   and it uses your social graph to say, hey, what do you like?
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.680]   Talk to Jeff Jarvis?
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.200]   I don't want to talk to random people out of my social graph,
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.080]   just for no reason.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:41.880]   No, either.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.760]   I don't either.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.280]   Well, you know, I don't want to do it randomly.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.240]   I do go on to Google+ once in a rare while,
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.000]   and I just decide to go on a hangout and see who shows up.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.080]   But then we know who we're talking to.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:53.760]   Right.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.080]   To have them assigned.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.760]   It's the same as when I wrote a couple years ago
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.640]   about the notion of a social airline.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.800]   But now it's a social airline.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.200]   Well, the idea is that you could sit next to who you want to,
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.040]   and you could do other things.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:12.640]   And so KLM and another company here with AirBoltik
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.360]   just-- they sent me a press release--
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.240]   just set this up so that the airline, AirBoltik,
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:23.040]   will find you at a compatible person to sit next to.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:23.760]   Well, no, I want somebody--
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.800]   That's interesting.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.640]   I want the opposite.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.320]   I want somebody who doesn't want to talk to me,
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.360]   and I don't want to talk to them.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.640]   What I really want is if I'm going to South by Southwest
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.400]   together, then let's find out who else I know
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.160]   was on the flight, and then give us the option
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.040]   to sit next to get it.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.120]   Now, that would be cool.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.120]   For South Bayah, it would be.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.880]   But most flights are so random, there's not going to be anybody.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.920]   So random, you don't want it.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.080]   So this idea of giving me somebody random--
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.600]   No, because then I'd have to talk to them.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.120]   Yes.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.000]   You don't know for that.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.360]   I don't want to talk to anybody.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.240]   That's why you're a type of cynic, cynic, cynic.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.960]   I thought I would want to be a ham,
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.440]   so I passed all the tests, got all the equipment,
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.400]   and then I realized, no, I talk all day.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.240]   I want to go home and shut up.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.640]   Well, Ms. Hardaway just came in and said,
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.080]   you can choose who to talk to.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.040]   It's like a pretty Skype.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.240]   A pretty Skype.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.120]   Well, I thought it served you--
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:11.840]   Oh, no, it doesn't.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.840]   No, it's not random, but you have a list of people
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.720]   you might want to call, I guess.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.400]   Oh, I saw--
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.160]   Well, I don't know.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.600]   Sarah used it, and did you choose that person, Sarah,
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.840]   or did you just pop up?
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.880]   She's not there.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.720]   I got the impression it just popped up.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.800]   It's a mix.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.520]   So you can see your friends that you have printed,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.000]   and you could give them a call, or you can just say,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   using my social graph, find someone who's interesting.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.960]   So you get to give me somebody random, or, hey, let's talk
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:40.840]   to Jeff.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.720]   I mean, Skype does-- let's talk to Jeff's thing.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.960]   I don't know.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.320]   I guess you could go like this with Skype.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:46.800]   Mm-hmm.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.040]   Minnie, minnie, minnie, moe.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:48.520]   Boom.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.040]   And the call.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.480]   Well, I did something today's go.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.480]   I saw these two people I know from Northwestern's
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.360]   middle school journalism, and they just
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.800]   did obviously a public hangout.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.560]   I could tell, because it was labeled "medil hangout."
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.080]   Right.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:13:59.920]   But I said, what the hell?
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:00.800]   They just did it publicly.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.320]   So they were just starting up.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.080]   So I click in.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.040]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.840]   That's a nervous-- what are you doing here, right?
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.200]   And I said, what's one thought I'd say hello and all that?
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.680]   And they said, well, it's a faculty being.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.760]   It's all going to run away as fast from that as possible.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.280]   By the way, that was Chad Johnson, the old redhead,
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.840]   our new producer on the show, who is just dino-mite.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.440]   Dino-mite.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.280]   It seems like airtime is tackling kind of the same problem
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.560]   we're trying to create the same experience
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.560]   of Google+ hangouts.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.060]   Right.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:29.560]   It is.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.060]   Exactly.
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:30.560]   Right.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.920]   And I just figured out that I'm just too old for hangouts.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.720]   I think hangouts are really useful.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.560]   Hangouts are cool.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.120]   Young people who are a lot more outgoing than I am.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.240]   And I think probably airtime is a similar thing.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.960]   But it seems like just maybe a little bit
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.200]   of a different approach.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.280]   Certainly, we've had so many video chat products come out
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.520]   in the past couple of years, right?
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.640]   FaceTime and hangouts and now airtime.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.840]   I wasn't that like, oh, I have to have that.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.400]   But it just seems like it's this problem
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.640]   that different companies are trying to solve in different ways.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.280]   How can I chat with someone?
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.440]   If it weren't Sean Parker and Sean Fanning,
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440]   I don't think they would have gotten any attention at all.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.320]   Oh, well, that's clear.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.760]   I mean, deep pockets, big names.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.840]   You're going to have a launch like that.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.200]   We're going to take a break.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:10.880]   Come back with our--
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.400]   Leo, Leo, can I do a favor?
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.960]   Can I give you a number and then--
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.520]   Yes.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.440]   Because we got to-- you got a plane to catch.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.280]   I got a plane to catch someone.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.040]   So we'll do Gina's tip in my tool, but Jeff's number.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:21.640]   Thank you.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.560]   So a different one.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.360]   So there's this-- there's this--
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.000]   I go in now, I'm trying to make it happen to go
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.280]   into Kickstarter and find new stuff.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.960]   And I found this great little thing that happens
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.760]   to be called the Twig.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.320]   And the Twig is a really nice, bendable USB charging
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.560]   cable for your iPhone.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.160]   I presume I've had to.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.200]   And it's really nice.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.040]   And so I contributed to it.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.680]   And they're now a double--
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.440]   their goal of $50,000, $50 days to go.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.760]   And so I thought I'd just give them--
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.680]   since the name is serendipitous, if we don't want to sue them.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.720]   No, I love it.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.600]   That's not a problem.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.120]   It's a neat little device.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.880]   So if you scroll down, you see all the uses for it.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.240]   What I like is not having a wire in my briefcase.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.960]   But I can use a connector that's not a wire.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.080]   Now, you understand that they better hurry
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.240]   because apparently Apple is eliminating the 30-pin port
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.920]   on the iPhone.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.760]   They're going to a micro-USB port from what the rumor
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.080]   email seems to indicate.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.200]   Which is not a bad thing, OI.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.160]   So there's still time, 50 days to go.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.800]   They've already got 100,000 of their 50,000 goal.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.040]   It's a shorter bendy.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   It's a bit and use it as a--
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.160]   if you scroll down.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.320]   It's a gumbee.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.240]   Well, that's the inspiration.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.880]   It's a gumbee for the iPhone.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.360]   Oh, look.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.400]   And it can be a tripod.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.480]   It can be a tripod.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.520]   It can be a--
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.240]   That's very cool.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.560]   That's neat.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.480]   I love this.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.240]   Isn't this cool?
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.200]   Now, they have to license the 30-pin port, you understand?
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.200]   I guess that's probably where most of the money's going to go.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:57.840]   A bet.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.280]   A bet.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.440]   So I thought it was cool.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:16:59.920]   It's neat.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.360]   Given the name, coincidence, I thought I'd give them a little bit.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.360]   It's neat.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:03.880]   There you go.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.280]   And it's a cord wrap, too.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.120]   It's a cord wrap, yeah.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.120]   That is clever.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.800]   And it's a pocket protector.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.200]   This does everything.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:14.800]   It does.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.480]   It solves the world's problems.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.280]   It's twig.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.120]   Wow.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.200]   It's amazing how Kickstarter's being on this market
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.000]   for iPhone accessories.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:24.680]   That's great.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.640]   Yeah, this is really cool.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.080]   Amazing, ultra-portable cable for your iPhone.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.760]   If you search for Kickstarter and twig,
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.520]   you'll find it pretty quickly.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.440]   Good.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:33.840]   I like it.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.360]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:34.840]   Sorry, I'm going to do that.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.320]   Safe travels.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.480]   We'll see you back in the US of A.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:38.200]   Safe flight, Jeff.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.240]   I'll see you in Washington next week.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.280]   From DC.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.160]   He's a traveling fool.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:42.640]   How are you fool?
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.080]   Is that--
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:43.440]   All right.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.440]   Take care, Jeff.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.000]   We're going to have more.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.040]   We get Gina's a tip in my tool of the week,
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.560]   but first a word from Squarespace.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.360]   This should be my tool.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.760]   I love Squarespace.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.600]   The secret behind exceptional websites,
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.760]   everything you need to make a wonderful website,
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.520]   including, of course, the best hosting in the business.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.320]   There is none better than Squarespace
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.800]   and the best content management system.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.520]   So you get great software on top of a great hosting platform,
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.120]   always secure, always up to date,
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.160]   because they take care of that.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:09.720]   You don't have to.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.040]   It's fully managed.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.320]   You focus on what you want to do, which really
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.360]   is the content, I presume.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.800]   This is not a good site if you want
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.640]   to hack around with Apache.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.240]   Mess around with .htaccess.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.640]   Upload fixes and patches to your software.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.200]   This is for people who want to post content.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.000]   And whether it's a photo galleries for the photographer,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.920]   importing from your existing blog, mobile type, WordPress
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.680]   Type Hat, or Blogger, using the iOS or Android apps
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.640]   for editing and creating content and moderating comments,
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.200]   it's got everything you need.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:44.960]   You're going to love it.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.120]   Take a look at the example sites.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:46.920]   Take a tour.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.640]   They even have great free workshops for Squarespace
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:54.600]   customers at workshops.squarespace.com.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.480]   I don't think there is a better platform
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.920]   for creating your new website than Squarespace.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.560]   I want you to visit it right now.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.320]   And try it for you.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.600]   You don't even need to use the offer code.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.680]   Just click the try it free button.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.440]   You've got two weeks of Squarespace.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.320]   If you decide you want to buy, that's
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.840]   when you want to use the offer code, twig six.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.960]   And do note, somebody said your offer code's no good,
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.400]   because they were listening to an old show.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.360]   It updates every month.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.360]   This is June, so it's the sixth month.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.400]   So twig TWIG six.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.120]   So always use the current month and twig in the number.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.680]   Now what is the offer this time?
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:32.120]   Well, I'll tell you, 10% off your first purchase on new accounts.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.960]   So get the yearly plan, because that's
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.760]   going to be the most savings.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.760]   And in fact, by the way, the new pricing is very affordable.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.360]   Websites are as low as $8 a month.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.280]   And if you want the unlimited plan, which really is amazing
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.240]   deal, unlimited pages, bandwidth, storage, and with either--
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.400]   it's $16 a month.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:55.080]   And with either plan, when you buy the annual plan,
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.840]   you get a free custom domain.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.280]   So you can have your own domain.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.280]   They'll hook it up, so it's automatic.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.560]   And use the offer code twig six.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.800]   You're going to take 10% off.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.360]   Now that's a great deal.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.520]   The Google Web Font Library, 300 fonts, fully integrated.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.880]   24/7, support from a really good support team.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.480]   Widgets for Twitter and Flickr and Facebook and on and on.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.520]   And Google Maps, on and on and on.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.680]   I want you to try it free.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.720]   Go to squarespace.com, click the try and free button.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.040]   Just remember, when you sign up, use twig six as the offer code.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.320]   And you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:33.240]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:36.320]   Well, LinkedIn had a password leak this week.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.600]   So you should be auditing your passwords.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.240]   You should change your LinkedIn password.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.040]   You should make sure you're not using the same password
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:42.800]   everywhere.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.640]   You should use LastPass or KeyPass or some sort of secure
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.000]   password tool.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.680]   But if you're worried, if you haven't looked at LinkedIn
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.600]   in a while and maybe you're using an old password,
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.960]   if you want to know whether or not your password was
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.280]   in one of the leaked file, you can go to leakedin.org,
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.880]   which is actually kind of slow today because a lot of people
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.080]   are--
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:03.960]   It's busy.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.160]   Exactly, but leakedin.org.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.600]   If you enter your password on the page, normally,
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.840]   I would never tell you to enter your password on a random page.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.960]   But you're not entering your username.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.000]   Just your password.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.880]   And that page actually hashes the password on its sides.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.400]   You're not submitting your plain text password to the service.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.160]   All it does is check to see whether or not
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.000]   your password was leaked or not.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.400]   And mine wasn't.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.960]   So I got that great little message.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.320]   Looks like your password wasn't leaked.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.280]   Hooray.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:30.800]   Either way--
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.600]   Mine was, by the way.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.520]   Oh, yours was.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.920]   I know a lot of people whose password was leaked.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.120]   I know a lot of people who said, I signed up for LinkedIn
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.720]   forever ago, the same thing with me.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.680]   And I used an old password.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.240]   And back then, I used the same password for everything.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.800]   If your password was leaked and you're
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.960]   using a simple password and use that same password
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.080]   other places, go change your password everywhere
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.120]   and start using different secure passwords everywhere.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.240]   But leakedin.org, useful service, I think,
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.840]   programmer kind of threw that up real fast after the password
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.120]   leak.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:21:59.960]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.720]   That's what I'm not--
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.480]   And it's safe.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:01.960]   --of your info got out.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.480]   And it's safe.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.280]   We talked about it-- Steve Gibson-- I asked Steve Gibson
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.440]   about it, and he said, no, no.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.680]   The JavaScript is all local.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.800]   So they are--
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.360]   What they're doing is they're using the same hash technology,
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.120]   SHA1, on whatever you submit.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:13.960]   They're doing it locally.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.880]   So it never sends that password back to their servers.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.760]   And then you submit the resulting hash to their servers.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:23.480]   And they compare it with the database of leaked hashes.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.520]   And so unfortunately, I had a good random, long random
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.560]   password that I generated.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.320]   And so even though they had it, it's very unlikely
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.680]   they would have been able to hack my account.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.960]   They're only able to reverse the hashes on kind of crappy,
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.960]   obvious passwords.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.880]   All right, weak passwords.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.000]   What are you using now, Leo?
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.960]   Do you use LastPass or--
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.480]   LastPass.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:40.480]   LastPass.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.480]   LastPass.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.280]   Yeah, me too.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.320]   And so what I did, just in case, is I used LastPass
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:48.880]   to generate a new password and use that for LinkedIn.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.600]   And then I canceled my account.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.320]   That's the same price you signed here.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320]   And then I thought about it.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.840]   And I said, I don't need this anymore.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.600]   Bye-bye.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.720]   So I guess I've already done my tool.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.400]   I guess there's really no reason to go into any more detail.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.520]   I have really think this is a fantastic phone.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.960]   The speed, battery life is good.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.840]   Cameras, superb.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.880]   This is a nice implementation of ice cream sandwich.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.840]   Couldn't be happier.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.000]   I think that they've really done a nice job.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.320]   This is the Galaxy S3.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.600]   The good news is it's on every major carrier
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.240]   in the next month or so.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.840]   So if you want it, you can get it.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.560]   And I think this is--
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.840]   As long as Apple doesn't manage to get an injunction
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.560]   and keep it from coming into the US,
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.400]   I think this is going to be a very, very popular
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:39.900]   form.
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:45.000]   Phone pre-orders apparently were $9 million for this phone.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.240]   Its predecessor sold 50 million units, which I think is--
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.880]   We're talking iPhone territory here.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.320]   So this is a really spectacular phone.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.240]   Very thin, very light.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.560]   I don't have the same problems I had with the Nexus screen,
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.360]   which was a Pentile display as well.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.960]   But for some reason, the Galaxy Nexus,
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.040]   I just saw a lot of noise.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.920]   T-Mobile, AT&T Sprint, Verizon, all have it.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.560]   Apparently $199, which is surprising,
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.400]   because usually these premium phones go for $100 more.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:20.640]   June 21st for T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:24.920]   is taking pre-orders now, but won't be until July.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.560]   AT&T has not announced a date, but has said yes, we'll carry it.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.040]   In fact, I think they have a red one on AT&T.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.440]   That's for the 16 gig model.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.120]   And by the way, I think 16 gigs fine.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.760]   It takes an SD card.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.840]   I see no reason to get the 32 gig model.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:41.200]   I think 16 is plenty.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.880]   So buy it before it gets banned.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.360]   Someone in the chat room, I think, was MMX reminded,
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.560]   mentioned-- and this is a story I--
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.200]   we should probably mention real quick--
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:51.360]   onx.ms.
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.720]   Did you get a chance to look at this, Leo?
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.800]   No, what's that?
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:58.040]   It's a new Microsoft product for Android phones only, oddly
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:58.920]   enough.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.640]   But it's kind of an scripting automation tool for Android phone.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.960]   So it's similar to like Tasker for Android.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.160]   But it's a web app and an Android app.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.440]   And you get to create recipes for action.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.640]   I love it.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.000]   Given a set of variables.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.760]   So it's kind of like if that's than that, but for your phone.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.960]   So you say, if you're leaving work, text your spouse
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.320]   and say I'm on my way.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.400]   And is brand new, Microsoft just launched it, I think,
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:21.840]   this week.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.760]   It's in beta.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.240]   And all the recipes are it's onx.ms is the website.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.080]   And interestingly, just Android for now.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.400]   And I haven't had a chance, actually, to try this out myself.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.560]   But it looks like a nice UI on top of something like Tasker,
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.040]   which we've talked about before on the show.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.080]   For some reason, it wants a certificate.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.560]   Wow, this is using the JavaScript API.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.520]   Yeah, the recipes are JavaScript.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.080]   JavaScript.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.320]   So you can fork them and you can edit some.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.520]   Bizarre.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.840]   Yeah, I know.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.600]   What are you up to, Microsoft?
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.000]   What are you up to?
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:56.680]   I know.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.040]   I know.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.160]   I'll play with this.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.440]   Maybe we can make some little scripts.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.800]   I always like this kind of stuff.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.440]   Yeah, I do too, right?
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.520]   Because it's location.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.000]   And they detect the speed at which you're moving.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.680]   I assume it's speed and location, whether or not
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.360]   you're driving, running, or walking.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:19.320]   So as you can say, if I'm running, play my music.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.360]   If I'm driving--
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.400]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.560]   Send my text messages to--
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.440]   Increasingly, increasingly, these Android phones
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.800]   really are kind of amazing.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.960]   I have to say, the pace of innovation is fast.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:32.960]   And that's what's missing.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.160]   And the answer is, is the framework to do this kind of thing
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:35.660]   on?
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.480]   There are so many folks into the system that allow for this
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   kind of thing to happen.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.320]   It's wide open.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.440]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.120]   That's where she blogs.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.400]   You can also find her at thinkupapp.com,
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.560]   where she's writing the great think up app with the expert
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.440]   labs.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.240]   Jeff Jarvis is gone on a plane, but he, of course,
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.440]   is at buzzmachine.com.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.200]   And his book, Public Parts, is available in bookstores.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.160]   Everywhere we thank James Span for joining us, too.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.800]   Don't forget @Span on Twitter, two ends, SPA.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.840]   And if you want to follow Alabama tornado updates,
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.280]   or just follow his WeatherBrains podcast at WeatherBrains.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.120]   Come, thanks, Jeanette.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.480]   Great to have you.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.000]   Great to be on.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:13.760]   Great show again.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.040]   See you next week on This Week in Google.
