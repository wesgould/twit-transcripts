[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.680]   This week in Google, the show that covers Google and the cloud,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.640]   and coming down from her cloud, we're
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.680]   so happy to have Gina Trapana here, who was not feeling well
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.280]   for a long time.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.800]   I didn't know you were coughing last time.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.040]   Thank goodness for the mute button.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.200]   I'm coming down from my cloud of antibiotics.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   Get vaccinated, folks.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.720]   Get vaccinated.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   Seriously, I will calm cough on you.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.240]   Just get back to me.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.640]   You have whooping cough.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.480]   I have pertussis.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.640]   I have adult whooping cough, which is a cough without the whoop,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.400]   basically.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.040]   It's horrible.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.680]   And it's a lot of coughing and a lot of tissues.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   Most of us got a vaccination for it as kids,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920]   but then every 10 years, you have to get a booster, your DPT,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   booster.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.600]   Exactly.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.120]   So the children have been vaccinated there.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.160]   OK, my niece is a nephew is no problem.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.960]   Good.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.080]   It was the adult in my family who I called and said, hey,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.560]   did you get your TBD?
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.840]   Why don't you go over to Jenny McCarthy's house?
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.880]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.640]   Cough on her.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.200]   I would like to visit Ms. McCarthy.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.680]   Wouldn't that be karma?
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.520]   That'd be so funny.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.200]   It would be fun.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.760]   I wouldn't want to wish that even on Jenny McCarthy.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.720]   Also here, he's working on this third day of the fifth day
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.560]   of the year, Mr. Jeff Jarvis at his office
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.920]   at the City of Everest, even New York.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.280]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.280]   To the good work on the crew on the Best of Show.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.880]   I thought it was--
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.840]   Oh, gosh, yeah.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840]   It was a lot of glee.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.760]   It was a lot of chipotle.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.080]   So in fact, that was that great scene.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.920]   In fact, it was hard for Eileen really had to work
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.840]   because I guess we hadn't saved it or something,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.800]   but where she brings the chipotle in during the show for me.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.280]   Apparently, the Twitterer for Chipotle-- what is it?
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.920]   Chipotle tweets?
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.040]   Chipotle tweets was the underwhelmed by the whole thing.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.600]   Well, no, he came back around.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.720]   He was happy.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   OK.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.440]   Yeah, in fact, I said that they should sponsor--
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.080]   They should.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.680]   --as did other people.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.320]   They should sponsor your Facebook stream, Jeff.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.640]   You're always at Chipotle.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.720]   What was there?
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.480]   Every time I look on Facebook, Jeff says at Chipotle.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.920]   They offered me a coupon, and I said, no, just sponsor the show.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.760]   No, but I hope--
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.720]   But it has to be found out.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   I wish that they had jalapeno as a choice.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.960]   They don't, but Chipotle tweets said
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.400]   that you could ask for it, and indeed, you can get diced,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.160]   fresh jalapeno peppers from the back.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.720]   Ooh.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.080]   See, so that Twitter thing helps.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   It does.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.580]   It does.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.580]   It does.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.080]   It does.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.580]   It does.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.080]   It does.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   It is a secret menu.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   Secret menu items.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   You could also ask for more cilantro from the--
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.080]   Oh, I love this cilantro.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   I can always use more cilantro.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   I'm--
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.680]   Is the chatroom going nuts right now?
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   Oh, my god.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   They're into it already?
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   No, Chipotle rocks.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   OK.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   It's the right demographic.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   Oh, dear.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.880]   Let us talk about Google.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.560]   By the way, yes, there is a four square check-in for every chipotle in the country.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560]   Here's a four square check-in.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   I have to thank Dan Hendrix, our chat remoditorator, who created a four square check-in for our
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   CES booth.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   Right on.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.000]   So watch her some check-ins.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.280]   I know Gina and Jeff, you are not going to consumer electronics show.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   No.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.840]   Have you gone-- do you go every year Leo?
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.880]   I went every year for many years.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.840]   Last time, I stopped in 2004 because I didn't have to.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.760]   And it's pretty exhausting.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.720]   We started again last year for the Twit Network.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.200]   And in fact, I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.800]   We're sending a bunch of people down.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.720]   We will have amazing coverage starting tonight and going through all day Friday, Saturday
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.520]   and Sunday with everything you'd ever want to know.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.960]   The big story, frankly, I think at CES last year was 3D TVs.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.800]   Ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah, that took over the world, didn't it?
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.840]   I'm sure they'll be back for round two.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.560]   In fact, there are going to be a lot of 3D camcorders trying to get-- let's get some
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.560]   content here.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.840]   And let me put on some really big glasses and get a wobble headache and watch TV.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.640]   And that result is, oh, I can touch it.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.440]   I'm with you, to be honest.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.800]   But apparently, the industry is still 100% behind 3D.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.200]   And then the other story was-- because Apple hadn't yet come out with his iPad.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.560]   In fact, at the time, we thought it was going to be called the Ice Slate.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.400]   So there were all these slates.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.160]   Well, stand back.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.480]   Because if you thought there were slates and a lot of them at CES last year, this is the
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.280]   year where everybody and their brother is going to do-- and they'll all be Android-based
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280]   because Android is free.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.880]   So any manufacturer, including Asus, Visio, Motorola--
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.680]   Visio, oh, try to like us a-- we bought Visio TVs like them, but they're going to do both
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.720]   a tab and a phone this night.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.480]   Yeah, both on Android.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:09.360]   So instead of CES, we're going to call it CAT, crappy Android tablet at the time.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.880]   Lots of them will be there, I'm sure.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.600]   Actually, only one that I know of will be running Honeycomb.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   Honeycomb--
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   Why?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.760]   Well, that's-- and the reason I say that is because it requires an A9, a dual processor
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.560]   that is currently only available in the NVIDIA Tegra platform.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.920]   And Motorola's, they say, Motorola is announcing its tablet.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   They had an A9.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   That's depressing, though.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.240]   That means that my poor, beloved Galaxy tab will never run Honeycomb.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.840]   Well, and that's actually a big part of the story is because it requires dual processors.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.840]   You're right.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   Nothing out there right now.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   We'll run it.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   Although--
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   Although you're a contract.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.640]   You've got Fruio on that, right?
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.880]   Yeah, he is a bummer.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.520]   I think I'd be kidding.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.080]   So Gina's so-- so as I read that story, I've got, OK, Gina's right.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.560]   Gina's too nice to say, "I told you so."
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.120]   Was she-- Gina, were you saying, "Don't get a tablet?"
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.360]   I was just coughing out the words I told you so.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.120]   No, I told you so.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.160]   No, I feel bad.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.920]   I feel bad that your tab's going to be possibly obsolete.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   That stinks.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   That stinks.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.960]   But yeah, this is kind of the reason why I'm trying to hold out for the official tablet-ready
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.960]   Honeycomb release.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   But I don't know.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   It's tough.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.760]   When the next iPad comes out, I may buy that first.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.760]   Let me see.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.760]   All right.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.400]   The Motorola event is, I think, going on right now.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.840]   Am I right or is it tomorrow at 1 p.m.?
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   4 p.m.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.840]   It was 4 p.m.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   So it's going on this afternoon.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.360]   I'm just so glad that all of you go to CES and figure out what's important for all
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.800]   of me who just sit home and wrapped up in my blanket because I've never been to CES,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   but it sounds like a nightmare.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.440]   Well, you're going next year.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.840]   I'm making you go next year.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   I know.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.320]   I kind of like-- I can't call myself a tech journalist at all because I've never been
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   to CES.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   It sounds insane.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.120]   You've been, right, Jeff?
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.840]   I haven't been for many years, but the walking is just killer on that hard floor.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   Oh.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   Yep.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.600]   And you cannot cover it all in the amount of time allotted.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.080]   It's huge.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.200]   There's a pretty broad variety of stuff because remember, this isn't a computer show.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.800]   It's consumer electronics, which means everything from rocks for your garden that have built
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.000]   in speakers to car stereo to TVs to computers.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.840]   Do they still have the adult videos?
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.720]   They move the adult video into the adult video expo.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.680]   That used to be funny.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.120]   It was this cordoned off area.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   Right.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.040]   And you'd watch the electronics store's owners skulking in there.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.520]   My wife asked me-- because I was not planning to go.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.680]   We were not bringing our cameras there.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.040]   We do not look for coverage on Twitter, the adult video expo.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.880]   But my wife said, well, you've been there before.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.960]   I said, yeah, when I was at Tech TV, they sent me an accrue over.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960]   And it was a nightmare.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.040]   And she said, oh, yeah, you hated it.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.600]   But it was a nightmare because apparently a lot of strippers watched Tech TV.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.160]   So I'm there with a camera crew.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.840]   And they all go, yeah.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   And they're trying to give me lap dances.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   They're rubbing up against me.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.600]   And the camera crew's going, hmm, hmm.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   And I'm thinking, no, stop.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.240]   Yeah, that sounds horrible, Leo.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.800]   I mean, no, I'm just thinking of my first public image here and my wife, what she's
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.320]   going to say when she sees this video.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   So we made a quick exit.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.400]   And I am not going this year.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.120]   But yeah, they had to separate them.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.640]   They were-- the whole idea of CES is a consumer electronics show.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.960]   It brings dealers of consumer electronics to meet the manufacturers
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.680]   to decide what they're going to buy.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.760]   Usually not now, but in September, you know, for the next year's holiday buying
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.200]   season or 2011's holiday buying season.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.800]   And of course, there were a lot of video stores involved with that.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.640]   So the video cassette guys were all there and a lot of adult video.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.760]   I can't get this out of my mind.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.800]   Geek strippers.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.480]   Oh, well, OK, you know why?
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.360]   It's too great.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.280]   You know why this was?
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.200]   Because this was in the dawn of the webcam girls.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.440]   So this was-- I don't know what year, 2002 or 2003, where there were a lot of strippers,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.320]   women who realized they could kind of-- and actually it was empowering.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.960]   Girl living.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   It was feminist because they were going to get out of the strip club,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.280]   get out of the whatever unhappy situation they were in, and come from their home.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.200]   And it would be their own business and so forth.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.760]   And so remember Danny-- I can remember her last name--
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.800]   Danny's downloaded the most downloaded woman on the internet.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.440]   This was right about that time.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.080]   So it was really when the adult industry was discovering the internet.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.720]   And so that's why when I walked in-- I guess for a lot of them,
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.200]   I was teaching them how to do it.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.360]   I didn't know it.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.000]   That makes sense.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.920]   That makes a lot more sense.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.320]   Yeah, otherwise I don't think I'd have a big constituency in the--
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.000]   And geeks across the world.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Thank you for it, Leo.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.440]   The new Motorola tablet, you know.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   It makes me a lot of--
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   I am.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.000]   If I could, I would.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.760]   The new Motorola tablet is on a Tegra 2.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.840]   So it does have the A9 processor.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.680]   It's called the Atrix ATRIX 4G.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.400]   It will be AT&T.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.160]   It will support AT&T's HSPA plus network.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.040]   AT&T announced it this morning at their developers conference.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.560]   OK.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.000]   OK.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.680]   Let me look.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.880]   Let me see.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.640]   You know, the picture looks like it's a seven inch.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   I can't tell.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.560]   It doesn't-- you know, this is a pretty poor article.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.880]   It doesn't say anything about the specs just that they announced it.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.680]   So I will continue to look, if anybody knows--
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.200]   Look at that.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.480]   It says a four inch.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.440]   So if that can't be--
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.200]   No, maybe it is.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.480]   Oh, the Atrix 4G dual core smart phone.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.560]   Oh, it's a phone.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.200]   It's a phone.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.200]   Four inch, QHD, 24-bit capacitive touchscreen, microSD.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.080]   I'm looking at-- I just Google--
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.680]   I just Google it.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.120]   Google Atrix.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.360]   So that's not the tablet.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.880]   But it will be capable of running a honeycomb, presumably,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.240]   because it's got the Tegra 2 in it.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   We're going to see so much stuff this week.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.320]   And I imagine some of it will be worth looking at.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.640]   I don't know.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.520]   What I want to see is creative uses of the chipset
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.480]   and the OS in other kinds of devices.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.000]   Right.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.440]   You know, the fable internet refrigerator.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.400]   How do you see that?
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.200]   I'm sure Android will be in everything.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.560]   Yeah, I mean, how all can Ford use it in cars?
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.880]   Toyota, in fact, says they're doing a platform.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.080]   We haven't heard about it yet.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.960]   A sync-like platform for Toyota.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.640]   They're a little bit behind on that.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.440]   But, yes, of course, if you're a car manufacturer,
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.000]   the first-- now, Microsoft car powers sync.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.640]   It's a Microsoft platform, which sync is built on top of.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.960]   But if you're a manufacturer trying to compete with sync,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.920]   I would think the first thing you do is look at Android.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920]   Right.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   I saw another car.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   I can't remember who it was.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.720]   It's going to broadcast your car's location.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   Isn't it?
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.360]   Well, I didn't see that.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.720]   Well, you know, the folks parrot who do that drone helicopter that
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.040]   was really big at CES last year, they actually are an in-car
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.360]   stereo guys.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.520]   And they're making an Android-based car unit that will, in fact,
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.120]   broadcast your position and do all sorts of stuff
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.360]   and have apps on it.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.240]   It's its own platform so that they're
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.200]   hoping that people will develop specifically for the parrot
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.040]   in-car platform.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   Let me see.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.320]   They do Bluetooth hands-- oh, actually, they do a very cool
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.400]   Bluetooth hands-free set.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:51.760]   That's right.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.840]   I forgot about that.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.400]   But they have announced an Android-based in-car system
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.840]   with a knob and all sorts of stuff.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.040]   I think we're going to see-- you know what?
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.480]   Just for you, Jeff, I will wander the floor looking
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.680]   for exactly that.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.920]   Not tablets, not phones.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.640]   But new uses of Android.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.800]   And because Android's open source and free,
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.840]   anybody can do something.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.920]   That's why you're going to see all these cheap Android clones.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.800]   Is that bad, by the way?
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.520]   Chrome OS devices?
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.480]   At CES?
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.200]   I don't think so.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.680]   I don't think Google's planning that.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.520]   In fact, we know what we're not going to see,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.760]   which is kind of a surprise.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.960]   We're not going to see it Google TV devices either,
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.440]   because Google told its partners,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.600]   I can not mention Google TV.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.120]   I was indeed-- please don't talk about it.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   Did we call that a beta?
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.160]   So what is Google's presence at CES?
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.200]   They don't have a booth.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.720]   They don't have a booth.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.560]   I don't think they have any official presence there.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.120]   Oh.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.320]   In fact, as I said, the one thing they don't want--
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.960]   is anybody mentioning Google TV?
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.880]   Microsoft is going to take on-- everybody agrees--
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.960]   Google TV.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.720]   We don't know yet.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.520]   This is an official.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.160]   But the rumor is that Steve Ballmer, who speaks tonight,
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.640]   we all know he'll announce competing tablets based on Windows
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.120]   7, not on Android, obviously, for competing to the iPad.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   But the rumor is they're going to announce a $200 media center
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.560]   device that will compete with Google TV.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.920]   And I'll be honest with you, Microsoft is not like Apple
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.080]   and its ability to keep rumors quiet.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.640]   I think if this rumor is everywhere,
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.520]   I think it's probably true.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.280]   Wait, doesn't Microsoft have a gazillion media center product?
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.280]   Microsoft's biggest problem, as you're seeing right here,
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.520]   is they have a bazillion products.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.520]   Well, right.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.920]   They have the Xbox, right?
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.600]   I mean, that's--
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.920]   Xbox should be this device.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.000]   And I would hope that the capabilities of this device
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.600]   would migrate to Xbox.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.360]   They used to support media extender devices made
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.800]   by a variety of companies that would allow you to hook
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.200]   something to your TV that would then
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.960]   pull from Windows media devices and play your stuff
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.600]   on your TV.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.960]   But that wasn't-- it was-- other parties made those.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.800]   But they've never been able to make an inexpensive set top box.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.240]   No.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.760]   So this is a very interesting idea for Microsoft, especially
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.640]   if you're looking at the price tag.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.960]   Well, yeah, you know what could connect
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.440]   could be, to my mind, a really important part of that,
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.040]   because it can finally change the UI of going around a TV.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   Right.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.880]   That's a good point.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.520]   And that could be hugely important.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.400]   I mean, I'm so impressed with the Kinect.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.440]   We got it for--
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.080]   Great.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.480]   It's really great.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.520]   It's amazing.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.800]   And it does change the whole notion of UI.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.320]   On the radio show, because you have to do this,
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.760]   you gave my list of top five gadgets of 2010.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.040]   The Kinect was number five, easily, you know?
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.840]   iPad was number three.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.680]   The Nexus S was number two.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.520]   The MacBook Air was number one.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.480]   I can't remember what number four was.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.600]   It wasn't Google TV.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.120]   I'll tell you that.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.680]   It might have been--
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.280]   Good pics.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.000]   Good pics, Leo.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.800]   So far, so good.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   What did I leave out?
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.320]   Samsung Galaxy Tab?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.480]   Jeff would probably say so.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.120]   I'd like that.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.400]   I like it a lot.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.520]   I'm loving it.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.240]   Was it one of the five best things of 2010?
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.840]   Thumb typing.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.120]   You don't use swipe, because it comes with swipe on it.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.480]   I can't use swipe.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.960]   You can't-- thumb type with swipe, that's for sure.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.360]   No, swipe doesn't work the way my brain works.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:26.840]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.680]   I'm a touch typist, so I'm hitting buttons.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Because I got the Nexus S, which means I got Gingerbread
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.720]   and the new Google keyboard.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.800]   And I have to say, I was not--
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.920]   I used it for a while, and I went back to Swift Key, which
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.720]   I really like, but I always end up on swipe.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.240]   Isn't it?
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.160]   Swipes the bad.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.400]   I think Gina and I both agree that swipes the way to go.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.160]   Yeah, I was using Shapewriter.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.120]   It's kind of similar to something.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.080]   I went just going back to the stock keyboard for a little while,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.600]   because I was having trouble with the Shapewriter getting
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.120]   stuck.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.920]   It wouldn't retract, and it was bugging me.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.800]   But yeah, I'm still not--
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   I think I'm not trying.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.840]   What's that other one?
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.800]   It's not a slide keyboard, but it's a Swift Key.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   That's the one I was using.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.960]   I kind of like Swift Key.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.560]   I'm still-- I'm non-committal still on the keyboard.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.920]   The T9 is driving me nutty sometimes.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.920]   T8 is just--
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   --you just can't do.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.840]   You cannot do something like Twig.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.640]   Capital, capital, lowercase, capital, it will not let you do that.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   It will not.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.040]   So, see, Swift Key will remember it.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.120]   I mean, that's swipe.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.280]   Well, Swift Key will, too, but swipe will remember it,
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.160]   and then you can swipe it, which I do all the time.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.320]   But it won't even--
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.680]   on the regular keyboard, it won't let you do that.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.080]   You can't add to the--
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.840]   Yeah, can you-- can you add to the dictionary?
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.720]   Oh, you mean, you're just talking about the case, right?
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.120]   He wants to save the case, yeah.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   Right.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.120]   Like case, that's one example.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.360]   No, it will not let you do it.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.880]   You can manually do it 10 times.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.880]   It will not let you--
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.080]   You can blame me for that, because nobody--
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   This is Google.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   We know better.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.280]   Nobody does reverse-intercapping except Twitter.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.920]   But I do it a lot, so there.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   It's kind of--
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   I'm trying this right now.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   It's my answer to camel case.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.040]   I just say, no, I'm going to do it the other way.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.120]   What's an upside-down hump?
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   Huh?
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.120]   Huh?
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.480]   It's a-- that's what-- you know, the lowercase
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.720]   eye in the all-upper case word for twit and twig.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.480]   Why, sir?
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.480]   I like it.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.480]   I like it too.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.600]   It's a-- although I hate-- I have to say,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.160]   and as a journalist, you probably hate this too.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.960]   What, in fact, what is your policy?
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.040]   You know, remember CNET--
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   Serial commas.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   Always serial commas.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.560]   I agree.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.040]   I'm a Harvard comma guy.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.440]   But no, no, I'm not talking about that.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.640]   What do you do, Beth?
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.920]   About weird typography.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.560]   Like CNET is technically C-bar-N-E-T.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.060]   All lowercase.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:46.560]   What do you do?
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.800]   Do you just type CNET?
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:48.800]   Scrum.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   Scrum.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.040]   So in a way, you know, that's my attitude as a journalist.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.440]   But then as a brand, it's nice to have something kind of that
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.120]   stands out and is unique.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.480]   And I'm like--
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.560]   Then AOL does capital A lowercase OL now,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.200]   except in its own billboard in the valley.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.040]   It's all caps.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.760]   It's an acronym.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.800]   It should be all caps.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.760]   Changed it to AOL.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.960]   Hey!
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.600]   Well, maybe they don't want anybody to remember America online.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.360]   This may be the most ridiculous topic we've ever done on this.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.560]   Capitalization.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.320]   This brings me back to my first year life hacker, where we had
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.600]   massive internal faith about the exclamation point at the end
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.040]   of Yahoo and things like that.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   Right.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   You're not going to die.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   What did you decide?
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   Well, I want to be true to the brands.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.000]   We went exclamation point for a while.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.480]   But then I just said, this is--
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.680]   You're like your hand-shitizing.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   Yahoo!
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   Well, right.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.200]   In this end, this just wouldn't read well.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.040]   So I figured the copy was more important than the brands.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   I agree.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   Everyone would be happy.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   I agree.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.720]   And so as a journalist, I'm with you guys.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.040]   I'm saying, don't do those--
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.320]   that's like branding stuff.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   Don't do that.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.640]   Just put it into English.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.040]   But then as a brander, you want to have that.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.960]   Because that Yahoo exclamation mark is part of your look.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.680]   Yahoo should be followed by a question mark.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.680]   Yahoo?
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   Yahoo?
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   Yahoo?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.080]   That's just wrong.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.400]   But I still got a good laugh at it.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.680]   I think it's right.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.640]   It ain't wrong.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.320]   It's so wrong.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.480]   It's right.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.040]   OK, Jeff.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.640]   So I'm typing twig with capital T, capital W, and capital G,
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.000]   and a lowercase I.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.320]   And it takes a little work to do it,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.400]   because you have to hit the shift key a couple of extra times.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.280]   But then you get that-- do you get the tap to save prompt?
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.080]   No.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.480]   For the regular keyboard T9?
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.480]   Yes.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.280]   Oh, there's a tap to save prompt.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   I didn't know there was a tap to save.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   Yes.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.880]   When you type in a word that it doesn't know,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.920]   or that's not a dictionary, it will tap it.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.880]   You'll see it listed.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.680]   Oh, this is the thing you type, tap it.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.200]   And then it'll say tap to save if you want to re-type it.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.400]   Well, I'll try that.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.800]   Is that--
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.520]   Even feverish, Gina has used my proper supply.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.200]   I think I'm pretty sure.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.520]   Chat--
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.120]   All right, I'll try.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.160]   Now let's not give it a try, and we'll see if we can figure it out.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.160]   I will.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   It's like the--
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.120]   If I did it right now, I'm not going to be sticking out,
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.640]   and I'd be cursing, so I'm going to not do it now.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.160]   I do that too when you're considering.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.560]   Did you see that Google TV got jail broken?
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   Yay.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   And no, I have to--
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.440]   I have to hook my Google TV back up now.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.760]   Actually, don't not so fast.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.920]   You have to solder on a fork.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.640]   And order to load the ROM.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.440]   So not yet.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.320]   We're not there yet, but it's the beginning.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.880]   And actually, this took a lot longer than I thought it would take,
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.720]   to be honest.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.120]   I mean, I think it's just a reflection of the lack of interest.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.040]   Let me just ask.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.440]   Wouldn't jailbreaking it be the greatest favor that maybe
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.640]   people would actually write things for it
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.280]   that would make more sense?
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.680]   I mean, it requires a level of devotion from developers
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.200]   to do this type of thing.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.360]   So I think that it's a good thing.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.000]   I think jailbreaking just means that they
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.680]   replace the Flash Player inside from Google TV,
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.760]   because Hulu and those sites that are blocking
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.600]   check the version of the Flash Player.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   Oh, that was so nice.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.080]   You have to go in and you have to get access to it.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.080]   Here's what you need.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.840]   You need a brand new out-of-the-box Logitech review.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.480]   If you update it, it will stop work.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.080]   It won't work.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.600]   So I'm at a luck.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.440]   OK, you also have to solder wires to add a port
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.840]   to the motherboard of the review.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.120]   Jesus.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.200]   And then--
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.080]   Or not working.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.440]   Then you download the modified Flash Player.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.200]   Because what happens is, normally, you use the browser
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.600]   user agent to identify, oh, that's a Google TV.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   And so initially, that's what the networks and Hulu
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.040]   were doing.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.560]   They were saying, well, I see the browser you're using
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.400]   is a Logitech or a Google TV, so we're not going to let you do it.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.840]   And then Google said, well, no problem.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.880]   We'll change the user agent.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.120]   Actually, users said that.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.920]   And they said, well, we better look elsewhere.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.280]   Turns out Flash also has a non-modifiable, normally, user
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.680]   agent.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.120]   Right, unless you install another version.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.720]   You have to get a different version.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:54.980]   Right.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.840]   Jake was saying that--
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   I was finally installed the Apple TV
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.520]   and he said, you should have just gotten a Mac Mini.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.320]   It's a far better way to do it.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.560]   Yes and no.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.360]   It's interesting.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.920]   I'm actually giving a lecture on the cruise.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.960]   I'm going to be gone for three weeks in February
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.600]   in South America.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.280]   And one of the lectures is turning a Mac Mini
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.960]   into a home theater PC.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.400]   And one of the pieces of advice I'll give people--
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.200]   she's coughing.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.880]   I thought you were mocking me.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.880]   No, I was talking.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.120]   She'd have covered her mouth.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.200]   I thought she was laughing.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.080]   Well, the only reason you do it is if you want to do--
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.840]   see, it's funny.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.080]   I think I mentioned this before.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.520]   Veronica Belmont made a Google spreadsheet
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.360]   matrix of all the different units and what they can do.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:43.480]   And no one Roku popcorn hour, W.D. Live, no one unit
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.600]   does everything.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.640]   The only way to do that is to use a computer.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.760]   Then you get everything.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.280]   So that's the only compelling reason to do it.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.040]   But truthfully, it's so much more expensive.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.720]   You got to start with a 699 computer
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.160]   and you have to do a lot of messing around with it.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.720]   You might as well just get a Roku box and live with it
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.680]   and say, well, sorry.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.560]   Because you got Hulu Plus, you got Netflix,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.120]   you got Amazon, you got a bunch of third party channels,
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.800]   including Twit.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.400]   I think the Roku is still the king of the hell.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.360]   And I'm sorry, Google, but you just--
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.920]   Yeah, they blew it again.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.000]   I mean, this is like the classic Xbox hack.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.360]   Leo, do you remember this back then?
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.560]   Yeah, Bunny Wong.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.120]   Bunny Wong.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.520]   He was a guy who did that on the original Xbox.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   And I soldered more than a few chips onto an Xbox motherboard.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.520]   Yep.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.040]   Yep.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.800]   I see now Auntie Lazy.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.920]   I waited around for a little bit of a soft mod, right?
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.320]   And eventually it was a soft mod, right?
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.720]   Eventually they made--
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.480]   I think you always had to have a chip, though, right?
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.760]   But eventually they had a chip that you just used springs
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.880]   instead of soldering.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.720]   So this type of thing will get easier,
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.600]   assuming that Google TV hangs around
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.800]   and gets more developer interest.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.000]   What is it in an open platform?
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.120]   Why should you have to do this?
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.200]   I don't understand.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.160]   Well, this is the thing, right?
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.560]   It's like you go with Android, so you don't have to jailbreak.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.680]   Just the fact that they're using the word of jailbreak breaks
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.080]   my heart.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.560]   It's like, oh, back.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.240]   I might as well just buy an iPhone.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.280]   You know what?
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.200]   And Giga Ohm's "Janko Wreckers" points this out
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.320]   in his article about the hack.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.880]   The one thing all the Google needs to do is put the marketplace
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.680]   on Google TV, and you're done.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   That's what it really, really needs, for sure.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.320]   I've been liking the Google TV.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.560]   I feel like just a little bit of a wave moment again for me.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.560]   But I don't think it's that bad.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.200]   Gina, you're a jinx.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:24.480]   I know.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.280]   I feel like it's like, don't say this.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.000]   Maybe I have a high tolerance for the keyboard.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.360]   I love having the big keyboard.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.920]   I mean, I was watching the UConn Standford Women's Basketball
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.800]   game, and I had picture in picture,
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.240]   and I had the Twitter search going.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.360]   Like, it was cool.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.520]   I was like, this is really cool.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.000]   This is kind of what I wanted.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.360]   Sure, there are a lot more things I want.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   I do want the market.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.960]   I do want a lot of other apps.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   I don't want to have to deal with this blocking and jail
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.160]   breaking.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.080]   But I'm still like, this is really cool.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.920]   Now, Google sent me a Google TV unit.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.320]   I am too cheap to have gone out and bought it myself, for sure.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   So I don't think people should buy it right now.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.120]   $300 I spin on that piece of crap.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.640]   That's not--
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.880]   No, not a good choice.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.120]   True, I agree with you that the Roku is a better choice right
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.000]   now, but I think it has a lot of potential.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.680]   I bought them all.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.480]   I spent $200 on the boxy box.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:09.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.840]   How do you like the boxy box?
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.440]   It's a lot like the Google TV.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.440]   It doesn't have Netflix.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.360]   I mean, not having Netflix to me is like--
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.560]   That's a deal.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.440]   That's a deal breaker.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.360]   But it does have-- and you might like this.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.880]   What looks like the Roku remote, it's not very big.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.760]   If you flip it over, it's got a keyboard on it.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.400]   I mean, it's like kind of like the Droid Pro keyboard.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.640]   So you could type, which I think is kind of interesting.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.600]   I like the boxy software a lot.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.640]   And in fact, boxy or Plex with my choices on the Mac Mini.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   But the boxy box, because it doesn't have all--
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.480]   you know, Hulu plus.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.520]   I suppose to get that soon, doesn't have Netflix.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.240]   You know, one of the things that's going to happen at CES
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.920]   is a lot of manufacturers, including Samsung Panasonic,
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.000]   are going to have remotes that have a Netflix button,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.640]   a red Netflix button on the remote.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.280]   Jesus.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.800]   Talk about a winner.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.720]   Netflix is awesome.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.360]   They're killing it.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:07.960]   That's amazing.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.440]   They're killing it.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:08.960]   That's done.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   Remote placement.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.080]   That's awesome.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.440]   How often do people buy a new TV that maybe every five
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.600]   to 10 years, right?
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.920]   So that means that Netflix is front and center
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.400]   on that TV for the next five years.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.920]   So forget having the desktop, the screen top.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.400]   You want the clicker top.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.760]   Boy, do you want a clicker top.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.280]   There's not a lot of real estate on a remote.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.880]   If you have a Netflix button on a remote--
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.280]   You own it.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.160]   And Netflix earned that.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.440]   Netflix is awesome.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.040]   It's awesome.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.360]   I've been so sick the past week.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.240]   Netflix saved me.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.680]   I just-- so great.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.960]   The streaming is amazing.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.800]   I agree.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.440]   My daughter came home from college
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.760]   and spent two weeks watching Netflix on the Roku.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.400]   That's all she did.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   She said, why didn't you tell me about this?
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   And she speaks French, so she was
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.680]   watching a lot of French movies.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.640]   There's actually an interesting collection of stuff.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.240]   It's not too bad.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.360]   And what happens is, yeah, the movie you want,
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.240]   you can't get-- you have to get that on DVD.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.000]   But there's so many movies that are OK.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.880]   They just watch those instead.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.640]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.140]   All right.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.880]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.600]   We'll come back with more.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.200]   There's a lot going on.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.160]   Amazon is going to go into competition with Google.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.680]   Google is going into competition with Apple.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:24.920]   The Chrome Store, a little bit of a disappointment.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.440]   We'll talk more about all of that in just a bit.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.000]   This week, Google's on the air with Gina Tripani
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.200]   from smarterware.org.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.160]   And ThinkUp, a great tool.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.400]   Mr. Martin likes that tool.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   Yay.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.920]   So that was right in telling him that the CSV button on ThinkUp
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.760]   downloads-- is it all of his tweets and all the replies?
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.880]   You can export-- well, the CSV link, yeah,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.840]   you export all your tweets.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.920]   It's just your tweets.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.080]   You can also search an export and filter, replies, repeats.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.640]   But you can.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.760]   Yeah, because that's what he wants.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.120]   Not just his--
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.680]   His own.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.120]   He won't reply as well.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.880]   He can get that.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.520]   In fact, I should make a new file that's
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.640]   sort of structured that way, where it shows his--
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.040]   it's a comma-separated value.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.040]   This is one of my moments where I was like, oh, maybe this
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   isn't the best label for the export button.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.960]   CSV is meaningless.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.200]   I sent him an email, too, and I realized I had to do--
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.760]   it's a comma-separated value.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.560]   It's parentheses CSV file you can import into Excel.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.760]   Yeah, terrible, terrible UI on my part.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.640]   So that was a learning moment.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   Geeks like it, though.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.960]   Well, he said, you know, I got my CVS file, and I was like, oh,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.520]   it's not that fun to see.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.000]   Bad choice on my part.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.360]   So we're going to label that button soon.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.200]   Anyway, Steve Martin is using Gina's software.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.800]   He's a beta tester.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.520]   That's a pretty good beta tester.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.840]   Almost as good as a Twitfez.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.440]   Well, I've been using it, too, and it's really-- it's so cool.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.520]   You have at some point a plan--
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.320]   I mean, you can download the server and install it.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.160]   But you have at some point a plan for somebody
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.480]   to make a service using this?
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.040]   Actually, we just put together my coworker, Andy Baio,
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.360]   put together super simple steps to deploy
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.720]   think up to an Amazon EC2 instance.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.440]   It takes under 10 minutes.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.000]   And Amazon's actually doing this deal.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.800]   If you're a new EC2 customer, you get a free instance.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.360]   I mean, it's a tight-- it's a micro instance,
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.400]   so you get maybe 600 megabytes of storage.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.720]   It's a smaller instance, but for free for a year.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.200]   So if you want to try think up--
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.800]   yeah, go to thinkupapp.com or get in touch with the mailing list.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.480]   It literally-- it's nine steps.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.960]   So it'll take you about 10 minutes.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.040]   You can have think up up and running on the EC2 instance,
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.800]   so you don't even need a web host.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.200]   And we hope to do more of that kind of one-click install.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   Are you going to do a hosted version of--
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.960]   That's what I want.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.640]   I think some companies should try along and make think up.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.360]   I'm not.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.640]   But maybe-- I'm not in the near future.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.320]   It's just a scaling issue.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.440]   And it's just like, do I really want to replicate,
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.720]   try and replicate Twitter and Facebook's databases?
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.920]   First of all, I can.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.400]   I mean, it's just a--
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.160]   Have-- would you just buy this thing from Gina?
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.000]   I mean, it's just a peer-to-peer hook at some point.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.800]   Come on, Costolo.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.320]   Get off your duff and buy think up.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.680]   But we do want to make it as easy as possible for folks
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.000]   to try it out without having to go through as much--
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.960]   Yeah, I like the EC2 instance, but that's still pretty--
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.640]   I mean, I don't think Steve Martin's going to be setting up
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.880]   an EC2 instance in the near future.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   Right.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   Right.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.360]   I actually-- before I sent him to you, I said, well,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.600]   I'll just install it, and he can run it on my server.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.560]   And then I don't have the PHP data objects installed,
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.240]   whatever that--
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.400]   Yeah, PTO, right.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.560]   So guess what?
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.400]   You have to recompile PHP to put it in.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.400]   That's a bummer.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.600]   I'm not doing that.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.560]   As much as I'd like to run think up on my own server.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.640]   So do we have to thank the triple AS
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.240]   for providing you with the bandwidth?
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:39.840]   Yeah, triple AS.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.280]   Well, triple AS is our parent organization.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.920]   So they in the MacArthur Foundation fund expert lab.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.840]   So they're giving me a couple of servers
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.400]   to deploy to folks with good data for everyone
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.760]   from the White House to see Martin now.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.880]   So we're equally excited about all those.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.960]   That's pretty good.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.880]   So they've been fantastic.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.360]   Triple AS has been very supportive.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.040]   And you're on GitHub.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.840]   If you search GitHub for ThinkUp,
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   you can download the code.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.720]   Run the server.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.480]   Point seven is the current version is--
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:06.980]   Yep.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.720]   It's just PHP.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.280]   It's nothing too fancy.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.000]   PHP and MySQL, right?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.960]   PHP and MySQL, yep.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.400]   And you need the PHP data objects.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.440]   There you need PDO.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.920]   You do need PDO and GD and a couple of more events.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.400]   I have everything.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.000]   And everything except PDO.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Except PDO.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.120]   Damn.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.560]   So close.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.600]   But still, it means I got to email Steve Martin.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.040]   So you know--
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:28.280]   I know.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:28.960]   I'm glad, actually.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.040]   I worked out pretty well.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:30.960]   I worked out pretty well.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.480]   Thank you again.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.160]   You have this super secret email address.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   Do not.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.960]   Do not give that out.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.480]   You can also follow Jeff Jarvis.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.800]   I was giving him a big plug to Gina.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.240]   But let me give a big plug to Jeff Jarvis.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.760]   His book is What Would Google Do?
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.600]   And his blog is Buzzmachine.com.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.480]   And we will be right back with more conversation
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.120]   about Google and the cloud in just a minute.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.560]   But before we go much further, I
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.840]   got to thank our friends at Ford.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.760]   We're about to head down to Las Vegas.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.000]   And I'll tell you what, couldn't afford to do this
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.840]   if it weren't for Ford sponsoring our trip.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.400]   It is a very expensive enterprise,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.120]   as you might imagine, bringing 15 people to Las Vegas,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.840]   putting them up, feeding them, let alone
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.760]   all the equipment, the gear, the stage.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.040]   And Ford is saying, no, we want you to do this.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.640]   Now, good news.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.680]   Ford's going to be very much a part of CES.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.240]   Alan Malali is giving a keynote, I think tomorrow morning.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.800]   And we will be talking to Alan shortly after that.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.120]   Maybe Friday morning, and we'll be talking to Alan shortly
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.640]   after that keynote speech.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.760]   CEO of Ford.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.360]   He's a fascinating guy.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.560]   Former Boeing engineer, he designed the 777 cockpit
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.440]   and came to Ford and really has taken that company
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.520]   and turned it around.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.640]   Well, I don't want to say turn it around,
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.680]   because they never took any money from the federal government.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.120]   They were always solvent.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.640]   You know, he's just making great cars
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.880]   and he's making the American industry proud
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.240]   and I'm very proud to drive a Ford.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.360]   That Ford Mustang, right there in the backlot, sweet.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.640]   It's got the Ford Sync installed.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.240]   That's one of the reasons I love it.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.040]   True hands-free calling.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.280]   You just press a button on the steering wheel.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.360]   You never take your eyes off the road
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.200]   or your hands off the wheel.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.720]   That's the whole, that's the motto.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.560]   Just think of that.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.400]   Don't, you focused on what you're doing,
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.560]   which is most important, which is driving.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.480]   But you're still connected to the world.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.600]   It works great with Android phones.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.960]   My Droid X actually reads me text messages as they come in
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.600]   and I can send canned messages out.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.920]   I can call anybody without taking my hands off the wheel.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.600]   I just press the button on the steering wheel.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.080]   True hands-free calling.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.200]   I say call Gina Trapani on cell.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.120]   Boom, it even understands Trapani.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.440]   It actually understands 10,000 commands.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.600]   And because it downloads your address book
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.800]   from your phone, it knows everybody you know
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.280]   knows all their phone numbers.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.360]   You got it all in the Ford.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.200]   Turn by turn directions to GPS is built into a Ford Sync.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.320]   Personalized traffic alerts and weather.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.560]   911 Assist.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.320]   And a personalized vehicle health report, which I love.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.760]   I said it for every 5,000 miles,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.040]   but you can do it on demand.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.520]   And it will go through the car,
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.600]   tell you all about what's going on internally.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.880]   Give you all the recall or maintenance information you need.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.360]   You can even schedule service online at syncmyride.com.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.920]   Now take that and now get in a new Ford Edge
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.280]   with a new Ford Focus and you'll see the My Ford Touch.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.720]   Some of the Lincoln's have it too.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.440]   That is taking sync plus.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.360]   You got the eight inch screen.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.200]   You got the five way touch pads on the steering wheel.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.560]   You got the LCD screens.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.040]   I mean, it's like you're in a command center.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.720]   You actually are.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.040]   I love it and I want you to try it.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.000]   Go to your local Ford or Lincoln dealer in test drive.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.680]   My Ford Touch and Sync.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.720]   And if you want to know more,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.120]   you can also go to syncmyridepodcast.com for demos
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.640]   and all the information you need.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.040]   And we do thank Ford so much for sponsoring our coverage
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.120]   of CES 2011.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.800]   It all begins tonight, 7 p.m. Pacific Thursday night.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.640]   No, I'm sorry, Wednesday night, 7 p.m. Pacific.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.800]   Becky Worley and Tom Merritt will be live
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.400]   from digital experience, 7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.040]   Then tomorrow, 1 p.m. Pacific, Sarah Lane and I
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.160]   kick the whole thing off.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   It's going to be fun. The show floor opens tomorrow.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.520]   All right.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.120]   Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis and Moi,
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.640]   we're talking about Google.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.240]   Amazon says, we're going to open an app store.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.640]   This is an interesting play.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.960]   This is again something that happens
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.240]   because of the openness of Android.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.400]   Android has its marketplace that comes with Google phones.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.080]   That's a, now that's a Google product.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.920]   So you'd have, do you have to do a Google deal
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.280]   to have the marketplace in there?
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.040]   In other words, are these Chinese tablet manufacturers not?
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.400]   They don't get Gmail.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.800]   They don't get Maps.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.200]   Do they get marketplace?
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.480]   That's a good question.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.360]   I mean, I know for sure that the, excuse me,
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.040]   the Gmail app is a closed source.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.240]   So you can, you can, you can, you can.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.400]   I think the marketplace has two.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.680]   I believe the market is as well.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.520]   You can download Maps, but if you don't have marketplace,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.560]   you can't download marketplace.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.120]   I mean, I guess you could get an APK file somewhere.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.880]   So this kind of is an interesting play.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.080]   Amazon's saying, well, you don't need Google.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.280]   In fact, anybody could write that Google layer.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.600]   That's what people with your theorizing Facebook might do,
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.360]   is take the Android base, and instead of using the Google apps,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.040]   put Facebook apps on top of it.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.240]   - So would they ship a device with only the Facebook market
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.680]   on it, or is Amazon, I mean, because don't you need the market
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.080]   in order to get the Amazon market?
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.400]   Or is this, you know what I mean?
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.240]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.640]   Well, so, okay, so those of us who have standard Android devices,
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.200]   we can download the Amazon App Store.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.560]   I don't know, first of all, it's just getting started.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.720]   It won't be available till later this year,
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.680]   but they're now, the developers are being invited to participate.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.080]   To, as of today, if you're a developer,
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.200]   you can go to developer.amazon.com
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.000]   and find out more about it.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.600]   - Isn't that still good for Google?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.960]   I mean, Eric Schmidt said a year ago
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.720]   that the one with more apps win.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.280]   - 200,000 apps are at last count, by the way.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.620]   That's amazing.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:03.620]   - I mean, Apple's got 300,000, but the gap is closing
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.800]   very, very, very, very fast.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.760]   - This is a great thing.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.960]   Developers are used to making money,
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.640]   making money through Amazon, right?
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.280]   I mean, not quite this way, but certainly through referrals.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.240]   And Amazon's gonna, you know, their market's gonna be really good.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.560]   They have a great recommendation engine.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   They're gonna do a lot of good, like, you like this app,
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.160]   then you're gonna love these other three apps,
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.880]   it's kind of things.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.120]   And your friends have looked at,
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.360]   I don't know if they do, do they do much social?
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.740]   They don't do very much social,
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.380]   but Amazon is really good at recommending stuff that you like.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.460]   So this is great.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.300]   I think it's great for Google.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.580]   I think it's good for developers.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.660]   I'm interested to know how it would work.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.140]   You know, how do I get the Amazon market or, you know,
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.540]   are Amazon gonna ship devices?
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.300]   Are they gonna ship a device with them?
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.580]   You know, the Amazon market on it only.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.900]   Like, that seems a little far-fetched.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.700]   - Well, as more companies don't partner with Google
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.780]   when they put out their devices,
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.900]   then there might be a natural thing
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.020]   to put the Amazon marketplace on there.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:55.860]   What does it take? - Makes sense.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.640]   - Now load an app into the phone.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.160]   If Gina, you wrote an app tomorrow
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.080]   and just wanted to give it to the two of us,
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.840]   what would it take? - Oh, take pain.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.800]   - Well, I would just,
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   well, I would send you a link to the APK file, right?
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.720]   But you have to set your phone to install APKs
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.240]   from unverified sources, on signed sources.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.440]   That's not really a big deal,
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.440]   but it's kind of, that's a setting
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.360]   that you'd have to go into.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.280]   You'd have to do that for Amazon too, by the way.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.640]   I presume on our phones,
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.120]   you'd have to say allow third-party sources.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:21.960]   - That's what I'm saying.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.160]   All credit by Amazon, do that.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.600]   'Cause they hook in and just do that for you.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.420]   - Right, I mean, I wonder if there's a way to say Amazon
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.740]   is a trusted delivery mechanism for apps
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.580]   and have that set as a, you know,
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.900]   - It doesn't look like Google fight Amazon.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.100]   - I wouldn't, they don't take a cut.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.940]   Does Google take a cut?
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.300]   No.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.940]   You can buy, I mean, Google,
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.700]   you see, Amazon would take that 70/30 split.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:41.620]   - Right.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.540]   - But Amazon would then take some of the money they make,
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.700]   I think, and they're gonna vet apps.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.040]   You have to get approval.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.260]   They say currently it's a one-week approval,
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.380]   but it could get longer if a lot of people do it.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.020]   I think users are gonna like that
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.700]   'cause they're gonna have some perception
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.520]   that it's safer or more secure.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.720]   There won't be porn or illegal apps,
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.400]   but they won't be as strict they say
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.580]   as Apple is with its apps.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.100]   - Father jobs.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:10.400]   And does the deal tie into Amazon Web Hosting?
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.320]   I mean, as a developer, is this just--
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.960]   - Yeah, oh, I would guess.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.960]   I don't know, but I would guess it'd be just like Apple
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.200]   where they host it for you.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.040]   - Right.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   - I mean, they gotta give you something for the,
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.100]   that's a 30%.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.560]   Oh, by the way, they set the price.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.660]   This is what's gonna piss off developers.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.720]   You can set a suggested list price,
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.960]   but Amazon reserves the right to charge anything they want.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.540]   - Oh, it's just like books.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.780]   - Just like books.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.780]   - Ugg.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.620]   - Yeah, I think--
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.200]   - They'll take no money on books that get sold on Amazon
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.360]   because they like lower the price so much.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.520]   - It was good right up to that point, wasn't it?
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.360]   - It was.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.840]   - And then all of a sudden it's like,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.940]   well, why would I do that?
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.320]   Now, neither marketplace will have exclusivity,
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.240]   at least as of now, so you could be on both.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.480]   But of course, Amazon could undercut the price
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.400]   on the Google marketplace.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.880]   Amazon, the setup is, you set a list price.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.600]   That's the price you want it to be.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   Amazon uses a variety of market factors
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.880]   to decide what price it will use.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.400]   You get 70% of Amazon's price,
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.080]   but they guarantee that you won't get any less
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.480]   than 20% of the list.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.400]   So if they discount it, if you charge,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.520]   say I want 10 bucks and they discount it to $1,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.360]   you still guaranteed $2 somehow.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.180]   (laughs)
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.080]   I don't know how.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.400]   Is Amazon gonna make up the difference?
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.000]   I guess Amazon will never set it below $2.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.840]   - Interesting.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.200]   - So they could do specials on apps.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.760]   They could drive to do Amazon.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.600]   - That's the idea.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.800]   - They could do bundles, they could do specials,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.680]   they drive traffic.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.280]   They will, I mean, I don't know, you're a developer, Gina.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.920]   Both, it rankles, but on the other hand,
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.080]   can you say no?
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.000]   - I mean, just like being an author,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.480]   my book has to be on Amazon, right?
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.880]   So I mean, it may get to that point,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.960]   the same point with apps where, hey,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.000]   I definitely want my app to be on Amazon.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.320]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.360]   It bugs me a little bit.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.480]   I mean, really, are people gonna run to buy your app
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.120]   if it's 50 cents less or a dollar less?
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.000]   I mean, how much of a sale are we talking about here?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.160]   A couple bucks, right?
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.520]   I mean, that's the most expensive app.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.800]   I mean, except for that $1,000.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.560]   - Is there a $1,000 Android app?
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.720]   - Wasn't there, it wasn't there.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.560]   - That was an Apple app.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.400]   - That Apple app.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.720]   - Yeah, yeah, which was a gag, right?
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.200]   - Actually, there is a real $1,000 Apple app
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.000]   that is training for some sort of certification
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.680]   that is actually worth it.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.640]   - Just actually, yeah.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.720]   - Oh, personally.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.680]   - Hey, as a developer, I would definitely put my app
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.600]   on every venue, right, to sell it.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.440]   It doesn't bug me too much.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.320]   I mean, not a lot of developers
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.360]   even charging for their apps right now,
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.240]   which I think is a mistake.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.080]   I think more than an operation.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.080]   - Didn't Rovio say, didn't the developer,
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.080]   the guy who wrote the Angry Birds software, said,
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.320]   "We still prefer iOS.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.560]   "Not that we make more money,
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.640]   "we just like the platform better."
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.200]   I think he recently said that.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.120]   - Oh, did they?
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:53.960]   - Yeah.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.800]   - Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.240]   I haven't done a whole lot of iOS development.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.200]   In fact, I've only dabbled in Android development.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.880]   I'm still really kind of a new, you know,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.000]   bold development.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.920]   - You and I both got the test app running.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.480]   - We got the right, I got the whole world that way.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.680]   - The whole world, yeah.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.320]   - I mean, I think we can extrapolate from,
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.480]   I mean, Google's tools are very powerful and very nerdy.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.360]   Apple's tools are, you know, a lot more elegant, maybe,
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.480]   and a little more aesthetic, maybe a little more limiting,
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.320]   but still.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.680]   So I can see, you know, why it might be more pleasant,
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.360]   the SDK might be more pleasant to work with,
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.240]   but I'm not sure I haven't done any iOS development.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.600]   - You know, I don't know if this is new or not.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.440]   I'm just seeing conversation in chat room plus.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.240]   - I see your link here that you just put in.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.760]   - I just added a link to a video on
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.120]   Engadget for a Honeycomb preview.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.640]   I don't know if that's new or not.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.060]   - I've been seeing it.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.640]   Let's see here.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.600]   The video is embedded below.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.520]   - It wasn't up for a while.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.880]   Like it was coming up private, but--
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:56.600]   - It's a source of Android developers on YouTube.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.680]   So let's watch a little bit.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.760]   - Head and shoulders is--
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.080]   - Oh, let's not watch a head and shoulders that, however.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.720]   (laughing)
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.240]   - You trying to tell me something?
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.140]   - Hey, what are you talking about?
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:11.160]   - They call them AD shampoos.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.920]   - Engadget says, "Perhaps the best thing to say
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.520]   is that this looks more or less nothing like Android."
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.120]   - Huh.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.120]   - The browser is the same,
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.600]   the Gmail app will be familiar iPad users,
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.760]   but trust us when we say there's a lot of lovely Y
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.000]   in the video above.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.880]   - This is gonna-- - This is gonna--
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.040]   - Oh, this is gonna kill me.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.040]   - 'Cause this is what you can't get on your Samsung.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.120]   Oh, look at that.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   - Ooh. - Ooh.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.200]   - Very wizzy.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.440]   Dragon drop icon.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.440]   Yeah, this is why it needs two processors.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.120]   Um...
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:48.480]   Experience is the full Web, best of class web browsing.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.160]   Well, we got that, you're not losing anything there.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.480]   There's that honeycomb style or gingerbread style.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.920]   - I don't actually like that much.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.480]   - This is the Google eBooks.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.840]   Nice bookstore, big deal.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.840]   - Only cover flow page turn.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.520]   - Yeah, very cover flowy.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.800]   Yeah, page turn, we can leave that out.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.200]   Tablet optimized Gmail.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.040]   But this looks very much,
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.200]   that looks just like the iPad.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.960]   - Well, how's it how big the tablet is, too?
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:11.800]   - Huh?
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.640]   You just redesigned, this is the YouTube lean back, isn't it?
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.640]   So that's what they're showing there.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.440]   Newly redesigned you.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.240]   Chat face to face with hundreds of milliliters
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.480]   of Google talk users.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.960]   Wait a minute, front facing camera?
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.880]   - It has to be, right?
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.640]   There's the Google Maps.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.000]   - I'm not showing off the vector Google Maps.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.280]   - So they're doing FaceTime with GTalk.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.680]   Can you do GTalk video now?
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.760]   No, you can't, can you?
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.600]   - I don't know.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.360]   - You'll like this Samsung just announced
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.760]   the Wi-Fi only Galaxy.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.600]   Oh, you won't like that.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.920]   - Oh, poor Jeff, Jeff is just getting out of there.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.360]   - Lord beat them up here.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.560]   - All the cost of being an early adopter.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.600]   - I said, mine was a loner from Sprint,
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.520]   which I have sent back since, but I liked it.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.240]   And obviously a lot of people liked it.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.080]   So as we mentioned.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.440]   - I'm using it so much, I'm getting back.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.920]   The only problem with it is,
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.960]   you're stuck for two years, yeah.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.160]   - That's the problem.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.440]   And Verizon just cut the price from $5.99 to $500.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.280]   - Right.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.120]   - And it only rebated the money for the last two weeks
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:13.960]   of purchases.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.800]   - Huh.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.440]   Well, you really did get screwed on that one.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.280]   - Hey, hey.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.120]   (laughing)
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.040]   - You really did.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.240]   So honeycomb win.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.840]   When do we see honeycomb?
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.720]   Have they said later this year?
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.240]   They've just said, we'll see you probably a lot
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.400]   of tablets with honeycomb.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.320]   I will make a very big point to get some honeycomb.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.480]   We're gonna do iPad Today tomorrow morning
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.760]   and release it by Friday.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.880]   And even though it's our iPad show,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.080]   I think because we're at CES,
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.360]   a lot of the coverage will be iPad competitors.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.360]   And we'll certainly get some honeycomb video for you, Jeff.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.920]   And I'll get a hands-on for you.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.760]   If it's available.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.600]   - It's a rub it in.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.920]   - Just to make you crazy.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.720]   Wall Street Journal says,
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.040]   Google Digital Newsstand aims to muscle in on Apple.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.220]   Is this a new Google application?
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.800]   Google's trying to drum up publishing support right now
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.240]   for a new Google operated digital newsstand
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.480]   for Android devices.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.080]   So you would buy magazines.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.680]   It'd be, I guess, marketplace for magazines.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.400]   It would include apps from media companies.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.480]   So if, for as Rupert Murdoch wanted to put his daily on this,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.840]   which is an app, he could do it.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.360]   Google hopes to launch it in part to provide a more,
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.560]   this is from the Wall Street Journal,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.120]   to provide a more consistent experience
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.960]   for consumers who want to read periodicals on Android devices.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.640]   This is one area where iPad is owned, Android.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.480]   - Yes.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.440]   - But mostly because of the screen.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.520]   - Mostly because of that.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.920]   And I'm going to use one of my numbers now.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.880]   But the magazine apps have not done well.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.560]   They've gone down.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.080]   - Although some are saying,
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.560]   now I've seen some dissent saying,
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.400]   well, they've gone down.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   But if you look at the paper sales,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.120]   they've gone down at the same rate.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.200]   That those, that drop in periodical sales on electronic platforms
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.640]   mirrors the drop in periodical sales in general.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.480]   - No, not really.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.400]   Here's Wired is down.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.600]   And this is, you know, a reparative a few months from 31K to 22K.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.080]   Okay. They were first in a lot of curiosity.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.400]   Vanity Fair down from 10.5K to 8,700.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.400]   Clammer down 20% from 4,300 to 2,275.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:33.200]   GQ 11,000, which is his worst performance since April 13,000.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.680]   So they're all down and they're brand new
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.720]   and sales of the tab are going up.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.560]   - Right.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.720]   - So I...
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.840]   - I have some theories.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.800]   Now, by the way, those publications you mentioned,
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.880]   mostly Hearst and Conde Nast,
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.840]   Time, Hearst and Conde Nast,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.280]   all three, and according to the journal conversations
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.240]   with Google, but all three declined to comment.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.480]   Part of the problem I have to say
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.280]   is that in many cases in the iPad,
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.240]   you pay more for the iPad version
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.640]   than you do for the paper version.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.440]   And even if you're already, as I am,
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.400]   subscribe to The New Yorker,
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.600]   you get no break on the $4.99 iPad version.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.640]   - Tradiculous, you get no value added, really.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.480]   - You know who does this right is the economists.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.400]   I think you get a discount,
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.120]   plus there's additional content, there's video.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.040]   They seem to be--
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.160]   - I think buying the magazine and the,
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.720]   I saw the somewhere buying the magazine
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.400]   and the app for the economists
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.680]   is cheaper than buying the magazine alone.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.240]   - There you go.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.080]   There you go.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.760]   The journal does that too.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.920]   I wanted to cancel my paper journal
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.560]   'cause I have the Wall Street Journal on iPad
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.120]   and it costs more.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.400]   The paper is not just free, they subsidize it.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.240]   I know, that's bizarre, but I guess,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.400]   from an advertiser point of view,
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.040]   they really still want to sell those display ads, is that it?
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:48.880]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.720]   - Yeah.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.760]   So--
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.280]   - So I guess the Google newsstand
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.840]   will probably be more flexible in business models
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.920]   than Apple- - Exactly.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.120]   - I think that's the-- - And that's exactly it.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.040]   - And Google wants to make nice with publishers
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.600]   because they're constantly accused,
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.760]   wrongly I think, of killing publications.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.760]   And so it'll put pressure on Apple and Amazon,
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.520]   which is a good thing for publishers.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.320]   - Now, Apple-- - So I think
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.760]   if it doesn't work, just the fact
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.040]   that they created competitive pressures--
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:16.880]   - It'll be a lot.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.040]   - Or who would publishers that are screwing them
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.000]   will be helpful.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.200]   - Well, in fact, Apple already is kind of responding.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.040]   Apple says we're gonna make it easier to do
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:28.120]   in application subscriptions, to sell subscriptions online.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.520]   So this is the problem, it's very,
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.400]   Apple takes its 30% cut
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.320]   out of in-app purchases.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.480]   And I mean, there's also,
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.040]   and the publishers don't get the email address.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.480]   They're not getting information.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.360]   So Apple apparently is also gonna adjust
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.920]   how things go in iTunes.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.240]   They also plan to give that information to the publisher.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.040]   - With, but that's the interesting thing.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.360]   The fight that I read that they're having
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.000]   is that Apple would make that an opt-in.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.840]   - Right.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.960]   - To allow me to send your name to the publisher.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.280]   And of course, the publishers want that
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.120]   to be an opt-out.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.960]   - Right.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:10.120]   - We have said many times that all of this is just a,
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.680]   a holding action for paper publishers
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.400]   who are dying anyway.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.120]   You think there's any scenario that makes a company
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:23.000]   like Hearst or Condi Nast make this transition and survive?
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.440]   - I just think the cost structure is way too high.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.480]   I had lunch today with Fred Cybert
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.280]   who started Next New Networks.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.200]   - Yeah.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.800]   - And now are they selling to?
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.320]   - There are only rumors, shall we say?
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.720]   - Did he confirm?
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.760]   - I will say nothing.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.600]   - Okay.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.680]   - 'Cause that's the big rumor.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.520]   - He was a good boy.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.360]   - He was a good boy.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.200]   He said nothing.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.960]   - 'Cause that's the, but he didn't see it in Denyad.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.600]   - I know Nastad.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.080]   - So that's the rumor is that Google was--
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:48.920]   - The rumor is there.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.000]   The rumor is there and well known.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.200]   But, you know, we were having this discussion about,
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.520]   I, you know, ever the dystopian utopianist,
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.080]   I hope that--
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.080]   - Is that a thing?
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.560]   What is it dystopian utopianist?
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.400]   - I just, they're dystopia is my utopian.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.440]   - Oh, okay, I get it.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.880]   - Right, that killing off--
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.120]   - Bad news for them is good news for us.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.560]   - Bad excellences about openness
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.720]   and its about disruption.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.560]   - I agree.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.400]   I'm with you.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.920]   - Taking their hegemony away from our media experience.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.240]   And so, you know, he thinks that the big old companies
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.080]   will eventually come around.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.680]   I think there isn't enough time for many of them
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.040]   and they'll die.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.840]   And the problem is cost structure.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.520]   I've said it before, the Washington Post is 2000 employees.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.240]   TBD in Washington is 55 employees.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.440]   The issue isn't top line size,
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.960]   the issue is profitability.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.800]   - Yeah.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.960]   - And a new company running on free platforms,
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.720]   using smart collaborative mechanisms
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.480]   and specializing can be profitable much, much, much faster.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.760]   I think that's the issue for Kanye and Aston Hurston.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.480]   And let's not count out.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.640]   And I think I would have been shocked a year ago
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.240]   to hear myself say this, the Kindle.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.760]   This is absolutely an equal platform
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.480]   with the iPad and the Android phone.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.760]   I mean, complete parody.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.000]   They sold so many kindles.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.160]   And if you throw the Nook in, might even be bigger.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.440]   - The Nook, you see the Nook got hacked
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.280]   to have a full Android.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.120]   - Full Android, it's a tablet now.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.680]   Not much processing power, it ain't gonna be run.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.520]   Honeycomb.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.820]   But it's color, it's Android.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.980]   So for instance, Barnes and Noble offers subscriptions
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.740]   to 14 Hearst publications,
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.540]   including Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan and Esquire.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.140]   Kindle of course, when it launched,
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.340]   had very few publications,
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.940]   but is more and more all the time.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.060]   News Corp, now this is a Wall Street Journal article,
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.660]   so I presume they know what News Corp's up to.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.420]   News Corp has been trying to sign up publishers
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.940]   for an online news stand where consumers would pay
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.060]   to access digital publications from a variety of companies,
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:59.340]   but it shelved that project this past fall.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.180]   So they had been--
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.660]   - They were trying to get it, 'cause the deal there was,
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.620]   they wanted everybody to go behind the wall,
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.820]   and they wanted to have a kind of one price bundle.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.220]   Like cable, they wanted to recreate the cable model.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:11.060]   - No interesting.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.540]   - But it's never worked with print publications.
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.220]   And it was triply absurd and insane.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.420]   - No, people subscribe to A Magazine, not a news stand.
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.540]   We know Monica Ray, executive vice president
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.100]   of Consumer Marketing, Conde Nast.
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.940]   We know consumers want an ongoing relationship
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.860]   with our print and digital products,
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.660]   and we are working with all partners to achieve that.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.420]   Conde, who is the most forward thinking in this space?
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.660]   Is it Conde Nast?
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:41.260]   - Well, what's happened lately,
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:42.460]   it's getting off the reservation here,
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.220]   but the top publishers have all changed CEOs lately.
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.660]   Time Inc, Conde Nast, Hearst,
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.900]   each have new CEOs.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.300]   I think the most forward thinking that I know about there
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.940]   is the Atlantic.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.900]   - I think all, they went on the web open and free
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.180]   couple of years ago.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.140]   - Yeah, and Justin Smith, who's the CEO
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:06.020]   who had launched the Week in America and did a surprise.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.340]   - I love the Week.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.100]   - He did a great, great job of launching that.
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:10.700]   - I subscribed, it's funny that you should say that,
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.180]   'cause guess what I subscribe to?
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.020]   The New Yorker, The Week, and Atlantic.
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.100]   Paper versions.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.020]   - There you are.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.620]   So Justin said, he was interviewed in the Times
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.580]   about two weeks ago and said,
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.220]   and this is the beautiful thing that I haven't heard
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.540]   any other publisher say, is he said,
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.900]   we sat down and said, how do we disrupt ourselves?
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.780]   - Yeah.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:30.060]   - And so they hired Andrew Sullivan as a blogger,
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.580]   they got the web going big,
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:34.540]   they know that the web is the future,
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.820]   and the owner, who's a very, very smart guy,
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.180]   whose name is suddenly escaping me,
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.140]   brought in Justin and gave him the reign
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.940]   to change the company radically.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.460]   And the Atlantic is small enough
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.900]   and is owned by a single operator, they can do that.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.460]   - The risk is just so great with these other companies,
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.780]   they're not gonna do that.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:56.900]   - What magazines do you read, Gina?
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.140]   I'm just curious.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.460]   - Magazines?
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.580]   (laughing)
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:03.340]   - Just gonna say, Magazines?
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.860]   - What is this, Magazines, I wish you talk.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.860]   - I don't know this.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.660]   - You don't get any print magazines?
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:12.860]   - I mean, I get wired, but I feel like that happens
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:14.500]   sort of by accident, I don't think, I don't know.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.740]   - You gotta free, I got it.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.780]   - Yeah, I gotta free, 'cause I bought something or something.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.980]   - Yeah, no, I don't, I don't read print magazines.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.540]   I read stuff on the web that I find through my friends.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.860]   I'm not necessarily, I mean, I read a lot of those titles
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.340]   that you mentioned, I read the Atlantic a lot,
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.100]   I read Times a lot, but I happen upon these things online.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.580]   I don't have a lot of paper.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.100]   I'm also like, I'm a little bit of a clutter,
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.300]   I don't like having papers sort of stacked up around the house.
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.380]   - You know what, I do, I make my own magazine
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.180]   with InstaPaper, I'm going through the web,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.060]   I find articles I wanna read and I InstaPaper,
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.380]   I'm gonna email it to the Kindle so I can read it there
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.220]   or on my iPad.
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:49.900]   - Mm-hmm, yep.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.220]   - 'Cause there's a great InstaPaper app on the iPad
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.460]   and that's kind of my own magazine.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.580]   - Yep, yep, absolutely, I do some other thing.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.220]   I have to switch to InstaPaper, I've been kind of like--
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:00.700]   - You do read it later? - Coming and high.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.140]   Yeah, I do read it later and now I just, I gave in
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.060]   and just switched to Chrome and now I'm syncing my bookmarks
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.060]   across my computers, just using Chrome.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:11.020]   'Cause X-Mocks was closing down, but then it got bought
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.180]   'cause I was using that for a bit.
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:15.260]   Anyway, I just need to just start using InstaPaper more
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.420]   because everyone seems to love it.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.500]   I just haven't been able to--
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.300]   I just have that InstaPaper bookmark on my browser
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.500]   and how often do you get to a page where you really want
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.620]   to read it but it's gonna be a fairly long blog post,
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:29.860]   often yours or Jeff's and people like Fred Davis
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.780]   and not Fred Davis, Fred Wilson.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.620]   - Wilson, right.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.600]   - And I know I really want to read this,
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:37.460]   Bruce Sterling just had a really good one on Wiki leaks
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.460]   and so I'll just press that bookmark
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.500]   and it doesn't even pop up in a window or anything,
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.820]   it just goes saved.
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.260]   (laughs)
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.100]   Love that.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.740]   And if you set it up with InstaPaper,
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.300]   it will mail it to your Kindle.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.380]   - That's really cool.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.380]   - It's not free but it's nice.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.300]   - Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.860]   I have a very long read it later list
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:56.500]   and I actually think that that is gonna be the reason
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.620]   why I get a tablet.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.540]   It's just like I take the tablet and then just browse
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.700]   while I'm on the go.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:01.540]   - It's perfect for that.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.380]   - I don't have a Kindle anymore.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:03.220]   - Yeah.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.060]   - Perfect for that.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:06.700]   - So if I put InstaPaper on my Galaxy tab,
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.020]   it'll just sink and be right there, huh?
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:09.860]   Offline reading.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:10.980]   - InstaPaper haven't underrated?
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.540]   - Well, I think this is the reason why
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:14.780]   it didn't quite switch to InstaPaper entirely.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.820]   They don't feel like there's,
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.340]   and actually I wanted to ask you about it Leo.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.780]   If there's, I don't know if there's an official InstaPaper app
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.180]   or if any of the unofficial ones are any good.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.780]   - Now you got me because I realize it's iOS
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.300]   that I read InstaPaper on.
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.500]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.300]   - Let me see which ones I have installed on my.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.860]   That's a very good question.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:35.060]   InstaPaper, Marco Arment's product
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:40.060]   deserves a Nobel Prize or something.
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:41.780]   - Doesn't look like it.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:46.780]   - There's other apps working around it.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.060]   - Yeah, there's a few other ones, right?
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.980]   Ever Paper, InstaPetch.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:52.220]   This is what me hesitate.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.300]   This is why I never switched totally to InstaPapers
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.540]   that I didn't feel like I could get it on my XS1
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.500]   and feel good about it.
[00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.340]   - You're right.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.820]   I mean, I use the, there's a, you know,
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.860]   you can add it to the,
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.620]   one of the nice things about Android is you can add
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.540]   to the Share, there's a built-in Share bookmark
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.540]   on the browser and you can add arbitrarily
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.980]   anything you want to it.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.820]   - Yes.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.540]   - You can at least bookmark it.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.540]   - Yeah, read it later, I could do that with.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.380]   - Right.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.460]   - You're right.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.300]   Interesting.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.380]   Chatroom, no solution on that one.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.780]   Huh.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.700]   That's where, that's keeping the Kindle alive for me.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.700]   It's really handy.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.580]   - Can I read it in my Kindle app?
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.780]   - Well, I guess that's the next question.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.540]   I could just set up how you have it, Leo,
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.180]   and just read it in the Kindle app on Android.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.940]   - I don't know.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:34.780]   That's not--
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.260]   - 'Cause the Kindle app on Android was a little limited
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.300]   at first, but they just released a series of updates
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.740]   with more functionality.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.580]   So--
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.420]   - Including magazines and newspapers.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.700]   - Yeah, big update.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.220]   So that might be the solution.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:50.700]   Who'd have thought that Kindle would be where it is?
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:51.540]   It's really true.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.820]   It's so true what you said, Leo.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.780]   - I would have never, if you'd asked me last year,
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.100]   will you be, I would have thought,
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.620]   oh no, the iPad's gonna completely eclipse it, it's over.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.460]   In fact, I think I said that many a time.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.300]   Stupid.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.580]   - It's 'cause it runs on everything too.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.420]   I mean, because it runs on Android and iOS.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.500]   - And great battery life for the Kindle device,
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.540]   and they got it down to $139.
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.660]   - I'm convinced that's the real reason Kindle's still alive
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.780]   and why they sell so many.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:14.660]   But Barnes and Note, you know,
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.540]   Kindle, Amazon said, "Kindles are best selling product ever."
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.140]   Then Barnes and Note will say, "Hey, guess what?
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.740]   "The nooks are best selling product ever."
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:22.580]   But maybe that's 'cause they don't sell anything else.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.900]   - You know what, there's one that doesn't work.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:28.540]   Because there's 200,000 books of different titles.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:31.380]   Books are their best selling product ever.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.380]   But any one title is not gonna sell as many
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.620]   as their only reader.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.300]   - The long tail and aggregate.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.380]   All right, we're gonna take a break,
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.660]   and we're gonna come back with more Jeff Jarvis,
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.060]   Gina Tappani, Leo Le Porte, talking about Google,
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.660]   the cloud.
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.740]   Mitch, if you're listening, I don't know what happened.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.860]   We couldn't reach it.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.140]   - He thought it was tomorrow.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.180]   He feels terrible.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.260]   - Oh, so he did, okay, good.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.100]   - All right.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.620]   - Well, I feel terrible.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.460]   - Next time.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.060]   - Let's all, yeah, we'll get him on.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:56.900]   - Yeah.
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:57.780]   - Gina was one of "Felt Terrible."
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.900]   That's why we were gonna get Mitch on.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.420]   But Gina's back, she's with us, she's alive!
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.500]   - I am, I am, and I don't sound like Marge Simpson.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.020]   Too much.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.220]   - We're glad you're here, Gina.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.100]   Let me talk a little bit about our friends at Carbonite.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.140]   If you can go have a hack, coughing fit, if you wish,
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.140]   while I talk.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.780]   (laughing)
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.260]   Carbonite, don't cough!
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.300]   Carbonite!
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.620]   Carbonite is back up done right.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.780]   This is the time of year when you know you're,
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.940]   you've got a lot of stuff on your hard drive.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.060]   Pictures from the holidays, family pictures,
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.820]   that kind of thing, maybe music you downloaded,
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.660]   videos you made, and you really wanna back those up.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.980]   PC or Mac,
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:38.060]   Carbonite makes it safe, easy, and automatic.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.180]   So you don't have to think about it.
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.180]   You could try it free.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:44.420]   For two weeks, just go to carbonite.com/twig.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.340]   Your files are encrypted during transmission,
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.700]   so the idea of carbonite is you put it on your computer.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.060]   It automatically starts backing up
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.260]   anytime you're online, without slowing your system
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.620]   or you're in an access.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.860]   It automatically starts backing up
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.900]   anytime you're online.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.500]   Using 128 bit SSL, and that's important, why?
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.340]   Well, if you're at Starbucks, an open access point,
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.020]   or somewhere like that, the backup's gonna go on,
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:10.340]   you don't want anybody to watch your data go to the cloud,
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.780]   so it encrypts it and sends it to the cloud.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.780]   You could further encrypt it
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:15.260]   using triple desk or blowfish if you want as well,
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.860]   for absolute privacy.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.660]   Now here's the beauty of it.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.940]   All that data that's backed up,
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.740]   you can get to it anytime from anywhere.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.020]   You log into your carbonite account on any computer
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.460]   or the iPhone app or the BlackBerry app.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.180]   There's your data.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.380]   So it's always available to you from the cloud.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.940]   Those apps are free, by the way.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.100]   (mumbles)
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.860]   $55 a year is the normal cost,
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.540]   that's about 15 cents a day.
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.740]   Now that's for unlimited,
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.260]   that you don't measure the amount of data used,
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.700]   but it's just gotta be the personal data on your hard drive
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.940]   and you're an internal hard drive.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.420]   You can't just plug in a bunch of drives every day
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.660]   and back all of that up.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.060]   It's the internal hard drive.
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.220]   $55 a year, you can get two months free
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.260]   if you use our offer code Twig.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.980]   So try, please try it first.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.540]   It is dependent on high speed internet.
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.500]   You gotta have a good broadband access.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.620]   It's great for a student though,
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.020]   because students are always moving around
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.620]   different access points at the library.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.980]   That's why I put it on Abby's computer
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.780]   when she took it to college.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.260]   And you know, you don't wanna have to think about backin' up.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.180]   You just wanted to do it.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.340]   If you use the offer code Twig,
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.840]   you'll save two months.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.380]   Two months free.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.860]   Carbonite.com, offer code Twig.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.060]   Back it up to get it back,
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:31.860]   and do it right with carbonite.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.500]   So I've got my CR48.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.100]   Oh boo hoo hoo hoo.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.380]   Oh no, no boo hoo hoo.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:41.660]   It's a, you don't need that.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.660]   Did you get one, Gina? I forgot.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.740]   I did get one.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.580]   And I feel like--
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:46.420]   You still use it though.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.500]   Terrible, terrible tester.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.300]   Well, you know, I was traveling over the holidays
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.580]   for several, you know, few weeks, two and a half weeks.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.100]   And you know, we had to do the show.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.700]   So I, and actually we wound up doing it on Google Talk.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.460]   So I could've done it for this year, '48,
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.460]   but I just couldn't justify bringing two laptops.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:04.220]   And, honestly, since then, I haven't been a very good tester.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.660]   I just haven't picked it up again.
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:07.060]   I just, I'm doing a lot of development,
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.060]   and I need a clip.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.860]   It's a little, I'd be better than her.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.340]   Yeah, I was gonna say.
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.180]   You know what, Jeff?
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.020]   Jeff, with your better tester.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.220]   I will send you mine.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.060]   No, no, no, no.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.060]   I will.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:16.900]   I don't use it.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.740]   I will send you mine.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.580]   We'll pack it up.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.420]   We'll send it over to you.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.740]   Here's what Google said when they send it to you.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.300]   They said, you can send it back if you want,
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.140]   or you can keep it.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.300]   You do whatever you want with it.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.420]   So, normally I would not keep it.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.260]   I would send it back.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.620]   In this case, I think it's appropriate to send it to you, Jeff,
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.180]   so that you can get a sense of it.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.540]   So, you just need no use for it?
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.820]   The reason I want to use it is to think about things like,
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.060]   'cause we require every student here to buy a Mac laptop.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.660]   Macbook Air, you should make them get an 11-inch Air.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.100]   And, although it's strong enough to do video,
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:46.940]   and all the input.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:47.780]   It just doesn't have a lot of,
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.860]   it's plenty of horsepower.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.300]   It just doesn't have a lot of storage,
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.900]   so they'd have to buy an external drive or war.
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.740]   They do anyway.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.580]   They do anyway.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.580]   Or use a cloud.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.660]   But that's the question.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.020]   'Cause at some point, do we switch to pure cloud tools?
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:03.140]   I guess my attitude is that you can do everything
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:06.140]   that you can do on a CR48 with any notebook,
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.980]   as long as you're running Chrome.
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.820]   So, it's really the question,
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.540]   and we talked about this, so I'm not gonna rehash this,
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.900]   but the question is, is this gonna be free?
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.300]   What is gonna be the selling point?
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.820]   Well, I do not go to that for a second,
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.060]   'cause I think we discussed,
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.260]   well, we didn't discuss last week.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.500]   We didn't have a last week.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.100]   No, we were in the best health mode.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:26.140]   The report of the new chipset for Android
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:29.220]   that can bring the unsubsidized price of an Android phone
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.580]   down to $75.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:31.940]   Uh-huh.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.860]   And so, if you tie that to, you know,
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.740]   an incredibly cheap Chrome laptop,
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:41.420]   and look at connectivity, the world around,
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.260]   that really changes.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:44.020]   One of the things on the list here is that Eric Schmidt
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.420]   wrote a little piece, a squib for Harvard Business Review,
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:51.300]   and he said that all of Google's strategic priorities
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.060]   for 2011 are mobile.
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.620]   And he listed three things that they have to do.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:02.580]   One is work on fast networks on 4G LTE,
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.500]   which was really interesting to me
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.900]   that he said that Google had to do work on that.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.060]   Am I reading too much into that?
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:12.300]   Two was digital money,
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:17.300]   and three was cheap devices to ramp up,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.020]   oomph up distribution.
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.340]   So I still think that the Chrome thing is not for,
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.980]   you know, Gina to use to write the next great app,
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.300]   but is it the device that gets,
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.860]   is it the end of the digital divide?
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.500]   Does it get tons of people on?
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.660]   - Right.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.500]   - That's the question.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.220]   - Right, we're just not the target.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.060]   - No.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.060]   - And I accepted that.
[01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:42.580]   That's what basically, I can't remember his name,
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.820]   the product manager for as, uh,
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.180]   Chrome OS said, said, well, it's not for you.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.620]   It's not, don't compare it to a MacBook Air.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.620]   So if it's close to free or it's cheap,
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.220]   it has very good security.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.860]   I mean, that's really the big focus of it.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.420]   Everything's sandboxed, everything's secure.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.100]   You know, you even do things like, you know,
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.820]   hash the, the, the ROM and the operating system files,
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.700]   and if there's a modification, you protect it.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.020]   I mean, it's good.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.780]   I mean, they're really thinking of security first.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.140]   Maybe they're, but it's gotta be cheap
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:11.580]   'cause you really do give up a lot.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.980]   Now the, the, the story that's leading to this is that
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.580]   the Chrome Web Store, Jason,
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:19.620]   Kincaid on TechCrunch did some calculations based,
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.420]   Google's, Google's a little too open, I guess,
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:26.820]   on the, on the top grossing apps on here and so forth.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.700]   So he, so he, and by the way, you get the Chrome Web Store
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:31.820]   on every version of Chrome no matter what your platform.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:36.300]   So it's not like this is just CR48 users.
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.260]   This is, this is all of us.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.860]   But let me give you some of Jason's calculations
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:45.260]   and it's kind of, essentially it seems like interest
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.420]   and this has dropped off rapidly since the CR48.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.300]   - Yeah, but isn't that, let's give the numbers first.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.220]   - I think it's a little unfair.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.780]   - No, these, these aren't your numbers.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.620]   - No, they're not.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.460]   - Okay.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.460]   - So the number one application based on downloads
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.180]   over the past week, according to Jason,
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:01.180]   is on slot arena, medieval war game sounds good.
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.700]   I, I'm gonna go get this.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:06.780]   Five bucks, but it's had 1294 installs,
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:11.780]   total of 5,000 users, so a gross of $25,000 minus the
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.020]   2600 bucks in Google transaction fees
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.620]   since the store launched in December.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.540]   It's okay, not bad.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.940]   But then he says there's a big drop off to number two.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:24.420]   The number two application, Wordico,
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.980]   which is a kind of a scrabble game,
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.340]   four into two downloads this week,
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:32.340]   a hundred, 1,457 users, $3 app, total gross over,
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.700]   since December, $4,356.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:39.260]   Number three, Brainpop, $1,000, the fifth most popular,
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:41.220]   fifth number five on the Chrome store,
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.340]   a real solitaire, a mere 406 users.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.840]   They made 800 bucks.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.660]   Most of the top 11 applications,
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.280]   less than fewer than a hundred downloads.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.100]   - But are we really surprised by that?
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.980]   I don't think anyone I know knows
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.460]   that there is a Chrome store.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.420]   It hasn't been promoted.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.660]   There isn't a lot there.
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:04.660]   - I guess you're right.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.140]   - You know, I know I'll be fanboy again,
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.980]   but I think I got to defend them on this one
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.860]   because I don't think it's there to be successful yet.
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.660]   It's there to start to put a place in the ground
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.500]   and understand how it works.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:22.500]   And then if, you know, HTML5 finally takes over the world
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.140]   and people start using more and more web apps
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.700]   and the Chrome the OS comes out,
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.340]   then maybe it'll be different.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.020]   I think the other thing that's gonna happen is
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:36.020]   tomorrow reports are on the sixth Apple will open
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.460]   for developers, it's App Store.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.820]   And so Google just got out a little bit earlier.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.380]   So I can say we were first and we'll see
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.380]   how much Apple promotes it
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.660]   and then whether Google comes back in
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.740]   and promotes it equally.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.940]   - Right.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:51.460]   I don't know if the paid version has ads,
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:56.060]   but that amount of money does not account for ads.
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.860]   So maybe you make a little bit more money in ads.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.260]   I don't know what I'm doing here.
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.500]   - I think it's just first for bragging rights.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.660]   That's all.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:03.500]   - Yeah.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.340]   - And I'll be interested to see,
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.700]   the Mac App Store is gonna do as well on the desktop.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.700]   - Oh, the Mac App Store is gonna do better.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.700]   Are you kidding?
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.540]   - Yeah.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.420]   - The Mac App Store is gonna be totally dominant.
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.180]   And it's bad news for developers because if you do,
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:19.420]   let's say you wanna do a demo version of your game
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.340]   or a beta of your program,
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:22.260]   you're not gonna be able to
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.340]   'cause Apple won't approve it.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.820]   You're gonna be,
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.460]   it's gonna severely limit what happens.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.700]   - Well, that's a really good point.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.620]   The beta problem, yeah.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:30.460]   - Yeah.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.620]   And Apple's gonna, because users are gonna love it.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.340]   - That's what I-
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.780]   - Well, because you're gonna get a brand new Mac
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.020]   and it's gonna be the first thing that launches
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.180]   when you start it up.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.020]   - Right.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:40.860]   - Right.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:41.700]   - I mean, that-
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.540]   - And it's security,
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.700]   you don't have to worry about automatic updates.
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.860]   It's very much like iOS, right?
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.540]   - Right, right.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:48.380]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.780]   You said that the new version of Four Square,
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:50.820]   which I've been, for Android,
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:51.820]   which I'm really enjoying,
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:54.020]   it supports comments and photos.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.260]   I follow Dennis Crowley and he had mentioned the early beta
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:58.620]   before it was in the market.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.460]   - Yeah.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.500]   - And I downloaded it and he actually talked about
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.580]   how that was so helpful to have people
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.500]   kind of crowdsourcing beta testing
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.220]   before that they released it in the market.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:11.180]   I think I'm still actually running the early
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.140]   kind of beta version.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.660]   - It's how we do business these days
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:17.140]   of web development is fast iteration.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.500]   So, and that's why I like Android over Apple
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:24.500]   because Apple's iPhone store slows iterations down.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.020]   You don't get updates as fast Android.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.300]   Sometimes you get daily updates.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.620]   Thank goodness they added the automatic update
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:30.460]   'cause I don't know about it.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.660]   - Thank goodness for update all.
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:32.620]   - Yeah, well, update all,
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.140]   but even now, if you check that box,
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.900]   it'll automatically do it on most of us.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:36.900]   - Yes.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.500]   - Unless they make a big change in permissions.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.460]   And that's kind of cool too
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.460]   'cause I'll wake up in the morning
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.180]   and look, four apps are automatically updated.
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:43.020]   I love that.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.860]   And I'm sure developers like the fact
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.700]   that they can iterate without permission.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.380]   But that's gone in the Apple model.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.260]   You have to get approved.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:57.020]   - You know, Leo, when I started working
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.340]   for advanced publications,
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:01.300]   which Connie asked back in 1994.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.500]   And the browser just been released.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.300]   My first task there was to work on something
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.060]   called the India Journal, just a moment's story,
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.060]   where we found all the old computers
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.300]   that were around with big old five inch disks
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.580]   and got them out in the community
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:19.540]   and set up a bulletin board back at the offices
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.580]   and an editor named Sri Ram Krishna Swami
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.020]   would get reports from the community.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.660]   - Very early citizen journalism.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:27.500]   - Really?
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.820]   - And he put out a daily newspaper
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.780]   that went out on the vertical blanking interval
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.260]   the NBC TV spill.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.220]   - This must have been '94.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.700]   - '94, '94.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:37.540]   - Okay.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.620]   - It was done by MIT Media Lab.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:39.460]   - So cool.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.300]   - It worked, I mean.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:43.980]   And it went into a TV antenna
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:47.780]   at the Shivam, Delhi and Newark Avenue in Jersey City.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.100]   And there was a big red button,
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.380]   MIT and Cisco, the big red button,
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:51.220]   people would hit the button
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.940]   and that would prop the latest issue.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:53.820]   - Awesome.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.140]   - So we did all that stuff, right?
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.300]   So now imagine that if you could buy
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.100]   a bunch of devices in bulk and give them out,
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.220]   what all could you do, right?
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.860]   So journalistically, could I empower a community
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.340]   to report on itself?
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.700]   Educationally, could you really take a school
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:10.580]   and eliminate textbooks?
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.820]   - So that's what Chrome OS,
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.900]   that's what you're saying for Chrome OS.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.460]   - That's what I think is the power here.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.300]   - Yes, I agree.
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.820]   - It's like peanut and Android.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.740]   And the thing you're gonna do starting tomorrow
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.940]   is look for devices besides tablets and phones
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.820]   that have Android.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.660]   - Yep.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:23.500]   - Same here.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.060]   What are the uses besides geeks on PCs
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.380]   that if you have cheap devices
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.020]   that you could buy in bulk and give out in bulk,
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.940]   ad supported, educational, charitable, whatever,
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.420]   what's possible?
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.940]   Now, will people have,
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.300]   will everybody have computers anyway?
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.900]   And it's ridiculous?
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.180]   Yeah, eventually they would.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.060]   They have cell phones and cell phones are expensive,
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.100]   but they got them 'cause it's important.
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.300]   But I just think that there's uses for these things
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:55.180]   that potentially are big or I'm full of crap.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.780]   - No, but I think no, I like this
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.660]   and I think Google thinks big like this.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.180]   So this is the, I mean, I wouldn't say that,
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.580]   I wouldn't say Microsoft's gonna ever do that credibly
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.940]   or Apple's ever gonna do that credibly.
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.820]   - Well, Microsoft was, they fought the one laptop per child.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.900]   - Right. - They've translated it too.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.460]   - That's right.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.100]   And so, yeah, and again, don't think this is,
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.140]   the Chrome is for the US.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.340]   - Right. - If you think about Chrome for Africa,
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:20.260]   Chrome for Brazil.
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.100]   - Right.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100]   - Makes a lot of sense.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.180]   - It's really powerful.
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.620]   - And frankly, more practical than the one laptop per child,
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.620]   which had a very kind of funky, small talk based interface
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.580]   and sugar and all of that.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.660]   And this is just, you know, it's a browser.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.660]   I think everybody knows how to use it.
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:38.580]   Eric Schmidt does in fact say that all of Google's
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:41.120]   strategic initiatives these days are mobile.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.260]   Now wonder they promoted Marissa Meyer.
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:47.220]   - Yeah, I'd say that should, that should vindicate her
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.620]   for that being a motion.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.460]   - Yeah.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:55.220]   This is at Harvard Business Review.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:57.460]   He's writing, "Preparing for the big mobile revolution."
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.500]   As I think about Google's strategic initiatives
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.100]   in 2011, right, Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google,
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:06.420]   I realize that they're all about mobile.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:11.820]   We're at the point where between geolocation capability
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.900]   of the phone and the power of the phone's browser platform,
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.260]   it's possible to deliver personalized information
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.380]   about where you are, what you could do there right now
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:21.220]   and so forth and deliver such a service at scale.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.340]   But to realize that vision,
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:26.140]   Google needs to do some serious spade work on three fronts.
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.900]   You must focus on developing the underlying fast networks.
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.780]   He's talking about three G networks.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.860]   - And stop there.
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.340]   Google must focus on this.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.580]   - Well that explains maybe the deal with Verizon, right?
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:38.420]   - Doesn't it?
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:41.100]   - Yeah, for net neutrality, the quote net neutrality deal.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.180]   - In net neutrality.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.020]   - Yeah.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.900]   Second, we must attend to the development of mobile money.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.180]   Now that's the near field communications stuff
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.900]   built in the Nexus S, I would guess.
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:52.740]   Phones as we know.
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.140]   - It's not just that, it's also the back end
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.540]   to handle new currency.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.020]   That's big too.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.900]   - And this underscores what you said
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.780]   because he's looking at the third world.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.660]   He says, "Phones as we know are used as banks
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.300]   in many poorer parts of the world."
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.980]   And modern technology means their use
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.860]   as financial tools can go further than that.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.460]   Third, and this again is what you were talking about,
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.940]   we want to increase the availability
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.460]   of inexpensive smartphones in the poorest parts of the world.
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.860]   Notice he doesn't say laptops, he says smartphones,
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:23.700]   but that makes sense.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.540]   That's what a smartphone is.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.460]   It's a small computer.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.940]   We envision literally a billion people getting
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:32.380]   inexpensive browser based touchscreen phones
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.380]   over the next few years.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:37.000]   So really, Chrome OS isn't about a CR48.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.900]   It's about a phone.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.020]   - Browser based touchscreen phone, that's interesting.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.780]   - Now didn't he say that Android for touch,
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:47.340]   Chrome OS for laptops?
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:48.580]   - He had said that.
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:49.420]   - Yeah, the answer.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:53.700]   - A browser based touchscreen phone sounds like Chrome OS.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.380]   It kinda does.
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.220]   - Yeah.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.860]   - Maybe we will see the full Chrome on Android,
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.140]   you know, other than the next few versions.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.060]   - Or maybe Eric's just blowing smoke as he.
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.100]   (laughing)
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:06.940]   I love Eric.
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:10.620]   Eric's the best CEO 'cause, you know, he's just saying anything.
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.860]   - Well, you know, when I interviewed him for the book,
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:18.940]   it was funny, he was quite growly about the reaction he gets
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:21.820]   and about the horrible video on Times Square.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.020]   I don't know if I said this on the show before,
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.820]   but he called it Death by Twitter.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:25.900]   - Ooh.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.380]   - And he said that, you know, you say that one line somewhere
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:31.300]   and that's all that gets tweeted out is that one line
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.940]   and no context, nothing else is there.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.340]   And the people who wanna attack him will attack him
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.180]   shallowly.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.180]   And he emphasizes that, you know, full paragraphs
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.940]   of reaction are very good or valuable to the company.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:45.300]   But Death by Twitter, I thought was a great line.
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.900]   - But you know, there's also Life by Twitter.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.020]   A lot of people will quote smart things that you say.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.580]   I mean, I see Steve Jobs quotes.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.180]   I mean, not to, I mean, around all the time.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:58.180]   - If you use it properly, it could be very valuable.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:59.940]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, he shouldn't have to reduce
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.900]   his message down to a sound bite every time,
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:03.820]   but you know, actually maybe he should.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.260]   - Well, but see, I think an article like this
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:09.020]   in the Harvard Business Review then gets retweeted
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.340]   and put out, how did I learn about it?
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:11.780]   Probably from Twitter.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.860]   - His last tweet was December 11.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:16.620]   - See, you're missing the boat, Eric.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.020]   Dood.
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:18.860]   Dood.
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.540]   - We need to get him and cut to Cory Booker.
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:23.820]   You know who's not missing the boat?
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.860]   John Boehner and the GOP, they're gonna stream
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:30.180]   the opening session on Facebook.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:34.620]   Wow, talk about getting it.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.300]   - Question is, will he cry?
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.540]   (laughing)
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.460]   - I mean, I have to say, you know,
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:45.180]   Boehner is also the one who wants to change the rules
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:49.820]   in Congress to allow computers, phones and so forth
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:51.700]   tweeting from the house floor.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:55.540]   And I have to say, you know, I think probably
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:59.100]   because of my left coast liberal leanings,
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:03.060]   I don't always think of the GOP as the party of technology,
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.860]   but boy, you know, they seem to understand
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.620]   a little bit better at this point.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:12.780]   The 112th Congress will, yeah, you could watch it
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.580]   on C-SPAN, but you could also watch it
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:19.340]   on the Pledge to America Facebook page.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.180]   - Hey, that's great.
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.180]   However, however, he engages citizens.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:25.780]   He's in social media, engaged citizens is a great thing.
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.620]   - The GOP leaders are billing it as a down payment
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.700]   on a new era of governing in the public eye
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.580]   through web and not-enabled technology.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.420]   - Awesome.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:36.060]   - Right on, yeah.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.860]   Nick Schaper, we gotta get him on.
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.900]   He's a digital media advisor to John Boehner,
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:42.260]   said this will mark the first time
[01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.900]   that the opening session of Congress
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.500]   has been streamed live on Facebook.
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:49.780]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:52.260]   I guess is it going on right now?
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.260]   - Might be.
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.660]   - Let me see.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.260]   - Or link.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.740]   - Yeah, I think it is.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.820]   Click to watch.
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:04.300]   You can go to this by going to Facebook.com/pledge to America.
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:08.340]   And they're using livestream.com for this.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.500]   Oh, looks like it's over.
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.700]   - Thanks for-
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:13.540]   - That's great.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:17.700]   - So, press secretary uses Twitter to gather first questions
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.700]   from the public to answer-
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:19.540]   - Robert Gibbs?
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.780]   - Yeah, Robert Gibbs.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.780]   - Yep.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.660]   I'd say this is fantastic.
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.380]   Go to where the people are.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.100]   - Well, C-SPAN was the beginning of all this,
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.700]   where you could actually tune in C-SPAN
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.580]   anytime in the day or night and watch stuff.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.500]   And smart members of Congress really started
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.780]   to take advantage of that, you know,
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.860]   using the comments sessions.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:41.660]   I remember this, who was it that was giving long speeches
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.260]   to an empty house?
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.860]   But you didn't know 'cause the C-SPAN cameras
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:46.180]   were pointing at him.
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.020]   - Right.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:51.620]   - And of course Obama was very effective.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.860]   Actually, Obama disappointed because I think he was
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.220]   very effective at using social media to get elected
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.140]   and then didn't seem to really want to use it after the fact.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:00.500]   - Yeah, and I think that's the issue.
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:03.100]   And the same was true in the UK with a camera
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:08.100]   and I asked his social media person back early on
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.420]   when he was making videos,
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:11.180]   "Will this continue when he gets an office?"
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.700]   And he said, "Oh, if it didn't,
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.540]   "this would be rather cynical that we're doing it now."
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.020]   Well, turns out to be rather cynical
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.340]   that they're doing it now because it doesn't continue
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.260]   once in office.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:24.460]   And I know Beth Novick,
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:27.380]   who's the head of the transparency effort at the White House
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.780]   and the need to get things vetted by lawyers
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.980]   is a constant issue.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:33.820]   - Yeah.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.820]   - I mean, that's the problem.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.340]   - It's the take my Blackberry problem.
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:40.660]   - And you're a lot closer to all this than I am.
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:44.060]   - Yeah, I mean, they're using ThinkUp
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.540]   and I actually got to meet with the new media team
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.700]   at the White House and I actually think
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.420]   that they're doing a lot of really cool stuff.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.500]   I think first question is a really good example.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.740]   I mean, President Obama did it,
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.940]   it gets better video during the teen gay suicide.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:55.780]   - Is he really?
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.620]   - I didn't know that.
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:58.580]   - I mean, he's like an internet meme.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.420]   - Good for him.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.340]   - Which was amazing.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.180]   I mean, when I saw that video,
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.460]   I was just floored and then they released
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:06.620]   sort of a montage of White House staff doing that.
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:08.540]   You know, WhiteHouse.gov has been really,
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.220]   has been very active.
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:11.060]   - I don't know.
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:13.860]   I've actually been, like I said, I'm close to this.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.380]   - I'm not wrong that the perception's there
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:16.380]   that he's not using it.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:17.420]   So why is that?
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:21.500]   Is it all just smoking errors?
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.340]   Is it perception?
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:25.020]   - I mean, I think I'm pretty close to this.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.860]   So I actually, I was surprised to hear you say that.
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:27.700]   I didn't think that that was--
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.580]   - I don't think I'm alone though in that perception.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.340]   Maybe I am, maybe it's just me.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.460]   - Chat room.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.620]   (laughing)
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.460]   - And Neil Dash writing in his blog
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.700]   a couple of days ago, there are three's a trend,
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.660]   the decline of Google search quality.
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.180]   And I've started to see this talk about a meme.
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:48.700]   I've started to see this meme circulate a little bit
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:49.540]   around the internet.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:52.700]   He quotes Paul Kedrowski writing,
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:55.100]   Google has become a snake.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:58.300]   The two readily consumes its own keyword tale.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:02.180]   Alan Patrick on the increasing uselessness of Google.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.980]   Google's like a monoculture.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:07.620]   Thus parasites have a major impact once they adapted to it.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.020]   And finally-- - And blaming Google
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.100]   for spammers and stuff.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.620]   - Yes.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.140]   Jeff Atwood trouble in the house of Google.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.940]   I can't help noticing we're not the only site
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.780]   to have serious problems with Google search results
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:20.740]   in the last few months, he says.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:25.260]   Is this perception?
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.380]   Is this the case?
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:27.700]   It's anecdotal obviously.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.260]   And then Neil points that out.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:30.900]   - You know, it's like the other stuff we have on the list.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.660]   I just, I'm so sick of people
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.260]   and McLaren things dead and over.
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:37.140]   - Oh, I didn't even bother with the RSS dead meme
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:40.220]   which is coming on and is back again.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.100]   - Oh, it's ridiculous. - Every two years.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.100]   Every year.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.340]   - You know what, I blame bloggers
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.260]   because they look for a snappy SEO headline
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.980]   and declaring something dead is a lot better
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.860]   for a headline than saying, well, it's less interesting.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:56.020]   (laughing)
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:56.860]   - Exactly.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.180]   - Who's gonna read that?
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.380]   - And you know, there are certain characters
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.540]   who do it all the time and it's just so irritating.
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:04.820]   So to say, listen,
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:08.300]   Matt Cutz has a hell of a job, right?
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:12.220]   Because the evil doers are always gonna be a step ahead of him.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.420]   - And so he's the guy who works at Google for a web spam.
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.020]   - Right, and so I think that he does a very good job
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.060]   of trying to get rid of web spam,
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.180]   but he's always gonna be a step behind.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.700]   That's one issue.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.380]   And that's kind of what they're talking about in those posts.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.940]   The other question is,
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:27.540]   and Marissa Meyer just talked about this
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.940]   in an interview she just did,
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:31.220]   new mechanisms of discovery.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.260]   That's a different question.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.940]   That's a question of making a leap ahead.
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.780]   - Right.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:38.620]   - So is Quora or Bing
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:42.220]   or that other search engine better than Google or not?
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.260]   That's an incremental question.
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.940]   There is a strategic question,
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.900]   which I have to believe Google's working on.
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:50.100]   Could they blow it the way they have things like Buzz?
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.060]   Sure.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:53.900]   And boy, do I piss off people when I dare criticize Buzz.
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:54.740]   That's gonna get me right now.
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:55.820]   - Well, the good news is,
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:59.180]   you're only about 100 people left to credit to be mad at you.
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.740]   - Oh, they're vocal.
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:01.580]   They're vocal.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.580]   - They're vocal, but I'm not kidding.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.580]   It's 100 people.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:04.420]   It's not.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.260]   - Jesus.
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.100]   - We're getting it real.
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:06.940]   - We're getting it real.
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.900]   - No, I challenge it.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.620]   - Guys, don't bother.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:11.580]   Buzz is dead.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.500]   I'm not gonna read Buzz.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.340]   I don't care.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.180]   - Nobody denies it.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.020]   Nobody screws it.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.180]   - No, Buzz.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.020]   Okay.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:17.860]   - Apparently.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:18.860]   - I don't like Buzz.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:19.700]   I don't like it.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.540]   You know why I don't like it?
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.520]   Because I don't like you,
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.900]   Buzzo's there,
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:26.220]   who are like a bunch of school army craft heads,
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.780]   who all they do is talking about
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:29.220]   how you should properly use Buzz.
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.060]   Well, screw you.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:30.900]   - Thank you very much.
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.540]   - You know, I kind of agree with you.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.340]   - Best of 2011, right there.
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   - We are taking notes this time
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:38.580]   at the beginning of the year
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:40.380]   for the end of the year, best of.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.020]   And there's one right there.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:42.860]   - Sorry.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.620]   - And by the way, you'll probably be vindicated.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:46.100]   I've really had high hopes for Buzz.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.180]   You know what I'm wondering now?
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:50.460]   And I notice this seems to be a trend
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:52.260]   because I had high hopes for Chico.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.580]   I had high hopes for Pounce.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.940]   All of the Twitter--
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.780]   - Your order, Jake's.
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.620]   - It's my fault.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.460]   No, I think it's because--
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:58.660]   - Welcome to my world, too.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.380]   - I liked,
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.220]   well, yeah,
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.060]   and wave.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.020]   I liked the conversation,
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.020]   but it turns out,
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.940]   I don't think anybody wants the conversation.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.980]   So Twitter continues to win
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.660]   because there is no real conversation on Twitter.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.340]   And all of these Twitter clones
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.500]   that involved threaded conversations.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.540]   And I think the same thing's gonna happen to Quora,
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:21.100]   quickly lost their appeal
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.220]   because nobody really wanted it.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.060]   Except for those 100 people.
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:25.500]   - Well, because of our obligation, right?
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:28.020]   It's an overload problem.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:28.860]   And--
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:29.700]   - That's definitely part of it.
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:30.860]   - People wanted a broadcast.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.940]   They wanted RSS.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:34.780]   - Yeah.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.820]   - Rightly.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:37.100]   They didn't wanna have a conversation,
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.180]   you don't have a conversation with your RSS feed.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.820]   You don't have a conversation with Twitter, really?
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:43.860]   - You can, but actually that irritates people.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.980]   I got into a--
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:45.820]   - Yes.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.540]   - About the Oprah network this weekend.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.740]   - That was epic, Jeff.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:50.180]   - What do you think of own?
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:54.700]   - I was like, I'm gonna build a think-a-plugin
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.580]   just to accommodate this own thread
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:58.580]   that Jeff started
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.420]   because it's so interesting, complex,
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:01.420]   and it's so much more interesting.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.420]   - It's so much more interesting.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:07.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.

[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:31.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:32.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.

[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:38.420]   - I'm gonna be a little bit more interested in this.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:45.420]   - I found the whole conversation that you had on Twitter this weekend.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:48.420]   - That was my reaction to it.
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.420]   - Really fascinating.
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:50.420]   I just showed a few of the tweets.
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:51.420]   And you were in there.
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:52.420]   You were firing.
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:53.420]   You did not sit back, Jeff.
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:57.420]   You just got in there and...
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.420]   - What the hay?
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.420]   - All right, let's take a break.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.420]   - See, I don't just yell here.
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:01.420]   - He yells everywhere.
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:02.420]   No, I think this is one of the...
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.420]   - I think this is one of the...
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.420]   - I think this is one of the...
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:05.420]   - I think this is one of the...
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.420]   - I think this is one of the...
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:10.420]   - I think this is one of the great democratizing things about the internet.
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:12.420]   We all get to have our opinions and have the conversation.
[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:15.420]   It's a shame that Twitter is where the conversation happens
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:17.420]   'cause it's just so hard to follow.
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:19.420]   And there are so many great conversation platforms,
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:21.420]   but apparently nobody really wants them, including Buzz.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.420]   - But, Leo, isn't that...
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:25.420]   - The issue for me is obligation.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:27.420]   So the buzzers get mad at me because, you know,
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.420]   they say, "Well, you don't ever have been on Buzz."
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.420]   They say, "Yes, I was."
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:33.420]   But then it was more things to answer and deal with.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420]   It's like Quora, right?
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.420]   More things to answer and deal with.
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:38.420]   I've got enough things to answer and deal with.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.420]   I don't mean to sound self-important and open like there,
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.420]   but, you know, we all are overloaded.
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.420]   We have no busy signal anymore.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.420]   And so to give me something that sets me up
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:50.420]   in a position of obligation...
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.420]   No, I resent.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:55.420]   Whereas Twitter come in, come out, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.420]   Who cares? You know, it's okay.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.420]   And I think that that's what makes it more appealing.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.420]   - I think you're absolutely right.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:01.420]   It's a lack.
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.420]   The no commitment part of it, dip in and dip out
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:05.420]   is definitely part of Twitter's success.
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:07.420]   - Certainly. Certainly is why I use it.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:08.420]   But I like conversation.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:11.420]   I mean, that's all I do all day, every day.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:14.420]   But maybe that's just, you know, that's not the right form.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:18.420]   And I can't imagine Quorum lasting very much longer.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:20.420]   After a while, people are just getting tired of answering questions.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.420]   - But there are those who are declaring that it's the next big thing
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:24.420]   that's going to take over Google.
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:26.420]   - It's amazing the spike that it's had recently.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:27.420]   It's been such a big deal.
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.420]   And, you know, I've seen a couple of good threads.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.420]   - It's great. - I have a question for myself.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:33.420]   I mean, you know, when I think good Q&A sites,
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.420]   I think Ask Metafilter.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:37.420]   - That's actually a great site.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.420]   Yeah. Or a great, a great future.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.420]   - Yeah. Or I would post on Facebook or Twitter and ask my friends,
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:44.420]   you know, people who I, you know, have some sort of relationship with.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:47.420]   But it is interesting that Quora, hey, it was just like you said,
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:49.420]   I think it's great to have different ways to have conversations.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.420]   And I think it's even better that you can harvest the data
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:54.420]   and get insights from it.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:57.420]   - Let us move along because we are running late.
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.420]   It is already three o'clock on the West Coast.
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:03.420]   We want to get down to CES soon.
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:05.420]   And TNT, before we do that, though,
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:08.420]   we should get our tip tool and number of the week.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.420]   Let's start with you, Gina Tripani.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:11.420]   You're a tip of the week.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:14.420]   - Tip of the week is transferring your delicious bookmarks
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:15.420]   to Google bookmarks.
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:18.420]   Now, Leo, I know you moved over to Pinboard,
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.420]   which I'm checking out.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:22.420]   And I'm actually getting lots of recommendations for InstaPaper,
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:24.420]   clients for Android as well.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:26.420]   - Oh, good. - Ben Paper and Hard Copic Pro.
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:29.420]   But Mihai Poporita, who's a Google engineer,
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.420]   wrote a little tool.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:36.420]   It's at it's delicious-export.appspot.com.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:38.420]   You enter your delicious username and password,
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:41.420]   and it will move your delicious bookmarks into Google.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.420]   And actually, the one thing that Chrome OS has done for me
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:45.420]   is I am basically full-time Chrome at this point.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:48.420]   And the really nice feature is the synchronizing bookmarks
[01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.420]   across all your machines, no extra toolbars, you know,
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.420]   it required.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:54.420]   So if you were to keep your bookmarks in delicious
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.420]   and looking for an alternative,
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:57.420]   just want to go back over to Google.
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:59.420]   This tool will help you do that.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.420]   - Does Google bookmarks have that functionality?
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:03.420]   - That's a real question. - Yeah, maybe we should use
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:05.420]   B using that.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:07.420]   - Which functionality, the tagging?
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:08.420]   - Well, just all that.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.420]   I mean, you know what we use delicious for.
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.420]   - Yeah, no, it doesn't quite have all the functionality
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:14.420]   that that's delicious. - It's just saving them.
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:15.420]   - It's just saving them.
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:19.420]   And I'm not sure if this export tool will actually create
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.420]   the tags as folders or what it actually does with the tags.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:24.420]   But if you're just bookmarking, you know,
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.420]   if you're using delicious more as a bookmarking bookmarks,
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:29.420]   bookmarking tool, just to save URLs versus publisher share,
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:32.420]   I think Google bookmarks is just fine.
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:35.420]   But it is the kind of old school folder system versus tags.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.420]   - All right.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.420]   I'm still going to do the import because then at least it will
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:40.420]   save all of that, which is kind of cool.
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:41.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:42.420]   But Pinboard also great.
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:45.420]   And I know Mache and I think I love his business model as well.
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:46.420]   - Yeah, I do too.
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.420]   You know him, I didn't know you knew him.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.420]   We had him on net at night the other day.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.420]   - Yeah, and not him briefly, a few years back.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.420]   Yeah, smart guy.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.420]   - Of course, I just tried to use this tool and I guess
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:56.420]   we've broken it.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:57.420]   - Uh oh.
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:34:58.420]   Whoops.
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:03.420]   - Maybe they had a little few too many API calls to you.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.420]   - Yeah, check out Pinboard.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:07.420]   Sorry about the bad tip.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:08.420]   - No, no, it's not bad.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.420]   It's just temporarily.
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.420]   - Temporarily.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:11.420]   - Come back later.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.420]   - All right.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:14.420]   - Our number of the week for Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:15.420]   - 600 million.
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:18.420]   I've been waiting for this number to pop up and waiting for the case
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:21.420]   because quite a while ago Facebook said that they had 500 million
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.420]   and we've been waiting for it to go up and I checked.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:27.420]   In fact, just last week, they're info page.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:30.420]   They have a stats page and it was staying at 500 million.
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:35.420]   Well, Goldman Sachs said to its investors that it has 600 million
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:41.420]   and Goldman just said moments ago that they've cut off the offering
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.420]   for-
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:45.420]   - They've already fully subscribed on half a billion.
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:48.420]   - Way over subscribed to 1.5 billion.
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.420]   - Oh man.
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.420]   - So they have more than two billion-
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:55.420]   - There's a market demand for more than two billion dollars in Facebook stock
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:57.420]   at that valuation.
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:01.420]   Now, the background here of course is that it's not a public stock.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:06.420]   Goldman is going to invest itself, but then they'll in turn sell that off to others.
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:09.420]   It's a way to get around going public.
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.420]   - For a little bit because I think the SEC is going to start really looking.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.420]   - They're going to come in on this.
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:17.420]   But I'm thinking it's kind of brilliant because what it's done is it's shown that
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:22.420]   Facebook can go public at far north of this valuation.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:23.420]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:26.420]   - It has set an extremely high valuation.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:28.420]   - So 50 billion dollars is low.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:30.420]   - Is low.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.420]   - Oh man.
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:36.420]   And I can't believe they got to 600 million because how many people are there in?
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.420]   I mean, there's a billion internet users.
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.420]   How many are you going to be at 100% at this rate in a year or two?
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.420]   Are they growing faster than the internet?
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:47.420]   I'd say I think they must be.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:53.420]   - I think what's happening is some of the countries where other applications were stronger.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.420]   - Like Orcutt and Brazil or?
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:58.420]   - Yeah, or Stutti Foutzet in Germany.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:06.420]   I mean, the interesting one is Yuri Milner, who he invested at a valuation of 10 billion.
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:11.420]   And it's now five times that with his, I think, 500 million dollars.
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:17.420]   So he's done quite well and he owns the competitor in Russia.
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:18.420]   - Right.
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.420]   - So I don't know what's happening with Facebook and Russia, but Facebook is just really...
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:26.420]   - Well, one of the investors, the second investor with Goldman Sachs was a Russian company.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.420]   Digital...
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:28.420]   - That's Yuri Milner.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.420]   - That's Yuri.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:32.420]   - So he says, "Well, maybe I should own competition."
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.420]   - Oh, he's amazing.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.420]   I've met Yuri.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:38.420]   He is not an oligarch, but he will be one day.
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:43.420]   He has that kind of really stern Russian thing, but a very nice guy.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:45.420]   He believes... he's a very interesting investor.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:47.420]   He does not take a board seat.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:49.420]   He didn't want one.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:51.420]   He invests at a great measure.
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:57.420]   He created the liquid market that enabled employees to sell their stock and take some money off the table.
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:01.420]   And that's how he got a lot of his shares with Facebook's Blessing.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:04.420]   And he gives a lot of advice to Zuckerberg.
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:10.420]   And he believes that we ain't seen nothing yet, that artificial intelligence is indeed going to come in.
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:12.420]   And those with the most data will win.
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.420]   And that's why he loves Facebook so much.
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:15.420]   - Very interesting.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:16.420]   - Yes.
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:20.420]   - He's now big owner, big rich man.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:27.420]   My selection of the week is just something that just relatively recently came out,
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:30.420]   read about it on Life Hacker.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.420]   It's called Active Inbox.
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:41.420]   It's a free plugin that basically turns your Gmail into a "getting things done" kind of a tool.
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:51.420]   It allows you to take... they say... basically they say "email" is just a... to-do list that's hard to get to.
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:53.420]   So they're going to turn it into a to-do list.
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:59.420]   You install it, it adds, as you see on the left here, an active inbox plugin.
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:01.420]   And you can assign messages.
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.420]   It creates new labels.
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:11.420]   Traditional actually getting things done in labels like, you know, Delegate and maybe Later and so forth.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:13.420]   You can have projects.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:15.420]   You can have references.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:18.420]   Really kind of a neat addition to Gmail.
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.420]   I know, Gina, you've written some.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:21.420]   So you know a little bit about this.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.420]   This is very elegant, very slick.
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.420]   It's nicely done.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:24.420]   - Yeah.
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:26.420]   This extension used to be called GTG Inbox.
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:28.420]   It's had a couple of iterations.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:32.420]   And actually it came out... it's earlier iterations came out before Gmail had tasks built in.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:35.420]   But it does a lot more than Gmail tasks.
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:37.420]   And actually it's a great extension.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:40.420]   It's something that we've written about on Life Hacker through a few of its iterations.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:47.420]   And definitely a good addition for GTD folks who don't want to have to move their tasks out of their email
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:49.420]   into another task at manager.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:50.420]   You know, kind of builds it right in.
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:53.420]   - Emails are just badly formatted tasks.
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:55.420]   - It's really true when you think about it.
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:56.420]   - Yeah.
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:00.420]   - And the reason why I hate emails so much is because every single message represents something that I...
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:02.420]   - You have to do something about that.
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:07.420]   - Some sort of obligation or commitment that I haven't followed through on yet.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:09.420]   - Ugh, email.
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.420]   - Shh!
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:11.420]   - I know.
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:12.420]   Sorry.
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.420]   I didn't mean to give you the shivers on that.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:15.420]   - I'm going to go get on a plane where I can't be reached.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.420]   Oh no, they have air.
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.420]   Why do they put Wi-Fi in planes?
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.420]   - Thanks to Google Free Wi-Fi.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:24.420]   I don't know how long the free Wi-Fi is going on, but I had to have my flight home.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.420]   - Virgin America in about three hours.
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.420]   - Yep.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:28.420]   - I'll be tweeting.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.420]   (laughter)
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.420]   - I'm on a plane!
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:32.420]   - Probably safely.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:33.420]   I would enjoy.
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:34.420]   - Thank you so much.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.420]   - Yeah, have a great time with CES.
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.420]   - Our coverage of CES begins very soon.
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:38.420]   Everybody's down there.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:42.420]   The entire team, we have a skeleton crew up here of just a couple of people.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.420]   Everybody's down there.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:44.420]   We will have...
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:46.420]   You know, you can't get to CES.
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:51.420]   You can at least experience it on live.twit.tv starting in just a few hours.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.420]   - Oh, better way.
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:53.420]   - Yeah.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.420]   - Bonnie, thank you for being here even though you're a little under the weather.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.420]   I hope you feel better.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:59.420]   - I'm as pixellary as my health.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.420]   - This is how she feels, folks.
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:02.420]   - This is how I feel.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.420]   - How do you know?
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:04.420]   - I feel like I'm pretty cool.
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.420]   - A little pixelated.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:08.420]   - Like mostly here, but a little antibiotic.
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:10.420]   He's great to be here.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.420]   - SmartWare.org is our website.
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:13.420]   Go there right now.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:14.420]   And thank you, Gina.
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:15.420]   We'll see you.
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:16.420]   I hope you feel better next week.
