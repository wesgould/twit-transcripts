[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   No.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.840]   Well, no, actually you're on Leo.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.360]   Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   And also here, Gina Trapani of smartawear.org.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   That's her blog.

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   founding editor of Life Hacker.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   Hello, everybody.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   Hello.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.760]   Good to be here.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   So Jeff, do you leave a vacation?
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   I am.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   That's why I'm translating things into Italian.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760]   That's right.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   That's right.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   When do you leave?
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.960]   We're going to be Leo less for like two or three weeks.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.760]   Yeah, I'll leave next Tuesday and I won't be back till October 9th.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.160]   Yeah, I think my best.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   Good for you.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   Good for you.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160]   Well, Jeff and I are on the floor.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   But we're going to--
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160]   Yeah, you know, thank you.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.320]   We're hosting shows, which is wonderful in my absence.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   It's not.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.960]   But I am going to record the ads for you so that you don't have to sell your--
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   Lily, the wife's--
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   Thank you.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   --hands on commercialism and capitalism.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   You do this 300 times better than I was.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   But he has to do it 300 times.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.160]   Actually, you know what?
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.840]   Last year, when I went on vacation, I did record like-- I don't know.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   I can't remember.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040]   It was an ungodly number of ads, but we managed to cut that number down a little bit.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.840]   So that's a relief.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.680]   So Jeff, last week, we had a poll that made you open your Moto X. And I figured it's about
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.440]   a 50/50 proposition that by now you would either blame us or love us.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.240]   Or have a re-boxed--
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.640]   Or a re-box that shipped it back.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   Bingo.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   I returned it.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   You did!
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   You did!
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   Here's the rationale.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   Here's the rationale.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   I opened it.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.040]   And I used it for a couple of days.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   My 14 days was like up.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.640]   And I didn't hate it.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   Didn't love it.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.800]   Thought it was just expensive at $674 versus my Nexus 4, which I still have.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.240]   And so I thought I might want that Nexus 5.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.640]   I could be kicking myself.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.240]   What I really-- I do want a new phone.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.760]   I'm willing to pay for a new phone.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.440]   I want it to have LTE, more memory, you know, some new features and that kind of stuff.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.240]   But I wanted to wait for the Nexus 5 to--
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   I had this still a chance.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   I could buy the Moto X.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   But we compare the Nexus 5, the Moto X, and the HTC One and make a decision at that time.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   That was my rationale.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   That's fair.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   OK.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.240]   Now the other good news is my Nexus 7 with LTE arrives tomorrow.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   Yay!
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240]   Well, you could use that as your phone.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.640]   Just put Skype or something on there and hangouts.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.240]   Well, hangouts make phone calls from a tablet, from an Android device.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240]   Or only from the desktop.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.040]   It'll do from the desktop.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   Yeah, it's-- the voice has started to forward to hangouts.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   Wait.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   Let me see if I can make a phone call.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.440]   It doesn't look like I can, at least not on this phone.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   Through hangouts, though, you can do video, obviously.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   But I think--
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   But I can make a call to a phone number.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.440]   When I'm sitting at home on my desktop, I use that as my telephone call.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   I can make a phone call to a regular phone number using hangouts.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.440]   And that will be-- if they put that on mobile, who needs a cell carrier?
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   Right?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   That'll be huge.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   And I think they're moving toward that with voice and hangouts.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   Sure they are.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.440]   The price coming together.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   I mean, the problem there is you're using data.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   But by the way, T-Mobile just put out today, new higher limits on tethered data.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   They've got the unlimited still.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   T-Mobile's competing really hard on plants.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   Love them.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.040]   And LTE 7 is coming with a T-Mobile SIM and one month to gigs free.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   Good.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.040]   My car came with a T-Mobile SIM.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   Really?
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   Yes.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   Really?
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   Wow.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   It's that bizarre.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.040]   T-Mobile's my carrier.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   My carrier choice.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   I use T-Mobile and Nexus 4.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.840]   It is the best.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.440]   If you can get it.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.960]   If you have T-Mobile, because nobody else is using it, although that's going to change.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   They've really been growing.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.360]   Hey, before we go any farther, we should-- and we do this every year, it seems.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.000]   But commemorate Patriot Day, September 11th.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.760]   Both you, Jeff and Gina were in New York City at the time.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.880]   And you've told your stories before, very moving stories, particularly Jeff's, who was
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.720]   in the basement of the World Trade Center when the first plane struck.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.160]   I went back today.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.600]   I was-- it's weird because this was the first year where I really had no draw to go back.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   But I kind of the last minute went.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   And it's triply strange.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.280]   First because the memorial is now open for the first time on the anniversary, all of
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.400]   the activity around the commemoration moves to the memorial.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.800]   And if you haven't been there, the memorial is a fortress.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.520]   It is behind all kinds of security.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.400]   You have to go through an airport to get there.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.080]   And that alone is depressing and is troubling.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.040]   But I could barely hear a bagpipe off into the air.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.800]   So instead what we saw was the scrum of TV cameras there standing there saying nothing.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.320]   You saw the 911 nut jobs there.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.280]   Conspiracy, buff nut jobs.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   Just littering the earth.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.360]   And then, you know, families were going around to go through the entrance to the memorial.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   And that was it.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   So it was cut off.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.880]   Which to me is emblematic of where we are, where there should be a matter of openness
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   and freedom.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.240]   It's instead another fortress.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.600]   And this happens at the time of the NSA revelations.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.320]   Which you know, the excuse for all of them is 9/11.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.840]   And I confess my mistakes that I thought we could do more to bring democracy to the world.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.880]   And I supported the Iraq war and I was wrong.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.080]   But I was it was a depressing 9/11 for me.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.760]   It was feeling we haven't advanced closer to democracy and freedom.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.680]   In fact, or farther away.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.960]   So that's my that's my cherry beginning to the show.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.520]   No, I think it's an apt point.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.120]   It's as if the terrorists won in a way.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.280]   Well, I almost use the line and I couldn't find the right way to use it, you know, without
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.480]   the right level of irony and mockery.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.480]   But so I didn't.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.560]   But yes, I think you're right.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   That's the goal of terror.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.720]   Is it not to terrify people to have them shaking in their boots, looking over their
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.360]   shoulder paranoid and it worked?
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.080]   That's very sad.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.240]   This is my first 9/11 that I have a daughter, a child, and I was giving her a bottle this
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.320]   morning and thinking about it and thinking that I'm going to have to tell her about this.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.120]   You know, when she's when she's old enough and it's going to be a thing that I experienced
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.440]   that she didn't experience and there's there's plenty of footage and documentation, right?
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.320]   But she's going to look back at this the way that I look back at or the way that I heard
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   my parents explain about, you know, John of Kennedy getting shot or the Vietnam War.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.760]   Like it's going to feel like a far away thing that happened to people who are, you know,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   much older or dead.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.000]   Like us, like we do.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.600]   You don't remember the Vietnam War?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   That's really depressing.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.640]   Well, I mean, you know.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.440]   No, of course you don't.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   Of course you don't.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   Of course you don't.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   Yeah, it happened before.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.280]   But for Jeff and me, it was World War II.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.680]   You know, our parents lived through it and remembered it and we knew great many veterans
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.040]   of World War II, but we didn't live it.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.320]   We were born after it, right?
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   Right.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.520]   And it just it struck me as like, oh, this is this is a totally different thing.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.200]   You know, Jeff, Jeffrey McManus, who actually just recently passed away, he was at Yahoo
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   for a long time.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.280]   I don't know if you know him, but his he had written this incredible blog post, his daughter
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.720]   had been born like three weeks before 9/11.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.160]   And he said the way that he sort of experienced the whole thing was through the lens of having
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.640]   a child that was so small and that for so many years he felt he would he felt so bad.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   Like he would apologize to her.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.400]   Like I'm so sorry that I brought you into this into this terrible world, you know, that
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.440]   this was this was an embedded world for you.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.160]   And he had this incredible line when he said, you know, it took me years to realize that
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.680]   like the world is in a gift that we give our children, our children are a gift that we
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.200]   give to the world.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.040]   And that was that really I was thinking about that a lot today when I was giving it a her
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.280]   bottle and thinking about September 11th and thinking about, you know, how much things
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.200]   have changed and yet how many have many things have stayed the same.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.600]   I still can't I still can't watch the video or see the pictures without getting like completely
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   clenched.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.080]   It's crazy.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.400]   I think this is a good time for this would be a good day, Patriot day for people, of course,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.360]   to remember that but also to choose to stand upright and to remember that the principles
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:36.320]   of the United States are openness and freedom and democracy, not paranoia, not, you know,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   shutting down but opening up.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.200]   Amen.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:47.800]   And maybe that's, you know, you know, ten years after any tragedy, it becomes a tourist attraction.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.960]   And that's obviously what's happened.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.360]   It's very it's kind of sad.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.400]   When you leave the memorial, you know, you walk through the gift shop.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   Oh, God.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   And but that's but that's us.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   That's humans.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.200]   We don't we have a terrible capacity for remembering pain.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   And I think that's biological because otherwise you wouldn't have children.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   You wouldn't.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   Amen.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   You wouldn't.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   You just kill yourself.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   You go.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.600]   You don't have to be more pain for 80 years.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.000]   And then I die.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.400]   So you don't remember that.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.440]   Otherwise we wouldn't we wouldn't have a race left.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.920]   The people in the Ander thaw's probably felt that way.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.720]   That's why they didn't make it.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.240]   But I but I do think that it's important that the if we do keep the memory of 9/11
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.440]   alive, it's not as oh my God, what's going to happen next?
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.240]   Oh my God, they're out to get us.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.120]   It's a it's the memory of the people brave people who stood up that day and and to inspire
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.720]   us to continue to stand up against terrorism.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.000]   And that does not mean spying on our people.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.400]   Acting as if everybody who is Muslim is evil.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.120]   That's that's not what we that's not what this country stands for.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.480]   And I would hope that we would remember that.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   I agree.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.440]   And you know, one of the problems I'm having these days is that is is with the Syria discussion
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:05.320]   is and recognizing the mistakes of Iraq.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.520]   What are the obligations we have to other people on earth?
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.360]   Where is the red line?
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.320]   And and I wish we were having that discussion.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.160]   I mean, glad we're having a discussion before launching military action.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.840]   We're stopping and thinking and talking about it.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.240]   But but we also have to not just be isolationist.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   We also have to recognize an obligation to other people to help them with their democracy.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:31.000]   And and you know, the Arab Spring running afoul in Egypt is is I think demoralized.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   People think what's not possible.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.600]   We have to still up to remember what's possible.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   We spoke.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.800]   I still have to look for the hope and look for the optimism.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.680]   I find hope and optimism in what Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden did and what the
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.600]   Guardian is doing right now.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.680]   You know, I think it has to be a reminder to our leaders that their first obligation
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.520]   is to protect freedom.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.200]   But yeah, yeah, I like that.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.760]   But that way and that's why maybe, you know, maybe 200 years is all you can expect from
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   a republic.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   I don't think so.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:08.560]   But that's why we need to stand up as that, you know, city on the hill, the bright shining
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.760]   light of hope for people.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.120]   And and we need to stand up for those principles that made this country great.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.400]   I I'm I'm a patriot.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.680]   But that doesn't mean become a surveillance state.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.440]   That's exactly the wrong direction to go.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.600]   Well, you know, I don't believe the spies.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.040]   I wrote about this my post today.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.400]   I'm just trying to keep us safe.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   I understand.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.760]   That's cats must kill spies must spy.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.000]   You know, there's an instinct and we send them off.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.720]   It is I would even give them credit.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.440]   I would even give them credit to say that they are patriots.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.920]   They are trying to protect us.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   Yes.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   Yes.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   Yes.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.560]   A soldier has to set off and doesn't have a choice from what war they fight in and go
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.400]   to follow orders and the spies the same.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.000]   I put the the the the responsibilities solely on the politicians and then in turn on us
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.400]   for choosing them and not more than accountable.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   Exactly.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Yep.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   We're the voters.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.020]   and our government, and what really makes me say
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.600]   is when people say you see it,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.800]   just can't do anything government sucks,
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.440]   they're all politicians, I'm just gonna opt out.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.180]   That's not how you fix this.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.560]   - Opting out is the wrong way to go.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.320]   As somebody in the chat room said,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.720]   "Give me liberty or give me something."
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.540]   (Gavin laughs)
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.280]   There is a lot to talk about.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.360]   I tell you what, let's take a break.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.040]   I wanna get your, so the Moto X is out for you,
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.440]   I'm sorry to see.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.520]   I'm curious if you even are considering an iPhone.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.720]   I know all three of us probably had iPhones at one point.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.840]   I am still a Moto X lover.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.800]   I'm a lover, not a fighter.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   I'm really loving this.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.600]   And this in fact, I decided it is the phone
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.280]   I'm gonna take with me on my trip.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.580]   And I have them all as you well know.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.320]   But you know what, when an X is five comes out,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.160]   unlike you Jeff, I will buy it no matter what.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.280]   I have to own them all.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.960]   So I don't look to the future as you do.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.640]   I just use what's best right now.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.160]   So we got an HTC One, we got an X is four,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.240]   and we got a Moto X.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.640]   And we don't got no iPhones.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.800]   So let's talk about the new iPhone, if anybody's tempted.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.180]   But first a word from our friends at legalzoom.com.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.800]   They're not a law firm despite the name.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.120]   You might say, "Oh, that's a $350 an hour
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.520]   "white shoot attorney firm, right?"
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.160]   No legalzoom is, I love legalzoom.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.800]   Because the idea is that a lot of the legal work you need
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.120]   can be done, you can do it yourself with the right direction
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.680]   and that's what legalzoom does.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.480]   They give you a way to get the documents you need
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.400]   under your direction.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   It's something that fosters entrepreneurship for instance.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.440]   When I first started Twit, you know,
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.400]   I asked my friend Kevin Rose, who started many companies.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.120]   I said, "Do I need, what should I do, what paperwork?"
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.360]   He said, "Get an LLC."
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.600]   I said, "All right."
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.880]   He said, "You gotta have that, protects your liability.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.120]   "It's easy to do.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.960]   "It's not expensive."
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.720]   Legalzoom.com, $99 in fact.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.680]   You walk through questionnaire was very easy.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.600]   In fact, we're still using the operating agreement
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.120]   that I created through Legalzoom.com.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.600]   That's how good it is.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.240]   It's so nice to feel like,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.120]   that's one of the things that's so great about this country.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.920]   You can do this yourself.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.520]   And legalzoom makes it easy.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.120]   You can also get a trademark.

[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.960]   I've been thinking a little bit about,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.600]   I was in Egypt in 2009.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.280]   And it was not, of course this was before the Arab Spring,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.880]   but I was thinking, there were two lessons
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.120]   I really gained out of that visit.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.800]   First of all, I knew that they were in trouble
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.680]   because the population was growing.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.920]   I think it was a million and a half people every other month.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.680]   And because Egypt doesn't have arable land,
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.280]   it's just on the Nile, the rest of it's sand,
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.760]   they all came to Cairo.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.480]   And when a city is growing by a million people
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.000]   every other month, something's got to give, right?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But the other thing that was a great lesson to me,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.600]   and I came home really appreciating the United States,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.640]   where we live by the rule of law.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.280]   We have these discussions,
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.840]   and we get angry at the NSA,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.920]   but we live by the rule of law.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.760]   And I remember talking with people in Egypt,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.360]   and yeah, if you wanted to do something
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.840]   you had to go bribe somebody.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.280]   And it felt chaotic.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.160]   It felt like if you knew somebody
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.600]   or you had the money to bribe somebody
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.120]   you could get stuff done there.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.160]   But if you didn't, you were out of luck.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.960]   Half the houses, most of the houses in Cairo are unfinished
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.680]   because the law is that when you finish a half status
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.040]   when you start paying taxes.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.160]   So nobody finished their house.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.040]   And there was this great sense of,
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.320]   we don't care, everybody's in it for himself.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.800]   And that really when I came home,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.840]   I realized how powerful it is that in this country
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   you can sue somebody and the judge's decision stands.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.000]   And you don't go out and shoot him in most cases.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.600]   You go, okay, I guess I lost.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.560]   For all the complaints we make,
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.000]   this is a pretty remarkable country we live in.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.080]   And the rule of law is so important.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.120]   It's absolutely true.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.720]   I mean, there's lots of problems with the system,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.760]   but we're empowered.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.320]   It's a system designed for us to be able to change it.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.160]   - Exactly.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.600]   And that's why these discussions are so great.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.440]   - Yep.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.440]   - And nobody has yet compounding on my door saying
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.160]   you better shut up about the NSA.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.320]   Now if I were at Johns Hopkins University, they might,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.480]   but that's a situation. - Well, yes.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.480]   That is that shameful.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.320]   - It really is.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.880]   Now there's been an apology.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.080]   - They backed down.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.120]   They backed down, but the fact that a university
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.520]   would not support free speech is appalling.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.360]   - I missed this.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.320]   What happened?
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.400]   - So there's a very well-known crypto expert.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.120]   I'm gonna get his blog post.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.200]   He's a professor at Johns Hopkins.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.960]   And his name is Matthew Green.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.720]   And he has a blog on blogspot,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   but he also mirrors it to a site at JHU.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:18.360]   And he wrote a scathing blog post
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.880]   about this whole NSA stuff, in which he said, for instance,
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.800]   I was totally unprepared for today's bombshell revelations
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.080]   describing the NSA's effort to defeat encryption.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.360]   Not only does the worst possible hypothetical
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.880]   I discussed in previous years appear to be true,
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.960]   it's true on a scale I couldn't even imagine.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.040]   He was worried when he was talking about it in the past
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   that he'd be considered a crank.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.600]   He says, "I'm no longer the crank.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.200]   "I wasn't even close to cranky enough."
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.520]   The academic dean contacted him and said,
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.160]   "Take down all posts of that blog."
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.120]   - And the NSA logo.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.120]   - The NSA logo was on it.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.800]   - Yes, he made him take that down as well.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.200]   - Now the reason it's a big deal
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.760]   is because there is this tradition in universities
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.960]   of open expression, of freedom of speech.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.720]   - Yeah, not just universities by the way,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.240]   but yes, but it's particularly in universities.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.080]   It's important.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.640]   - Especially in those environments, yes.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.880]   - So the question was, why was the administration
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.880]   asking for this turns out that Johns Hopkins has a,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:29.440]   let me see if I can.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.840]   Find the, there's a part of Johns Hopkins
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.600]   that does business with the NSA.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   And it's unclear at this point what the chain of requests
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.280]   were the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab,
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.640]   whose motto is enhancing national security
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.000]   through science and technology.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.960]   Apparently went to the academic dean,
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.640]   somebody, we don't know who at the APL
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.160]   went to the academic dean and said,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.520]   these are classified documents you're linking to.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.440]   It wasn't by the, well, okay, well,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.560]   this is an interesting point.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.400]   - Well, right, they were classified now
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.240]   that everyone seems to have--
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.280]   - It was the Washington Post articles, public articles,
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.560]   but in fact, and we had this discussion on security now,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.280]   they are technically, they are still classified.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.360]   - Right, and so the government people are told not to read.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.200]   - Not to read them.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.040]   - He was speaking to them, but he's not a government person.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.880]   He's a professor.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.800]   - Right.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.600]   So the dean of the engineering school, his boss,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.200]   asked him to take down the post and to stop using the NSA logo.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.520]   - And he made a point of saying it wasn't the dean's fault.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.760]   - He also said, I should look,
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.520]   I should get a lawyer if I didn't take it down.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:43.040]   - Wow, they have since issued an apology?
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.600]   - Not exactly, they said he could put it back up.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.880]   They're not saying what happened.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.160]   Johns Hopkins told ours, Technica,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.400]   "We didn't receive any inquiry from the federal government
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   "about the blog or any request from the government
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.960]   "to take down the mirror site.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.880]   "As to where the information came from,
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.760]   "we are still tracing the path of this event."
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.880]   Like, I don't know, somebody told me to tell him that.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.640]   - Unbelievable.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.480]   - Wow.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.960]   - And shameful, and they did back down,
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.840]   but anyway, Matthew Green is a very smart and good guy,
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.240]   and his articles, his blog posts are very good,
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.240]   and I recommend you read them.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.840]   They're the full poster on the blogger.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.680]   Google didn't ask him to take it down.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.920]   - Yeah, and he also, by the way,
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.440]   he wrote another post today.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.320]   He said he, his wife, talked about it,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.160]   and he has this short window of fame
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.000]   where people are coming to it, so he used that
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.280]   to make the point at a very good post saying
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.560]   that we have to restore, the question is rather,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.560]   how do we restore faith in technology?
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.720]   - Yeah, 'cause that's really the big,
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.680]   to me, the big detriment of all of them.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.800]   Well, there's a number of them.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.480]   One of the big detriments of all of this
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.880]   is nobody trusts anything.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.800]   When Apple announced this fingerprint reader,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.760]   the first thought everybody had is,
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.960]   oh yeah, it probably sends it off,
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.520]   your fingerprints off to the NSA, doesn't it?
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.560]   But it doesn't, right?
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.880]   - It does, well, Apple says it doesn't.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.200]   - Apple says it doesn't, right?
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.760]   Now, consumers, I was talking about this with Kevin,
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.400]   Apple says that it's stored locally, right?
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.080]   And it's just used to unlock your life.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   - It's cached and stored locally.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.200]   It's cached and stored locally,
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.240]   and it unlocks your iTunes account.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.920]   But do we trust, first of all, do consumers
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.320]   get that difference that it's not sent to the internet?
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.560]   Do we know for sure that it's not sent to the internet?
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.080]   Do we know for sure that there isn't some sort of,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.240]   that there won't be in the future some sort of vulnerability
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.800]   on the device or in the operating system,
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.960]   or some sort of hole that a malicious app
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.560]   could take advantage of in order to transmit that information,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.200]   the way that your location information was transmitted
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.040]   from your account?
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   - Yeah, there is a slide in those NSA presentations
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.640]   that say, oh, by the way, if you wanna know
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.240]   where the perp spin for the last six months,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.160]   this thing on the Apple iPhone is stored,
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.480]   and you can just get that.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.960]   - Yeah, here's the file name and location on the device.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.040]   - So we know that they're aware of these things.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.000]   This is exactly the kind of thing the NSA specializes in.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.960]   Collectively, I believe Apple, when it says,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.240]   we're not doing this.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.720]   But that's the point of this is you can no longer trust,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.920]   you feel like I can't trust anybody.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.800]   And if you're not a US, if you're not in the US,
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.520]   - If you're in an airport, in an airport.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.120]   - Oh, that's another story.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.040]   - Well, David Miranda have been physically forced
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.600]   to put his finger on his phone.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.000]   - I am leaving the country, as you know,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.400]   and I'll be coming back October 7th.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   And we are now learning that it is the border and customs,
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.440]   maintains a list of people for law enforcement in the US
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.760]   that they wanna seize their stuff.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.640]   And because you're crossing into the United States,
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.240]   they don't need any warrant or anything.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.520]   You just need to be on a list,
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.440]   and they'll take all your electronics.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.680]   And then they analyze them for bad stuff.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.920]   So-- - Or are you taking inventory
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.160]   and everything that you said and done, Leo?
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.000]   (laughs)
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.840]   I'm thinking maybe--
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.480]   - No, there's nothing on my stuff that I'm worried about,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.000]   but I don't wanna lose my computer, my phone, all my stuff.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   - Yeah.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.760]   - And you don't know if you're on a list.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.600]   - There's no recourse when it happens.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.920]   - And there's no recourse.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.400]   It's a lawless zone, literally a lawless zone.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.480]   - Now, let's go back to the fingerprint real quickly.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:24.000]   I don't know about New York State, but in California,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.360]   we get fingerprinted when we get a license.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.200]   - Really?
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.040]   - Oh yeah.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.080]   And that database is unencrypted
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.040]   and shared, I am sure, with law enforcement.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.400]   So I'm not worried about iPhones.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.760]   They already have all my fingerprints anyway.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm in the process of adopting,
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.960]   legally adopting my daughter,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.320]   and I was, they did a full background check
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.080]   and I was fingerprinted during that process as well.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   - All the time.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.720]   - Passports, arrests, obviously.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.400]   But these are the things that I associate
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.320]   with getting fingerprinted for, right?
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.240]   Background checks, arrests, passports,
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.600]   and coverage license, you know, so--
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.480]   - How about this one?
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.240]   In Disneyland, if you get one of those passes
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.280]   that you can go over, they fingerprint you.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.120]   And that's how--
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.960]   - Oh really?
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.800]   - Yeah.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.720]   - One of the like, fast passes?
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.960]   - Yeah, then they use the fingerprint
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.800]   as your way to get through the styles.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.520]   - Right, oh, that's interesting, huh?
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.200]   - One of the greatest things I ever did was sign up
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.760]   for global entry so that if we were in the airport
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.440]   at the same time, Leo, you're standing a lot alive.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.520]   I'm zipping right past you,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.360]   and my fingerprints go on the machine and I come in.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.920]   - Yeah, and do they do biometrics of your eye?
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.720]   - Yes.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.560]   - Yeah.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   - Well, I'm not sure, actually, I'm not,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.400]   I'm not sure if that's--
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.240]   - I did an iris scan.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.080]   - I'm just gonna capture on you.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.960]   - I didn't, no, no, I did an iris scan for clear.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   Remember that?
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.600]   Clear where you could jump ahead.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.800]   When you get fingerprinted, an iris scanned.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.640]   Now I realize the whole thing.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.560]   You got no secrets.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.800]   - I'm surprised it'll take a little crank of your hair.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.280]   - I get a strand of hair and maybe you run the DNA test, yeah.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.280]   - Well, except, you know, here's the thing.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.520]   I wrote another piece for the Guardian,
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.800]   arguing that what's, people say that privacy is dead,
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.600]   but what I say is that secrecy is dying.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.200]   And that the lesson of Snowden, Manning,
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.720]   Greenwalt, Guardian, and all that is,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.280]   and Clay Shurkey says this better than I can,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.760]   as like many things,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.240]   a secret is only as safe as its least trusted holder.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.920]   And what the government has to learn
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.000]   is that it can't hold secrets like this from us.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.400]   And that's the hope I find in this story.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.040]   So when the encryption story came out,
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.960]   I said, "Hallelujah, we know about this."
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.360]   And there's no stopping us.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.720]   - Yeah, at least we are having the conversation.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.480]   - It does make you wonder, though, how much we don't know.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.320]   - Oh.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   - Well, and so that is the real chilling effect of this is,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.920]   do people even trust technology anymore
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.320]   and do people outside the US trust US technology anymore?
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.760]   - We are going to see annual reports coming up
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.960]   from the likes of Cisco and Google and who knows,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.360]   who else blaming the NSA for some portion of lost revenue
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   to international clients.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.080]   - It's gotta be huge.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:28:59.920]   - Yeah.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.360]   - I mean, our own government said,
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.640]   don't buy phones from Huawei and ZTE,
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.000]   'cause the Chinese military are owners of these companies,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.600]   or part owners of these companies.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.960]   Well, if our Chinese, I sure as hell wouldn't buy an iPhone.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.240]   - What goes around?
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.800]   - So here's the story from the New York Times,
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.400]   newly released documents reveal the government uses
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.480]   border crossings to seize and examine travelers,
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.360]   electronic devices, instead of obtaining those difficult
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.960]   to obtain search warrants.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.400]   There's such a pain, aren't they, search warrants?
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.520]   This is completely legal, the government can subvert
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.160]   our constitutional protections against unreasonable search
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   and seizure merely because we're crossing the border.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.000]   Americans crossing the border being searched,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.520]   their digital media is being seized in the hopes,
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.160]   in the hopes that the government will find something
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.480]   to have them convicted.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.640]   - And of course, any one of any sense,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.520]   terrorist or criminal is not gonna be bringing
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.720]   against across the border.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.920]   They already know better anyway.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.000]   - These are phishing expeditions.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.520]   - Yes, they're Harrisburg.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.320]   - It's, yeah. - In case of
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.200]   - They were branded, it was intimidation theater.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   - It's intimidation.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.480]   So, TEX, T-E-C-S, is this computer system used
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.280]   to screen travelers at the border,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.120]   includes records from law enforcement,
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.040]   immigration and anti-terrorism databases.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.480]   A report from the DHS about border searches
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.280]   of electronic devices says a traveler may be searched
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.160]   because he is a subject of or person of interest
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.880]   in an ongoing law enforcement investigation
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.080]   and flagged by law enforcement lookout
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.600]   in the Immigration Customs Enforcement Computer System, TEX.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.560]   And if you are, they're just gonna take your stuff,
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.440]   be expect to be harassed, questioned,
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.720]   and they'll take your stuff.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.360]   - See what happened to though,
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.840]   is that when David Miranda came across,
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.480]   he had to give up his, they made him,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.400]   they said, "You're going to jail
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.600]   "if you don't give us your passwords."
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.520]   So even if you have a Chromebook,
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.120]   a lovely pixel like mine,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.920]   that virtual metadata is in the cloud, it's not local.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.200]   And you've got to sign on the machine.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.240]   In the UK, they threatened him with jail
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.200]   saying, "Hand over your passwords, bud."
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.040]   - Right.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.000]   You might say this doesn't ever happen,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.480]   according to records from the Customs and Border Protection,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.120]   it happens 15 times a day.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.240]   - Geez.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.880]   - Wow. - Over the last year.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.720]   About 930,000 people are screened daily
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.800]   by border agents, 4,957 of them,
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.360]   were subjected to what they call electronic media searches.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.800]   They go through your laptop, your phone,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.200]   they look at stuff, and this came up
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.160]   because a fundraiser for a young guy
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.680]   who was raising money to defend private manning,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:54.440]   David House, he was on a list 'cause he was doing that.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.720]   And so they took all his stuff.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.880]   He says, "I can't make a living."
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.720]   - I feel like 26. - 26,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.440]   they took my computer for seven months.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.680]   I can't make a living.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.040]   After seizing his device, his immigration authorities
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.560]   sent a copy of Mr. House's data
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.600]   to the Army Criminal Investigation Command.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.080]   He was not accused of any crime.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.480]   I wanna point this out.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.360]   He was a person of interest because he was raising money
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.240]   to, for Bradley Manning's defense.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.000]   - For someone to put up a constitutionally protected
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.080]   defense in a court of law.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.760]   He came back into the country from Mexico.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.880]   They seized his laptop, camera, thumb drive, and cell phone,
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.580]   and kept it for seven months.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.600]   No evidence of any crime was found.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.680]   And that nice.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.360]   - Does it make you look forward to your vacation?
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   - I don't know what to bring.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.000]   I don't think I'm on any lists.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.040]   But if you could get on a list
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.000]   because you tried to raise money for a legal defense fund,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.640]   then I suppose I could get on a list.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.680]   - Yeah, I was just saying,
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.760]   you promoted the EFF.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.560]   I mean, there's plenty of things that you said here
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.840]   on the air, that you could be considered.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.000]   You're gonna be fine.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.840]   It's just that.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.280]   - Well, yeah, it'd be great.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.120]   It's a great story.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.000]   If they keep my computer and phone,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.760]   I guess I will be getting that next slide.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.080]   - The right thing with the legal board is,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.920]   that's okay.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.760]   I got 200 more.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.600]   - Yeah, I got plenty more at home.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.160]   Take everything you want.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.200]   - Take what you want.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   (laughs)
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.880]   - Well, and of course, I don't take anything out of the house
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.920]   that isn't in strong encrypted.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.520]   So I've got strong encryption on my phone.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.720]   I got stronger encryption on the laptop.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560]   The next question is,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.720]   well, are they gonna then demand the keys?
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.560]   - That's the thing.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.040]   - You'll be only more suspicious
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.800]   because you have the encryption.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.200]   - All right, the PGP problem.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.040]   - Yep.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:38.880]   - Well, that's another thing.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.480]   I have regular encrypted email conversations
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.200]   with people all over the world.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.040]   Daily.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.680]   (laughs)
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.480]   - Of course, he's talking about where to find good people.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.480]   - It's the most trivial crap you ever,
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.160]   most of it is, does my PGP key work?
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.400]   Yes, it does.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.320]   - Yes, it does.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.160]   Good job.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.000]   (laughs)
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.880]   - Occasionally we'll make a snide comment about the NSA.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.000]   Not yet illegal.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.320]   I hope.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.040]   (laughs)
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.400]   So I hope you watched this earlier today,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.000]   our security now, if you didn't download it.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.720]   Steve debunks this notion that all encryption
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.960]   is broken by the NSA.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.560]   There is no safe encryption, blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   - That story came out.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.000]   Steve was already out.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Steve's not on Twitter that much,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.440]   but he was out on Twitter very quickly saying,
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.640]   "It's okay," and we go read this,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.320]   and it was good to see it was just reassuring.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.840]   - Call me, yes.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.240]   - Unfortunately, when it comes to technical subjects,
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   mainstream media doesn't do a very good job,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.560]   either of understanding it or explaining it.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.600]   And unfortunately, there's this tendency
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.240]   towards sensationalistic headlines,
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.760]   like from the New York Times,
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   NSA able to foil basic safeguards of privacy on the web.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   The agents-- - Or they can do it.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.920]   It's not through technology.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.480]   It's through other kinds of--
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.040]   - Well, this is what the article said,
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.560]   which is completely wrong.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.400]   The agency has circumvented or cracked
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.360]   much of the encryption or digital scrambling
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.600]   that guards global commerce and banking systems
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.080]   presex to sensitive data like trade secrets
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.160]   and medical records and automatically secures
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.800]   the emails, web searches, internet chats,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.960]   and phone calls of Americans
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.760]   and others around the world the documents show.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.000]   They did not show that.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.840]   - Now, so they were saying,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.320]   the Times was saying they've cracked HTTPS, right?
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.280]   - So they have not. - That was an understanding.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.280]   - Right.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.880]   - That's what the Times was saying.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.480]   But that is not true. - How do we know they have not?
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.840]   - Because it's strong encryption.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.400]   As Bruce Nier says, trust the math.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.360]   - Bruce has seen all the documents.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.840]   - Yes, he's seen the documents.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.640]   - In fact, I made that connection
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.800]   introduced them to the Guardian.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.160]   - Oh, good. - And work with Greenwall.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.000]   - Thank you. - Thank you.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.640]   - And-- - Thank you, yeah.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.400]   - 'Cause Bruce knows his stuff.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.200]   - So-- - And so I, when he looks at the stuff
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.320]   and says, don't worry folks, here's the status of it,
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.480]   I have, when he and Steve both do,
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.640]   that gives me a lot of faith.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.760]   - So what seems to be true is that the NSA
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.560]   has a fairly large budget, about $250 million a year.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.640]   And by the way, all law enforcement has always been
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.360]   very nervous about the idea that a lot of the net
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.120]   is dark, that they can't see into encrypted stuff.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   - They're only making, it's a Streisand effective agreement.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.960]   - I know.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   - They're only gonna make more things--
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.440]   - They're pushing us under ground here.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.320]   So they have about a quarter of a billion dollars
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.160]   dedicated to somehow circumventing this.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.720]   But most of it is probably planning moles
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.640]   in big companies, finding existing holes.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.400]   In fact, the only thing that they cracked,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.880]   they did two things, they were able to crack broken stuff.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.040]   They know that stuff's broken,
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.640]   when we talk about it on security now all the time,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.960]   so if you listen to security now, you know too,
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.680]   and don't use it, things like web.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.800]   And then they also, apparently about seven years ago,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.280]   persuaded NIST, the National Institutes
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:03.080]   of Standard and Technology to release a completely broken,
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:08.120]   1,000 times slower random number generator
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.480]   that they had a backdoor into.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.360]   Nobody uses it because it's so bad.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:17.080]   But they're trying, and I think that is certainly
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.680]   the takeaway, they're trying.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.200]   - And Leo, what about not open encryption,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.120]   but proprietary--
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.480]   - Well, that's the issue.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.760]   That's the issue, right?
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.400]   - So you can look at true crypt, and I can't, you can't,
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.280]   but somebody who knows, Gina probably could.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.240]   Somebody understands code, could look at true crypt
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.200]   and say, no, no, this is clean code.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.960]   If you compile it from the original source code,
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.040]   you are guaranteed there's no backdoor.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.440]   You can't do the same with Apple's file vault,
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.120]   Microsoft's BitLocker, any binary blob
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.640]   that you get from a company.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.760]   So if you presume that Apple's been subverted
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.080]   or Microsoft or Google's been subverted,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.680]   then you can, there's no way of vetting it.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.760]   There's no way of saying, well, I don't know, is it?
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.000]   - And subversion is the right verb here.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.840]   My big fear in this story, I have no basis for this yet,
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.320]   but my big fear, and Bruce talked about it when he was on,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.040]   is that there may be something going on
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.480]   or one of these companies that the companies
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.320]   don't know about.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.200]   - Right.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.040]   - Right.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.840]   - This is this whole, unfortunately,
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:29.640]   this kind of paranoid cloud now that's over all our technology.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.520]   - And the argument from people I know at Google,
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.880]   for instance, and elsewhere is, well, no,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.280]   there's enough of us who know what's going on.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.800]   We would know it, we don't know anything.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.600]   If we did know it by God, you'd hear it.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.920]   And on that level, I absolutely trust that statement.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.200]   But I don't know enough to know what could be done
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.920]   by one person with security clearance,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   who can't tell their boss what they're doing
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.160]   at a lower level in these companies.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.760]   There are lots of people with security.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.200]   - So I have always said, and actually,
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.240]   I finally converted Steve on this one,
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.420]   use open source encryption.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.680]   And you're okay, if you're really worried,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.120]   use an open source compiler,
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.160]   compile everything from source, and you're fine.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.760]   - You're not about brute force, the Leo,
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.440]   is computing get to the point where,
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.720]   for the lower numbers of PGP,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.600]   brute force could do something?
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.400]   - For the lower, yes, for the lower bit keys,
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.920]   like a 1,024 bit key.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.100]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.600]   Even probably 2048 is probably--
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.640]   - So that's a race.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.680]   That's a question of how powerful the computers are
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.520]   that we don't know about.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.160]   - Yeah, if they really wanted to get it,
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.320]   they possibly, and by the way,
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.960]   the weak link is not the key length.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.440]   The weak link is your password.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.840]   So if you have a crappy password,
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.280]   I mean, that's the front door.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.160]   And most passwords are crappier than we know.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.680]   I mean, this is hackers do us a great disservice
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.440]   by publishing this information
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.720]   on how easy it is to crack passwords.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.600]   So you have a very good password,
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.080]   and then use long bit keys.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.360]   I use a 4096 key bit key on my--
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.120]   and that's gonna be good for--
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.200]   - Nobody's cracking your piece of recommendations
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.680]   in that case. - Exactly.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.160]   (laughing)
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   - Well, there's a Google, there's a story in the rundown
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.120]   under the Google section that a Google executive today
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.120]   said passwords are dead.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.960]   - Yeah, I was gonna say,
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.040]   not only use a good password,
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.920]   but use anything you can in addition to
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   or on top of passwords, right?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.560]   - Absolutely. - Like to step off.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.640]   - To step off, yeah.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.280]   - Yeah, in fact, we're even getting smarter
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.400]   about to step off,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.600]   because things like Google Authenticator
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.000]   are subject to man in the middle attacks,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.400]   there are attacks on that.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.880]   Now that we know that our government
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.240]   is working really hard to attack this stuff,
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.080]   not just hackers,
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.640]   but the NSA is working really hard to attack this stuff.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.200]   It's prudent to use stronger stuff.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.320]   For instance, I just got from YubaKey.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.920]   This is a good use for NFC, by the way.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.080]   I got a YubaKey, has an NFC chip in it.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.880]   That, so I have YubaKey,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.440]   makes a Google, uses the same old standard
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.400]   that Google Authenticator uses,
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.720]   but unlike Google Authenticator,
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.200]   when I launched Google Authenticator,
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.960]   it just shows the keys, right?
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.760]   So I've started to use the YubaKey Authenticator,
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.280]   which doesn't show the keys
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.120]   until you tap it against your YubaKey
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.920]   and the NFC unlocks it.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.160]   So it's not three factor,
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.760]   it's just double two factor.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.840]   Double two factor.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.040]   Just making as hard as possible.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.240]   If the government gets your phone in the airport,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:38.280]   doesn't that take away with all the things they can do?
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.680]   Unless they get me,
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.320]   well, I'm doing something somewhat less secure,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.280]   I have to admit.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.960]   So one of the things that I like about the Moto X
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.800]   is this ability to stay unlocked
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.880]   when you're within range of a trusted Bluetooth source,
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.120]   and they also have these skips,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.760]   these Motorola skip keys.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.680]   So I have, for instance, an NFC chip right here on the table,
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.080]   and when I put the phone on it, it just stays unlocked.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.720]   Now that's kind of a weakness.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.640]   But what it does let me do is use a stronger passcode.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.160]   Now instead of using a gesture, which is not very secure,
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.800]   I use a long passcode,
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.720]   'cause I don't have to enter it very often,
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.480]   and I encrypt my SSD on the phone.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.720]   So if the phone were locked as it is now,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.840]   and they don't have the passcode,
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.080]   they can't suck any data off of this phone
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.160]   even by bypassing.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.080]   - Once they do have the passcode,
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.480]   if you're sloppy about that then--
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.640]   - Well, then they beat me with the,
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.880]   if they beat me with the rubber hose,
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.040]   and I give them the passcode.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.560]   - And then two step is meaningless,
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.960]   'cause the second step is now broken.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.200]   - Right, okay.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.880]   - No, that's not true.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.840]   - Oh, okay, that's what I'm asking.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.840]   - That's not true.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.560]   Just 'cause they get access to this phone doesn't mean
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.680]   they then get access to my Google accounts.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.320]   'Cause I still have two step.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.840]   If they have my keychain though,
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.560]   I have my eubikies on that, so.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.120]   (laughing)
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.040]   - This is why we always say,
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.600]   if they have physical access to your stuff,
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.520]   it's very hard to protect you, right?
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.680]   - This is what I'm trying to figure out.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   Somebody put up a funny picture of a guy
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.760]   supposedly sleeping, and the daughter breaks the,
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.600]   the fingerprint thing by putting his finger on the phone,
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.720]   and she's laughing, right?
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.160]   But in the one hand you think that the physical is better,
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.520]   but on the other hand, as you said earlier,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.680]   our fingerprints are everywhere.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.080]   You couldn't get around that.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.160]   I don't know what the,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.000]   I don't know where the solution goes.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.840]   - Right.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.640]   So let me, let's, okay, let's go,
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.200]   we have fun with this, but let's talk about some shiny, okay?
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.680]   'Cause I don't want to depress everybody.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.200]   iPhones, the new iPhones are here.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.280]   (whimpering)
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:41.960]   They come in color, gold, and space gray, and white.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.040]   - Ooh, yawn.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.280]   (laughing)
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.040]   - Don't you want an iPhone, a fingerprint sensor?
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.120]   Don't you like that?
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.720]   - You know, I think it's a bad sign
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.440]   both Motorola and Apple think that adding color
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.000]   is innovation these days.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.280]   I think it's a very bad sign for innovation and phone.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.240]   - Well, what may have happened is we might have just,
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.200]   you know, innovated our way into the corner here.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.360]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.920]   - Like they do, it's the same thing happened
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.600]   with the word processors, right?
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.560]   You really couldn't improve on, you know,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.800]   word perfect five, but--
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.760]   - Microsoft just added 20 more features, right?
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.360]   - Right, you just had stuff you don't need,
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.880]   and oh, you gotta have the new one.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.280]   - We got the ribbon, that's what we got.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.080]   - Yeah, we got the ribbon.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.240]   So this is the equivalent of that,
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.840]   or fins on a Cadillac.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.160]   It's just, 'cause you can't, there's not much more you can do.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.960]   Although I would argue that a fingerprint sensor
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.200]   is innovative.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.640]   - Yeah, that's the one bit that is innovative, right?
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.520]   I wanna know if that fingerprint sensor
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.080]   is gonna work better than, say, face unlock.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.080]   - Here's why I think it does.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.800]   - You might not really gonna be able to pick up my phone
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.120]   and just tap the home button,
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.480]   and it's gonna unlock without me having to think about it.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.720]   'Cause I am lazy, and I don't wanna put it
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:44.920]   in the passcode every time.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.600]   I don't love the idea of Apple,
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.200]   like mass marketing fingerprinting devices.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.400]   But at the same time, I'm lazy,
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.720]   and I see the value in just being able to tap the phone
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.240]   and have it unlock from me versus someone else.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.320]   - It's not the first time, I mean,
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.600]   the Atrix had a fingerprint reader,
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.520]   but it was just unreliable.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.200]   - Yeah, this thing, Apple has to have made
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.800]   a very reliable-- - I think this is reliable.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.720]   - And I tend to think, based on their track record,
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.680]   although maybe this isn't true for all the things
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.400]   that they shipped, but that they got it right.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.520]   The good chance that they got it right.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.200]   - I think there is, they don't release products
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.680]   unless they feel, at least historically.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.800]   Who knows what the new Apple is,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.640]   but historically. - You know,
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.160]   which is such an affordable me and iCloud,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.840]   with a few software-- - And maps.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.160]   - You know, but hardware-wise, right?
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.080]   - And the cube and 20th century, and hang.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.680]   No, you can, anyway, they make mistakes,
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.000]   nobody's perfect, but you're right.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.800]   I think in general, there's an attention to detail,
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.920]   and here's where I think that this is, to me,
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.480]   the proof is it, and then the pudding.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.760]   It isn't just for unlocking the phone.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.360]   Apple has said we will allow you to buy stuff
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.240]   on the us, Apple stores with this.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.120]   - Yeah, because no one wants to type their password in, right?
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.720]   - That's huge, 'cause that's Apple saying,
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   "We trust this enough to let it,
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   so you can use it for money, for stuff that costs."
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   That is very big, because, and I think now we're gonna wait
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.600]   and see, and if it works, Apple's gonna wait and see,
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.720]   if it works, it works reliably, people like it,
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.640]   they'll give out an API, and this could end up being
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   the authentication tool of choice,
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.280]   'cause it'll have hundreds of millions of people who have it,
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.720]   in the next few years.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.600]   So that's, to me, this is what's innovative.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.920]   And I do think it works, or Apple would not say
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.440]   you could buy stuff on the store with it.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.280]   - Right.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.200]   - They could lose a lot of money.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.280]   - Yeah, and a lot of trust.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.680]   - And a lot of trust.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.520]   - A lot of customers.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.000]   - They put their money where their thumbs are.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.560]   I mean, I think that really is a big statement.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.640]   Had they said merely I would unlock the phone,
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.000]   I would say, yeah, I guess it doesn't work that well.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.840]   - Right, right.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.120]   I'm interested to see what their sales revenue,
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.640]   what their sales revenue is gonna look like,
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.280]   after this gets deployed, because it'll be just so much easier
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.960]   to impulse buy in app purchases and apps
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.160]   by not having to type in your password.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.240]   I know this makes me sound so lazy,
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.040]   but when that password pop up, pops up,
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.160]   if it's not something I really want,
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.680]   I'm like, yeah, I'll do it later.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.520]   - Yeah.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.160]   - But if I just have to tap it with my finger.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.160]   So yeah, I think that the finger--
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.280]   - I buy stuff all the time in play,
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.160]   and Google wants me to buy it.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.760]   - Yeah, Google has a setting that says,
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.960]   "Do you want us to make it so you don't have
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:08.800]   "to enter the password?"
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.960]   And you can say that.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.480]   Yeah, Google's much more lenient than Apple.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.960]   Is Apple, you have to enter your password
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.360]   every time you buy something.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.520]   So you're right, that's a good point.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.200]   Google just allows it to happen.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   - I buy off the web a lot on play as well.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.480]   - Well, come to think of an Amazon,
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.280]   let's me click on my browser.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.120]   - Yeah, one click.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:26.960]   - Yep.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.800]   - But that's more on me.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.280]   - I don't know that it's gonna make any big difference.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.000]   - Well, I think that's more on me.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.840]   That's like, well, if you turn this on and you buy something,
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.360]   and somebody in your kid buys something,
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.480]   that's your problem.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.640]   Apple's saying, I mean, I think by putting it in,
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.760]   by saying we're gonna trust a fingerprint reader,
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.080]   it's kinda on them saying we trusted our technology.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.040]   I think it's a little different.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.160]   - What I was trying to say is, I think it's cool,
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.040]   I think it is in advance, all that's true.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.680]   It's not a selling point.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.800]   - It's not.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.920]   The average Joe's not gonna say, oh, hey, that's great.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.960]   I could put my thumb on there.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.360]   - I mean, Iowa 7 is really the thing
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.280]   that's like very different here, right?
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.760]   - That's the, to me, that's the u-
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.280]   - You have any, that's the ugliest thing I ever saw.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.280]   - Oh my God.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.920]   - Johnny, I think we always think of him
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.240]   because of all these very subtle, gray,
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.880]   beige, aluminum designs for Apple.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.080]   But I think Johnny secretly loves color.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.960]   He's the guy I've run in the color I, Max.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.800]   - Yes.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   - He loves bright colors.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.440]   I think iOS 7 is disgusting.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.320]   (laughing)
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.080]   - It's a tremendous change.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.520]   I think people are gonna freak out.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.200]   - I haven't played with it, so I don't know.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.880]   Can you change the color palette?
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.560]   So it's not so candy, cotton candy?
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.320]   - I haven't tried that.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   I haven't tried the change.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.640]   I've been running the betas, you know,
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.600]   because I'm a developer, I have that in my iOS app.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.480]   - What do you think?
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.240]   Do you like it?
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.520]   - You know, I don't live with the iOS.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.360]   It's not my primary, if I live with Android really,
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.080]   and I use iOS only when I'm developing and testing.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   (sighing)
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.600]   I don't love it, I'll be honest.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.720]   I miss the old design.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.920]   I miss the depth.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.600]   I miss the curves, the buttons.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.640]   Buttons looked a lot more like buttons in the old one.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.960]   Everything is just flat and a certain kind of,
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.920]   you know, the typography.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.280]   The colors, the icons, I don't love the flat design.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.480]   I think I'm gonna get used to it because, you know, you do.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.080]   - I do like flat design. - Over time.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.120]   - But Google's gone that way too.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.760]   You know, they're flat in their logos.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.680]   There's no more bezels, no more 3D.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.200]   I like flat, I'm not against flat.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.560]   I just don't like the color scheme.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.440]   - The only one, the bottom is a rundown.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.360]   - It's just too freaking bright for me.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.280]   (laughing)
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.840]   - One of my number of candidates,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.440]   go ahead and take it as nine things
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.800]   that the new phones look like,
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.880]   from BuzzFeed.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.040]   (laughing)
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:37.880]   Go take a look out.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.720]   - Okay.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.960]   (laughing)
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.800]   - Oh boy.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.640]   - Cheese grater?
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.480]   No.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.920]   Okay, one.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   They look like Daleks.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.080]   They do those dots.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.240]   By the way, Apple, by the way,
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.400]   that image doesn't show it,
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.640]   but the word iPhone shows through one of those dots partially
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.400]   and it's hideous.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.840]   Steve Jobs would never, I know, I hate it when people say never.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.440]   Oh, you're right, they do look like Crocs.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.280]   Oh my God.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.120]   - They look like Crocs.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.680]   Oh my God, they do.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.520]   (gasps)
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.360]   - Wait, are those, are those?
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.200]   - The ugliest shoes ever.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.000]   Yeah, that's the cover Apple's selling, the dot cover.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:10.840]   - Gotcha.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.400]   - They look like candy buttons.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.200]   They look like a cheese grater.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.520]   They look like a children's calculator.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.200]   They look like a baby toy.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.000]   Connect 4 is what Sarah Lane said.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.080]   And that's, now that's the cover.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.240]   Without the cover, they look more like sweet tarts.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.320]   (laughing)
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.280]   And Nokia, I love Nokia's response on their Twitter.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.160]   Imitation is the best form of flattery.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.120]   No, it's not, it's not entertaining Nokia.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.440]   No Nokia has had color phones,
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.440]   but there have been color other things.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.000]   It's not like Nokia invented color.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.640]   - Yes, the H-O-N does show through one of these holes.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.200]   - Is that hideous or what?
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.040]   - Weird.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.800]   - I know, I hate it when people say Steve Jobs
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.720]   would never have let this happen,
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.640]   but Steve Jobs would never have let that happen.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.480]   Seriously.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.520]   - It looks like it says none through the hole
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.760]   because the H is kind of cut off.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.560]   Whoa, wow.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.600]   - Never would have let that happen.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.440]   With his attention to detail, how did that happen?
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.160]   - Very strange, very strange.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.000]   - I just don't get it.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.960]   Anyway, I'm gonna buy it.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.120]   - And meanwhile, the stock is--
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.920]   - Oh yeah, there's a response.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.200]   - 5.4%.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.000]   - This is made by Cheeto in our chat room.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.520]   - Cheeto says, "Dear Nokia,
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.040]   "imitation is the best form of flattery
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.440]   "showing all the color things Apple did long before Nokia did.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.040]   "Color Lumines."
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.360]   But you know what?
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.600]   - The color thing leaves me cold.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.800]   I don't think color seems more
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.280]   like a marketing gimmick than anything else.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.320]   I think the software changes are a big deal.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.960]   I think they're a big change.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.360]   - Well-- - People are gonna freak out.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.000]   - 64-bit, do you care that it's a 64-bit arm architecture?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.840]   I don't care.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.960]   - I don't think there's any benefit from that.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.800]   - I don't think-- - I have to think
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.120]   that Apple engineers are going crazy
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.360]   when Motorola talked about its X8 architecture
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.840]   with the extra chips that stay on,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.880]   watching what's going on,
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.400]   all of main chips turned off,
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.120]   'cause it's exactly what Apple's doing
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.080]   with the M7 Motion Coprocessor.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:07.920]   Great minds.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.040]   That was, I'm sure those were independently thought of,
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.240]   but interesting.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.520]   They're doing the same thing.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.360]   - Yeah.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.960]   - What did you guys say on Mac break and on Twitter
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.200]   about what they didn't announce?
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.600]   - Well, they didn't announce NFC,
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.280]   which I think is a blow to NFC,
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.120]   but NFC isn't just for commerce.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.320]   I use NFC as I mentioned for unlocking the phone.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.000]   There's lots of ways to use NFC that I like NFC.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.880]   - Why do you think Apple
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.520]   seems to be religiously against it?
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.960]   - They've decided to go their own way.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.440]   In fact, we talked a little bit about that.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.080]   Was it Anionako who believed
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:50.080]   that they were gonna go the Bluetooth low energy route?
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.600]   That's the technology that's used by the Fitbit
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.600]   and other devices, and presumably by an eye watch.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.320]   - What else didn't they do?
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.520]   Well, there were no surprises.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.960]   - None of this was so surprising.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:10.480]   I don't think, there was a lot of swirling rumors
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.000]   as there always are, but this is pretty much
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.120]   what I expected from them.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.240]   I didn't expect them to talk about anything but iPhones.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.360]   This is the iPhone event.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.320]   Complaint from some analysts is that it's just too expensive
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.800]   for China, it's not gonna give them scale.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.360]   - Yeah, I think we in a lot of others got it wrong,
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.040]   thinking that Apple might wanna go after that low end market.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.920]   In hindsight, that's not the Apple way, never has one.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.280]   - You're right, you're right.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.120]   - Right.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.040]   - So yeah, that's, I think one of the reasons
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.880]   the stock market punished them is they thought
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.400]   that they should have made a $350 phone.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.360]   But I don't think that Apple cares about that.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.200]   - Yeah.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.680]   - These are high margin items.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.920]   And what is odd to me is I don't really understand
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.200]   what, who the five C is for.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.520]   It's not that much cheaper.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.640]   It's $100 cheaper.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.560]   And you give up the fingerprint reader,
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.480]   you give up the fast processor,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.520]   give up the motion code processor.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.800]   I don't understand why they made that phone.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.280]   - Chris, you got an idea?
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.720]   - Yeah, I mean-- - People with red hair?
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.920]   - Absolutely, no, no, no.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.960]   (laughing)
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.640]   - Feet on the ground sort of--
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.200]   - Like you.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.560]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.960]   High school market, high school and college market,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.200]   this is huge.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.520]   - That's why we titled our show, "Mac Break Last Yesterday,
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.960]   Sea is for Kids."
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.640]   This is a phone aimed at young people.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.480]   - Absolutely.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.440]   And they got third world, not under developed nations,
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.600]   not poor people, young people.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.480]   - If you just look at the Apple website,
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.880]   I mean, it looks like the iPhone C
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.680]   is for someone who's much younger.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:45.000]   And then if you look at the version of the iPhone 5S,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   it's like this is the old daddy's phone.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.920]   - Yeah, you're right.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.600]   - Like just look at the difference.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:54.040]   I mean, people in high schools, and in high schools,
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.920]   I actually believe that those are sort of
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.440]   under sophisticated users.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.400]   They're not looking for the newest Android phone
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.320]   that they can hack.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.160]   - Yeah, no, I see.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.560]   - And the iPhone has that sex appeal
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.400]   that they really want.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.320]   - I could see my kids, in fact, my kids probably
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.520]   will want the C not the S.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.000]   - Yeah, they don't care about a fingerprint
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.920]   or 64-bit processor.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.840]   - This is for the colorful.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.400]   That's their tagline.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.600]   The 5C is for the colorful.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.800]   - I'm a colorful person.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.520]   I want a lime green phone.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.120]   - Yeah, it's funny, 'cause yesterday I was looking
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.200]   at these and I was thinking, "God, maybe I want to see you."
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.480]   - I mean, you're a colorful person.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.160]   - It really looks like the fun phone.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.520]   - It is a fun phone.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.640]   - It's crazy because I feel like I've been brainwashed
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.480]   'cause I know it's just a 5 underneath,
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.680]   but I don't know why, but it feels like the fun phone.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.800]   - Chad, you're right too.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.080]   And if you're gonna go with color,
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.400]   they go with it more aggressively.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.920]   So I got my motor wax.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.200]   I'm not dissing on the motor wax, but I got it and I said,
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.760]   "Oh, I got a blue phone."
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   - I know, it's not that, look at mine.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.920]   I mean, does this jump out at you as a red phone?
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.640]   Not particularly, of course I got the brick red.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.200]   You can get a brighter red.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.040]   - Yeah, but.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.280]   - They call this crimson, that's not crimson.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.200]   It's pretty.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.720]   You know, the truth is, these aren't really jazzy items.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.960]   - All right, well, I guess we've come to the end
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.360]   of our shows.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.040]   It is the last episode of All About Android and Shwe.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.840]   - Oh, do it amazing.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.920]   - You know, this morning, you know what Jeff,
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.000]   you're saying that in just, but in this morning,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.160]   I did start to think a little bit about that,
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.400]   that we have been in a great couple of years
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.600]   and maybe I didn't appreciate it
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.440]   where there was just lots of stuff happening.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.720]   It was very exciting.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   And we may be entering a period of time,
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.200]   a little bit of a plateau, as we have
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.880]   with personal computing, desktop computing,
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.160]   there's nothing going on.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.760]   - Yeah, but look at this show,
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.800]   and I'm gonna defend our gig here,
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.920]   but most weeks we say, wow, look at what we got talking about.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.920]   We can't believe this.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.960]   - Yeah, but I think that may be changing.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.160]   - Yeah, but maps, self-driving cars.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.200]   - Well, that's kind of what I thought.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.840]   I said, at least they'll always be software on the internet.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.040]   That's gonna change rapidly.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.080]   Hardware, we may be at the end of the whole world.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:02.920]   - Hardware, I agree.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.040]   Yeah, and watches are not empty.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.880]   - No, everybody's gonna be looking for wearable,
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.600]   and I don't think it's glasses or watches.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.000]   I love the idea of wearable.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.400]   In fact, we're actively considering
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.480]   watching a show about wearables.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.640]   'Cause I think that's gonna be an exciting area,
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.720]   but it may be early days.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.760]   - I always ask to have very long arms,
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.080]   put lots of watches on.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:23.920]   - Yeah.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.240]   I really wanna do a show about mobile and wearables.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.440]   I really think that's where exciting things are gonna happen.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.760]   And that's one of the things we do,
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.080]   is we need to look, you know,
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.000]   I didn't cover cell phones for a long time.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.320]   I hated it, you know, people kept asking me about,
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.400]   you know, well, is the Motorola Razors at a good phone?
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.400]   When I went to radio stations, you know, 10 years ago,
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.800]   that's all anybody wanted to talk about,
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.840]   'cause they weren't into computers in the internet.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.640]   And I don't care about phones, they're stupid.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.080]   I'm not a gadget guy.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.920]   I'm a...
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.080]   - Who wants to talk in the phone, email me?
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.000]   - Yeah.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.080]   And now it's where all the excitement is,
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.560]   but I think rapidly, maybe in the next,
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.560]   we gotta see what the next thing is, right?
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.440]   - Yeah, it means us feel like smart phones and tablets
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.000]   are just these slabs of, you know, touch green, right?
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.560]   - It's very basic now. - Of like a glass, right?
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.400]   I mean, and they're specs, right?
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.000]   And yet, once in a while, you have something like
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.720]   the fingerprint reader, which is kind of interesting,
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.840]   but, and they're all starting to converge
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.200]   upon the sort of same design, you know, you know,
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.760]   less bevel, we have colors, which I think is, you know,
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.120]   sort of meaningless.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.400]   But yeah, it's true.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.760]   The hardware section of all about Android,
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.320]   don't tell Jason, it's probably my least favorite,
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.880]   'cause I'm like, oh, yeah, it's another square.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:27.720]   It's another rectangle.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.720]   - They're glass rectangles, right?
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:33.240]   - You know, Leo, I'm not sure it's so much wearables
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.720]   or mobile as it is peripherals,
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.600]   that you'll have your computer, whatever form that lump is.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.880]   It's your lumpo computer, and then things are gonna talk to it
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.520]   and get to the world through it.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.880]   - Well, that's the debate that's going on right now,
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.200]   actually, very actively in tech circles,
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.440]   is should these be standalone, or should they be
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.120]   as they have been so far with the galaxy gear
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.760]   and the pebble adjuncts, accessories?
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.880]   - Well, I'm of the other opinion, I think they need
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.800]   to be standalone to be any good, frankly.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.760]   - Yes, but the telecos are gonna hold us back there,
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.680]   because they're gonna have bad plans.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.520]   - Oh, I agree.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.960]   - You might be able to, you might carry 10 connected devices.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.040]   - But that's the best argument.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.040]   - You have a camera for none.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.040]   - You have a camera for this, and that, and they charge you,
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.760]   20 bucks each month for every one of them.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.600]   - Right.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.000]   - It's gonna squash them.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.920]   - The Bluetooth pairing, that pairing with your phone
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.160]   degrades the user experience.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.800]   I agree with Leo, like, if I had to design the watch
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.440]   that I really wanted, it would have to be standalone,
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   it would have to be something that I can just put on
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.280]   and walk away.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.440]   The fact that I have to pair it, even with glass,
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.840]   it's like, okay, pair it, okay, they're talking,
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.280]   you need this, oh, the phone's in the other room, whatever.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.480]   It really, it degrades the user experience.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.120]   - Yeah, it's a really, really right point.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.760]   Something like Chromecast isn't wearable.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.800]   It is kind of an accessory, I mean, it's a remote device.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.000]   I mean, that is something interesting.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.840]   - That's a good example.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.400]   - I've been watching shows on that a lot,
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.560]   playing music from a lot.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.640]   - I use it constantly.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.880]   - I pray for other companies to support it, though.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.200]   I'm a little disappointed that they even said
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.440]   Pandora wouldn't, that hasn't happened.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.800]   - Yeah, that's right, that's right, it hasn't happened.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.440]   - There's a brief time where, on my Chromebook,
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.640]   it disappeared from Netflix and Play.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.400]   - Yeah, I will check Play again with you,
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.400]   but it's back on Netflix.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.960]   - Yeah, I watched Play yesterday,
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.560]   watching Orphan Black on the Play Store, it's good.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.400]   - It's good, isn't it?
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.680]   - Yeah.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.800]   - Well, Leo, I don't think you're wearable show,
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.000]   I don't think that the glass and the gear
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.560]   and the current sort of crop of wearables stuff is.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.400]   - No.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.320]   - It's show worthy just yet.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.160]   - No, I agree.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.400]   - But I bet it will be.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.360]   - I do feel like that's the future.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.520]   I do feel like that's the future,
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.080]   but you're right, it's too early.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.800]   - Well, it also was the precursor
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.920]   to the Internet of Things and You're Just a Thing.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.160]   - Yeah, that's what it is, really.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.520]   It's the Internet of Things.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.440]   So maybe it should be the Things show.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.600]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.520]   Jeff, Gina, you, Google, sounds good.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.360]   Our show today brought you by Shutterstock.com,

[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.280]   it goes up all the time,
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.400]   that last count, 28 million
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.280]   high-quality stock photos, illustrations,
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.760]   vectors, and video clips.

[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.040]   filmmakers all over the world.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.200]   Shutterstock reviews each one individually
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.960]   for content and quality,
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.080]   so you know everything there is good,
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.320]   but nevertheless, they're doing well over 10,000 new images
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.960]   every single day, so there's always something new.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.480]   The Shutterstock search engine is a work of art,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.240]   a thing of beauty, and a joy,
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.520]   forever you just enter in, not only nouns,
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.280]   but you can enter in adjectives,
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.160]   crazy monkeys, for instance,
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.880]   and get a variety of images that match that.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.320]   Then, now, what I want you to do is set up for the free account,
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.360]   which lets you then pick images, shove them into a light box,
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.600]   you can keep that for inspiration or later use,
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.320]   but you can also share it with clients and colleagues,
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.520]   and this is all free.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.680]   The full access to all the images, search engine,
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.160]   the light box, if you wanna use images on your blog
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.840]   or your videos or your presentations,
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.960]   they've got a number of different ways
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.360]   to do it, individual image packs,
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.960]   monthly subscription, that's what we have.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:19.920]   If you're a publication,
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.560]   the monthly subscription is the best deal.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.360]   25 images a day, that's what we get, it's great.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.480]   Everybody here at the office can use it, and it's fabulous.

[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.160]   you pay one price, use it as you wish,
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.400]   that's royalty free.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.520]   By the way, Shutterstock has partnered with Facebook.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.080]   You may be using Shutterstock, I don't know if it mentions it,
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.720]   but that's what you're using.

[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.400]   The offer code twig nine, we thank Shutterstock
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.160]   so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.120]   Don't forget the nine, that's for the month of September.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.160]   Shutterstock.com.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.840]   Are you into MOOCs?
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.280]   I'm into MOOCs.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.080]   I'm MOOCs.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.920]   With a Q?
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.560]   M-O-O-C.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.840]   I almost see, right?
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.920]   M-O-O-C.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.120]   It stands for massively online open courses,
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.400]   or massively open online courses.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.920]   Oh, yes, I've heard of these.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.680]   I can't say that I'm into them, but I've heard of them.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.640]   Oh, get into them MOOCs are awesome.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.120]   Coursera and Udacity Khan Academy was one of the first MOOCs.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.560]   Oh, OK, OK.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.000]   Google is building a YouTube for MOOCs with edX.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.520]   This is a really neat idea.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.760]   MOOC, M-O-O-C.org.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.680]   edX is an open source online education nonprofit
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.080]   started by Harvard at MIT.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.920]   And so M-O-O-C.org.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.800]   He sounds like a racial slur.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.320]   But--
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.840]   Hey, you're MOOC.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.880]   Hey, MOOC.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.360]   Get out of my way.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.200]   Yeah, MOOC.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.800]   Yeah, MOOC, yeah.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.160]   It does.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:40.640]   It's not--
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.480]   You do, I'll dydact you.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.400]   It's really a crappy acronym, I agree.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.600]   I agree, but that's it.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.440]   So it's too late.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.680]   You have to go with it.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.280]   I didn't realize that they were called
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.600]   that things like Khan Academy and Cody
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.840]   had to be in that kind of thing were called MOOCs.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.760]   Now Khan Academy is nonprofit as is MOOC.org,
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.240]   but Coursera and Udacity are money making entities.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.760]   So it's going to be interesting to watch.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.600]   I like the idea that Google is supporting an open fruit.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.080]   Or apple.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.440]   Of Apple's still has.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.800]   iTunes U.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.720]   iTunes U, yeah.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.480]   Somebody said to me, and I think this is true.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.840]   We were talking about being locked into Apple's ecosystem.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.680]   I said, you know, I can get along without it.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.400]   And he said, you know, the one thing I can't get along
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.680]   without iTunes U. There is nothing comparable
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.080]   to that maybe MOOC.org is a solution.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:32.040]   - The problem with MOOCs, I think MOOCs are fascinating,
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.080]   but it reminds me of the early days of media.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.640]   The early days of media, and we're still there
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.240]   to where we're at, shovelware.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.600]   Let's take what we do in the old world,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.840]   and let's just shovel it online.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.040]   - CD ROMs. - CD ROMs.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.640]   - I see the same thing with MOOCs,
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.040]   where we did 15-week lecture courses,
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.920]   we do 15-week lecture courses.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.560]   We've got to just utterly rethink how we do outcomes
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.920]   and how we then get to those outcomes.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.840]   And Khan Academy is far more disruptive to me than a MOOC,
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.600]   because Khan Academy deals with individual lessons
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.440]   and pieces of knowledge.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.360]   - I guess Khan Academy is not technically a MOOC,
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.040]   'cause you're not all in one course.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.200]   Right, okay, that makes sense.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.480]   - You make your course out of it,
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.280]   or you're in calculus in school,
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.440]   and you don't know who's gonna go to a Khan Academy.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.800]   I think that, what is the rest of media been about?
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.040]   Unbundling.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.480]   So we need to unbundle education.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.640]   You're gonna unbundle it from the university
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.680]   where you can take courses here, there, and everywhere.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.840]   And then you're gonna unbundle the course into lessons,
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.640]   and then you're gonna unbundle the lessons
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.240]   into specific things that you learn better
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.640]   from this way or that way.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.160]   - Well, they've redesigned Khan Academy, look at that.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.240]   - Oh, wow, really? - That's pretty.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.680]   It was never the best-looking site, but who cares,
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.440]   'cause it had all these free courses
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.720]   in every subject possible, they've completely...
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.720]   We gotta get Salman Khan on the show.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.720]   He is-- - Oh, he's--
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.240]   - Oh, he's not very nice. - He's no bell piece prize guy.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.640]   He deserves all the kudos in the world.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:59.080]   This is the how to calculate the area of a circle.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.120]   You know, I've always wondered that, let's watch.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.840]   All chocolate wafers in the shape of circular discs.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.920]   The diameter, the diameter of each wafer is great.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.760]   - Is this great? - Is this great?
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.840]   - 18 millimeters.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.560]   What is the area? - I admit, it's not modern.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.880]   - Oh, the candy, they say it's the shape of--
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.920]   - That's what's beautiful about it.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.640]   - Dydact, you know, it's not using the latest pedagogy.
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.320]   This is pretty much a teacher on a front of a blackboard, right?
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.760]   - Blackboard, yeah. - Well, you know,
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.120]   I was speaking with a bunch of people
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.960]   at NBC News yesterday, and I said at one point,
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.800]   the best use of graphics on television news
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.560]   that I have seen in decades was Tim Russert's whiteboard.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.080]   - Right. - Right?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.560]   - It's very simple, got something across,
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.520]   there were no trumpets, pardon me, Gina.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.280]   Right, it just described something
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.120]   in a way you could understand it.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.160]   - Florida, Florida, Florida.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.280]   Who could ever forget that?
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.120]   - That's right.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.880]   - Udacity is teaming up, Udacity is a for-profit MOOC.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.000]   I just like saying MOOC, I'm sorry.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.680]   - It is right. - I don't know.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.000]   - Just don't say it in Italy.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.320]   You would only listen to it. - I MOOC.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.080]   - I feel like I should be in Jersey.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.680]   Odacity teams up with Google and O and AT&T
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.920]   and other tech giants for a giant MOOC.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.000]   They call it Open Education Alliance,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.480]   but it's for industry.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.280]   They wanna provide students around the world
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.600]   with curriculum and skills they need
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.000]   to pursue careers in technology.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.360]   So it's all about getting a workforce trained up.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.000]   Which is not to me, that's fine, that's good.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.160]   I can't, I shouldn't say anything.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.880]   - I think that's where it's gonna go.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.160]   I was at the four square conference in New York a year ago
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.280]   and Mr. Nying, I forget his first name,
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.480]   co-founder of Coursera,
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.640]   and crap, for his name.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.520]   - Sebastian's grown.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.560]   - Former, no, he's amazing.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.840]   Former head of New York City Schools, Klein.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.680]   - Don't know.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.040]   - Anyway, I asked him, I said, what's gonna happen to the degree?
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.480]   And Klein said, when Cisco starts hiring people
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.320]   because they've taken and certified,
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.120]   they've taken these five online courses
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.440]   because they have the skills Cisco needs right now,
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.360]   there goes the degree.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.200]   - Yeah.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.760]   - Yeah, we actually have a new sponsor
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.320]   that's gonna do online certification training.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.360]   - Oh, that's a huge area.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.080]   - Isn't that great, IT, pro.tv, I think.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.000]   And they were inspired by the screensavers,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.840]   my old show, so it looks there in a garage,
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.720]   and it's really cute, it's really great.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.560]   - That's great.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.800]   - This is the un-muddling Leo, right?
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.080]   You take, and what will Google,
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.560]   I talked about how education was teaching,
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.160]   and research, and certification,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.200]   and I forget something, and socialization.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.440]   - Right, and you start to unbundle those functions too.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.840]   So certification, in the law field,
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.400]   it's not done by the schools, done by the bar.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   - Right.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:54.280]   - Right, and certification becomes separate from education.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.120]   - As it should be.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.440]   - Because there's great inflation and all these other things.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.840]   - As it should be, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.920]   - We should talk about Chrome apps.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.640]   I have it in the change log,
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.400]   but I feel like it's a big enough topic
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.800]   that maybe we should talk about separately.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.920]   Chrome does not have that.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.160]   - Okay, let's do this, let's do the change log.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.000]   - Okay.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.840]   - And then we will drill down on this.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.320]   It was my absolute next topic,
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.680]   'cause I think I've been waiting for the show
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.560]   so you can explain it to me.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.720]   - Plus there's new Chromebooks,
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.320]   so it's a Chrome time here.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.640]   You may be taking your Chromebook with you at Italy.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.480]   - Well, the time we're coming.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.640]   - You could probably do a Chrome show, Leo.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.920]   You probably could do it at this point.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.000]   - Oh, no, no.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.840]   I already said not to do a Metro Tiles show,
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.680]   so I don't think this is gonna happen.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.520]   - It's gonna be too much.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.320]   - I'll tell you what is gonna happen.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.840]   Some trumpeters are going to come out of the woodwork
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.240]   and play the change log theme.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.400]   - The Google change log.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.840]   - And ladies and gentlemen,
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.680]   here it is Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.520]   - Google Plus launches embedded posts,
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.240]   which means that you drop a little JavaScript
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.400]   onto any web page and your Google Plus post,
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.440]   along with the ability to plus one
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.600]   and the link attachment and your avatar
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.800]   and all the people plus one
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   and the entire comment thread will show up on any website.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.200]   - Go too fast here, Gina.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.880]   Don't go too fast here.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.720]   Don't go too fast.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.440]   To be a favorite Chad, go to any Google Plus post,
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.240]   click on the little arrow on the upper right to embed
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.160]   and then see what it gives you.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.600]   - It can give you a long Java string, right?
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.440]   Let's see.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.280]   - Let's see.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.680]   - When it gives you, it's not like embedding a video.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.360]   - People, mortals will not do this.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.200]   - Uh oh.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.280]   - I was all excited.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.120]   I was all excited.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.040]   - What's that?
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.960]   - I got Chad's latest post here.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   - And bedcoats.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.160]   - So yeah, click on that down arrow.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.520]   - Okay, where's the down arrow?
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.440]   - Blinded bed.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.800]   - Oh, it's the down arrow.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.880]   It's not the share button.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.880]   Okay, well, that's the first mistake.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.360]   Should be in the share button, right?
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.200]   - And then there's--
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.040]   - And bedcoats.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.160]   - Okay, I see it.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.240]   Yeah, place it.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.080]   - We can get away.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.000]   - Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.280]   You gotta place the script in the header
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.160]   and then place this in the body.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.240]   Oh, yes.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.280]   - Oh, that's an unfortunate implementation error.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.680]   - Is either correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.800]   but they don't even need to do this.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.800]   You can put script brackets anywhere on the page.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.600]   - Called YouTube.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.440]   - Yes, you can.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.160]   - That's a wonderful company I work with.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.560]   - Why do they do that?
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.480]   - I have a product called repost.us,
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.560]   which is really a really wonderful thing
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.520]   that enables articles to become embeddable.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.680]   Now in that case, the source,
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.880]   you put one line of script onto your source page.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.960]   That makes everything on your site embeddable.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.160]   Every blog post you do.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.360]   So even that can be embeddable.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.640]   This, nobody's gonna do.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.480]   Nobody.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.760]   - Well, they don't even need to do it this way.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.080]   You could just copy and paste the whole thing.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080]   - You should be able to copy
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.880]   these entire thing and drop it anywhere on the page.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.720]   - You should be able to.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.800]   - You can call JavaScript anywhere on a page.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.640]   - Doesn't it work?
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.480]   - But you can't do this.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.320]   This won't work.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   If you put this whole thing in my blog, it doesn't work.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.160]   Because you have to have that in the head.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.000]   - No, you don't though.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:01.840]   You shouldn't.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.680]   That's not the--
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.520]   - Ah, didn't it?
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.040]   - Or just before your close body tag.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.280]   Oh, Google.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.120]   Google Google.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.440]   - No, wait a minute.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.040]   No, wait, no, wait, no, wait, no, wait, no, hold on there.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.120]   Hold on there.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:17.840]   Does one cut and pick a minute?
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.680]   - I do it.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.520]   - You mook.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.880]   - Before the show, you mook.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.720]   - I don't believe my memory of how JavaScript works.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.760]   I don't think you have to have,
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.600]   the only reason you would wanna put that at the top there
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.600]   is for loading speed.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.400]   - You have to have a situation of loading speed.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.240]   - You have a bl--
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.360]   Leo, I put to my WordPress site.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.320]   I put it in there and nothing showed up on you.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.360]   - Let me see, I'm gonna make--
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.000]   - It might be doing some dominipulation,
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   Leo, that requires it.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   - Oh.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   - And a certain time.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.520]   - That's creepy.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.840]   - And if that is the case, and I believe Jeff,
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.360]   that's a really poor, that's terrible.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.480]   - I could have screwed it up.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.320]   I could have screwed it up.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.160]   - No, it doesn't work.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.120]   I'm doing it right now.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.920]   You're right, it doesn't work.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.160]   - You could drop anywhere on the page.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.560]   Google wouldn't have put those instructions there.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.400]   - Right, I mean--
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.920]   - There's obviously there's gotta be reason.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.760]   There's gotta be something going on in the JavaScript
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.280]   that requires it to be someplace separate.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.480]   - This is classic developer site.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.880]   I worked for the company once that said,
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.680]   "Oh good, we finished all our work, we have an API now."
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.320]   And I said, "No, no, no, no, no, with mortals
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.960]   "of media companies, API stands for,
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.520]   "I need a developer that's gonna take me a year."
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.360]   Right?
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.200]   - Yeah.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.120]   - This is the same problem here.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.320]   Oh, I gotta change my template.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.000]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute though.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.440]   It says place it in your head,
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.960]   or just before closed bodies.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.000]   That means you could be anywhere.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.760]   Body is the body of the page.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.600]   - But if you're dropping this into a WordPress blog post,
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.520]   for example, your post is in the middle of the page.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.360]   It's not just before the body closed tag.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.280]   - Right, right, that's exactly the problem.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.960]   That's why I should be able to use this.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.040]   - Someone like Jeff has to go in and edit his WordPress theme,
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.400]   to put it in the header or just before the--
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.800]   - And it's not someone like Jeff who does that.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.160]   It's Jake who does that.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.880]   - Right, always Jake your WordPress administrator.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.480]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.000]   - Smart, smart.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.760]   - But I don't even know where it's hosted now.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.520]   - I don't know why that is the case,
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.080]   but Google wouldn't have put those instructions
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.000]   if it wasn't the case.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   - Well, one of the instructions are,
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.440]   place this tag either in your head,
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.760]   which is the normal thing when you have script,
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.320]   you'd like to put it in the head before the body render.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.960]   Or just before closed, oh, just before.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.560]   - Just before, as you understand,
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.840]   this is the post is in the middle of a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:36.280]   - You're right, someone like, oh, you're right, somebody.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.440]   - But that's for loading, isn't it?
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.080]   - No, it's just, well, we'll read it, it won't be there.
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.840]   - Now I also got excited when I saw this news,
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.920]   'cause I thought you could start to embed things on--
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:51.760]   - Yeah, it doesn't--
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.200]   - Google, wait a minute, this worked, wait a minute.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.360]   All right, let me try it, okay.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.280]   So I'm gonna, I did follow their instructions
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.680]   and I put it right before the closed body tag,
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.360]   and then the page did open with the embedded thing,
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.560]   just like that. - Great, okay.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.880]   - But let me try moving this script tag up.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.560]   (sings in foreign language)
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.840]   Yeah, shut up.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.240]   Up to, should I put it at the top of the body, let's say.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.600]   Right. - Yeah.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.040]   - Now, that would be, if you just pasted it,
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.200]   I could put some, here's some text,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.280]   and then here's some text, we'll just put some crap in here.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.200]   - Those are working my work for--
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.120]   - Well WordPress may be stripping stuff out.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.720]   WordPress not-- - Well, don't WordPress not come,
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.560]   it's my WordPress blog.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.760]   I can put it in there. - Yeah, all right,
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.840]   so there I'm saving it, this is not following
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.440]   Google's instructions.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440]   - Why website? - Oh, there it is.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.280]   - I love this, I love it, I love it.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   - It's gonna come up, it's gonna come up.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.560]   - Why shouldn't this work just like a YouTube video?
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.640]   - 'Cause WordPress is-- - Standard for embedded.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.280]   - No, but you're not doing HTML,
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.960]   this is a pure HTML doc, the WordPress is doing something.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.480]   - But that's what I'm trying to say is people aren't doing that.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.000]   They wanna get this stuff spread around,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.400]   people have blogs and they have stuff like that.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.600]   The number of people who are still doing,
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.720]   Jake yells at me when we teach HTML at my school,
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.840]   'cause he said, "No wait, he's HTMLing."
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.120]   Why are they using tools like this?
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.160]   What are you doing?
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.800]   - Well, but I would point out that any,
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.840]   yeah, WordPress is stripping out.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.200]   - WordPress.com does it.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.480]   - No, no, no, no, no, it's stripping it out.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.040]   - We have a blog, you're loading JavaScript ahead,
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.800]   you're loading CSS, WordPress is doing some processing.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.280]   - It's gotta do a lot of that.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.600]   - There's lots of stuff around.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.520]   - Why shouldn't this operate like YouTube?
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.880]   It's a Google-- - No, it does.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.800]   - People would use it like crazy.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.800]   - It does. - It should.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.640]   - It does not. - It's right,
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.400]   that you should just be able to drop a tags
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.080]   in one part of the page.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.600]   - That's how every embed works like that.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.840]   - But no, but YouTube is not doing a JavaScript embed.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.000]   YouTube's, is it?
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.280]   - YouTube uses an iframe.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.320]   - It's using an iframe.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.120]   So this is JavaScript.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.280]   So watch, I'm breaking the rules.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.720]   I'm putting, I'm pasting both snippets together
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.360]   in the middle between text, not at the end,
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.880]   not at the beginning.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.960]   I'm gonna save this out, open it in the browser,
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.080]   and in a bit, it's gonna render and there it is, it does it.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.400]   - So maybe it's about that there's a product--
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.320]   - WordPress is stripping out the JavaScript
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.400]   as it should because it's worried about exploits.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.800]   And I agree, but there's nothing you can do with that.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.680]   Google can't help that if they're gonna use JavaScript,
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.160]   that's what's gonna happen.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.120]   I'm puzzled as to why they gave you the instructions,
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.760]   but I think, so it's not about DOM,
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.840]   it's about loading, I think it's about optimizing.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.640]   - I'm sure there's gonna be a WordPress short code
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:32.560]   or plugin in a hot minute, so that does this for you.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.320]   But I gotta say, I'm kind of with Jeff here
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.040]   and that this should be as simple.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:37.880]   This shouldn't be as do you--
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.040]   - Should they do an iframe?
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.200]   - Well, the problem with the iframe
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.560]   is that the height of a Google+ post is variable,
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.880]   so like with YouTube embeds and iframe,
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.520]   you can set the width and height, right?
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.920]   So I think you can do 100%,
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.920]   but I think that it gets funky in some browsers
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.800]   and I think when you expand the comments
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.600]   on the Google+ thread that the height,
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.040]   height it just dynamically
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.680]   and that's kind of tough to do in an iframe
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.040]   'cause then you'd force a scroll bar.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.600]   I just think it gets a little funky.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.560]   If they could've done an iframe,
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.040]   I feel like they would've done that.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.200]   Also the iframe-- - It was also--
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.920]   - It's a little funky with SEO as well.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.800]   Like it's harder, I think, to read the content of the site.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.400]   - So I think Google's doing the right thing.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.480]   I think that it's not an easy thing.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.160]   And that's probably why they didn't put it in the reshare
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.560]   but up in the drop down 'cause it's like,
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.280]   you gotta kinda know what you're doing.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.880]   - You would post this not shared publicly,
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.800]   it doesn't show the embed opportunity.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.520]   On Google+ it's very smart.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.600]   That's good. - That's smart.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.120]   That's smart, yeah.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.120]   - Yeah, iframes are actually deprecated,
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.880]   it's an absolutely horrible way to do it.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.160]   - Yeah, it's not a good solution.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.880]   - Well, give me a favor, give me a favor.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.080]   If it was humor me, go to repost.us.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:44.080]   Or go to, no, go to njnewscommons.repost.us.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.480]   Humor me.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:50.560]   - Okay, njnewscommons.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.800]   - Is that the same voice he used
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.000]   when he asked me to stop using Hangout today?
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.760]   - Repost.us.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.160]   Okay, Jeff.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.240]   - You understand that nothing that allows you
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.120]   to paste in stuff is gonna allow you
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.720]   to paste in JavaScript.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.000]   That's a security flaw.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.400]   So you can never do an embed that is using JavaScript
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.640]   in anything like this.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.280]   You never will be able to.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.360]   It's a security flaw.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.000]   They have to sanitize it.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.480]   Otherwise you're running an arbitrary script.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.800]   - Right, a CMS you mean, yeah.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.720]   - Yeah, no CMS is gonna let you do what the embed.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.560]   You have to control the HTML
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.080]   and it can't be stripped out.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.880]   So go ahead, what am I supposed to do here?
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.400]   - So just pick a post.
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.600]   - Oh, you're saying they're doing it right.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.920]   Okay, let's see, Apple recipe round up.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.200]   - Right, it's the same one I have.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.040]   - Yeah.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.560]   - Click on that, it's gonna go to a page that says,
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.360]   "Repost this article on your website."
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.080]   - Oh, look at that, this is nice.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.000]   - It's very nice.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:45.840]   - This is nice.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.880]   - This says WordPress right there.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.600]   - Let me do my proper code.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.600]   - Okay, the embed code's been copied.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:55.160]   They're doing a div and they're doing a script source.
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.000]   This is a script.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.400]   Let's put it in my new webpage
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.760]   that has all sorts of crap in it.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.600]   All right, so.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.640]   - I'm gonna make you lock in the Leoville
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.960]   and start posting on Leoville.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.160]   - Yeah, no, I'm just posting it.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.200]   I'm doing this locally.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.760]   So there is a script, repost article, JavaScript.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:14.160]   But by the way, this is when I took it from the arbitrary.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.600]   I bet you with WordPress, it's doing something else.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.440]   Yeah, see, it's using embed codes for WordPress.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.440]   I mean, it's using, WordPress is native.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.440]   - It's being coded without.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:31.000]   - It's not using JavaScript on WordPress, that's why.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.520]   So it's not gonna be as pretty on,
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.120]   this is the WordPress code does that?
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:34.960]   - It's very pretty on WordPress.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.800]   You know what?
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:36.640]   It's so pretty on WordPress.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.280]   What it does is it reads the CSS
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.720]   of the destination site and mimics that.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.560]   - That's right.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.040]   - No, it's obviously what it's doing.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.000]   But it's not doing any JavaScript.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.880]   It means you couldn't do things like comments
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.160]   and stuff like that.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.120]   So I'm using, if I use the one that's for my site,
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.840]   it is using JavaScript.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.760]   And so now I have Chads Post.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:58.960]   And underneath I have, this is, you know.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.480]   - Oh yeah, so it's a right.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.560]   - Well, you have no CSS, so that's not what to do.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.360]   - Yeah, this is blank, land.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.880]   - Right, it's unstyled.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.720]   - It's unstyled.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.320]   But if you look at the embed code,
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.160]   - You put it on the CSS.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.160]   - If you look at the embed code
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.360]   that it gives people who are using WordPress,
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.680]   Gina, there's no JavaScript.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.680]   This is just divs, CSS plus an article link.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.560]   - I see what you're saying.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.880]   - So of course, you couldn't do the JavaScript thing
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.080]   in WordPress, it's gonna strip it out.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.400]   - Yeah, I mean, that's why WordPress has short codes,
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.240]   right? - Right.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240]   - That's using their code.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.080]   - You plug in those short codes.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.800]   - I would have thought Google would have thought this
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.000]   through to that extent.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.800]   - Well, then we'd have to do this ugly thing,
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.680]   which is not ideal, which is--
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.600]   - Where would you like to publish it?
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.720]   - I saw it ranting.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.120]   - Yeah.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.320]   - Yeah, right, you have to have these choices.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.680]   Well, interestingly speaking of Google+,
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.680]   and WordPress, WordPress.com, and what else?
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.840]   Oh, Typepad, have Google+ sign-in integration.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.760]   And when you connect your, say, your WordPress.com account
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.720]   to Google+, then you will show up as the author
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.240]   of your blog post, Google search results.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.080]   - Nice to meet you.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.760]   - Which is a nice new integration.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.640]   Actually, I'd love to see this in our sponsor Squarespace.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.560]   I'd love to see this in Squarespace.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.000]   I'd love to see this in Tumblr.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.240]   And it seems like, you know, it's an easy way
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:21.280]   to get your name and face next to your posts in search results.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.360]   - Is that using the author tag?
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.000]   - Yes, that's using author tag, exactly.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.400]   Right now, it requires you to, you know, change your theme
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.040]   or use, I'm sure there's a plugin out there.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.480]   But now with the sign-in of Google+,
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.640]   or you don't actually sign into WordPress with Google+,
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.560]   you connect your account to Google+,
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.200]   and then Google will do that for you,
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.480]   which is a nice integration.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.360]   So they're trying to do the right thing
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.600]   for WordPress users, but yeah, I agree to that,
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.160]   and that could be a little easier.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.000]   - Continuing on with the change log.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.160]   - Continuing on the change log, thank you.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.160]   Google+--
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.480]   - You railed it.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.680]   - No, no, it's okay, I like getting into it.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.520]   Google+ just got an update this week.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.280]   XE9 brings this new screenshot vignettes feature,
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.920]   which actually super imposes whatever you see in glass
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.720]   onto the picture that you took.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.080]   So it's a nice way to kind of demonstrate, you know,
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.720]   what you're seeing as you're looking through glass.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.120]   YouTube videos and search results,
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.840]   sound search, if you long press,
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.880]   and you're listening to a song,
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.320]   Google will do a search for that song.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.440]   And the new update also lets you control the Google+ UI
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.160]   with the My Glass Android app.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.880]   So that My Glass Android app,
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   you used to be able to see someone had glass on
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.600]   and was using it, you could see what was happening
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.080]   actually on your phone.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.200]   Well, now you can remote control glass that way.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.360]   So you can hand the phone to someone else,
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.320]   or you can be maybe doing a presentation and say,
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.640]   okay, if I swipe this way,
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.840]   this is what you're gonna see on glass
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:43.920]   and it remote controls.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.840]   - Oh, so not go crazy to finger motions
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.600]   'cause I just go nutty with it.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.680]   - Do I have two fingers on this?
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.160]   Let me just do this.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.560]   So it's a little easier to do on the phone.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.000]   Also, I thought something that would make you happy, Jeff.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:56.840]   Google+--
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:57.680]   - I've already done it.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.520]   - Very important.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.360]   - Have you done it?
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.320]   So now, is it great that you have to,
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.640]   so you can sign into your Google+ account on glass.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.120]   Is it right that you have to factory reset glass
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.640]   and then sign in with your Google+ apps account?
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.480]   'Cause it doesn't do multiple sign in, right?
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.320]   You have to do one account.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.160]   - No, it does not do multiple.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.000]   Oh, God, help me with that.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.800]   Would do that because I was like, Chrome crazy.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.640]   (laughing)
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   No, there was a whole nother ramp.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.720]   (laughing)
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.840]   But I didn't have the latest version on there.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.880]   So there wasn't a factory reset opportunity.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.000]   I had to put the latest version on,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.840]   then go to settings, find factory reset, hit it, boom.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.880]   And then all I could do was sign it back in,
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.080]   go to rule.com/myglass and put in my apps account.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.200]   - Well, there it was.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.080]   - And it worked, yeah.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.320]   I mean, it doesn't quite work.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.640]   I say, I'm one of my things,
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.280]   some of my things are in my Gmail account,
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   some of my things are in my apps account.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.880]   - That's the same problem.
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.560]   - All right, so I want my apps priority inbox,
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.200]   but I want my plus Gmail account,
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.560]   so it's not multiple sign in.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.000]   But if you've got all your eggs in an apps basket,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.440]   this helps you out.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.240]   - But pardon me, for a rant,
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.640]   the issue I've had recently with,
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.040]   I've gone over, don't worry folks,
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.440]   I won't go over it like fear,
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.440]   but I've gone over this problem with multiple sign ins
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.160]   and the latest wrinkle for me was,
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.880]   I couldn't get Google Cloudprint to work,
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.280]   which I have to have work 'cause I have a Chromebook.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.520]   And because it kept on thinking
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.800]   that I was in my other account,
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.800]   I had to go through 25 steps,
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.520]   I restart the machine, it still would come back on.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.120]   I had to sign out of Cloudprint to sign back
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.480]   into another account, having no idea
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:24.320]   why it was signed into the wrong account.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.560]   The machine, everything was signed into the right account.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.520]   Get it, figure it out, Google.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.400]   - Yeah, every time I run into multiple sign in problems,
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.480]   on a pretty regular basis,
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.880]   and I think of you every time, Jeff,
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.600]   because I think there was a time when I said,
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.720]   do you, oh, it's no problem,
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.320]   just switch from the drop down,
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.280]   it's actually a problem pretty regularly.
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.320]   - The other one that gets me is,
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:49.520]   if you have a Google+ link in something,
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.560]   and I click on it, it goes to my machine account
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.200]   versus my plus account, and I can't open it
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.680]   in my plus account.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.160]   I just can't comment on it, I can't do anything else.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.560]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.120]   - Are you listening, Google?
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.240]   Are you listening?
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.400]   (laughing)
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.480]   - All right, so a few more updates,
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.760]   and I'm gonna talk about Chrome Apps.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.680]   A couple of Android app updates,
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.560]   Google started rolling out Play Music 5.2,
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.320]   which has two cool new features,
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.520]   genre radio for all access subscribers.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.600]   So if you subscribe to All Access,
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.440]   you can go into, let's see,
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.400]   you can go into radio or explore,
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.800]   you pick your favorite genre,
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.120]   and you get unlimited music based on what you choose.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.400]   And the new app for Android also has a new download queue.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.520]   So when you're pinning music or downloading music
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.800]   for offline access, you can pause and resume
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.640]   and prioritize and manage your download queue easily there.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.640]   Another Android app update, Google Earth,
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:53.520]   has been updated to version 7.1.2,
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:58.520]   and it now shows your geo-encoded Google+ photos onto a map.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.680]   So your geo-tagging your Google+ photos
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.400]   and say you've got instant upload on,
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.960]   you're automatically sending pictures from your phone
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.080]   to Google+, go into Google Earth on Android.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.680]   There's a new option under More Maps,
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.480]   which is Google+ photos,
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:16.440]   and Earth will overlay the photos that you took
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.920]   onto a Google Earth map,
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.120]   which is kind of a really, really cool view.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.040]   If you spend a day out and about town taking photos,
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.080]   you can see where you went,
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:25.920]   and you can see those photos kind of overlaid on the map,
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.800]   which is really cool.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.720]   And finally, this is the topic I wanna talk about more
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:30.720]   with you guys.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.560]   Google has announced Google Chrome desktop apps.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.400]   This means that on Windows and eventually Mac
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.440]   and other platforms, you have packaged Chrome apps
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.440]   that run just like native apps outside of Chrome,
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.960]   but Chrome kind of acts as the runtime.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.480]   These are the apps that are available in the Chrome Web Store,
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.320]   and they will have native access to native bits
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.360]   of your machine in order to act just like a native app,
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.240]   but Chrome is kind of the runtime,
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:04.200]   and these are kind of rolling out over time,
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.200]   and I wanna talk about this more with you guys.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.840]   I'm kind of excited about,
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.560]   this is really Chrome sort of becoming more of a platform,
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.800]   kind of like Android is,
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.520]   not just on the Chromebook, right,
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:15.200]   but on every operating system,
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.280]   this will spread to all platforms.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.560]   So that's all I got.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.360]   That's all I got for the change log.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.360]   - Play the drums.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.880]   Thank you, Google change log.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.200]   So Jeff, I just tried it in my WordPress,
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.600]   and it worked fine.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.960]   - Oh!
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.880]   - Just posting the whole thing in there.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:32.880]   - Yeah.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.720]   - Oh!
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.720]   - Just paste it right in there.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.280]   Now make sure you're not,
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.240]   make sure you're pasting as HTML,
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.360]   that you're in the, you know,
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.520]   - Of course I do, I would do not.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.080]   - You wouldn't, of course, of course.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:44.920]   - Of course.
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:45.760]   - So let me do you even,
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.120]   let me just, so I just paste,
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.720]   this is the code straight out of the embed.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:54.720]   Let me do a quick preview here on my WordPress.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.440]   - Oh, this ad new.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.360]   - Actually, let me just publish it.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.600]   - Testing for--
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.680]   - Okay, now let's--
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:01.520]   - Switch it.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.360]   - Let's switch.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.200]   - Is it the post?
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.000]   - Just testing, hey.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.240]   - There it is, right in there.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.080]   - There it is.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:09.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:10.760]   - I post it.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.080]   Okay, now I'm gonna publish.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.000]   If you go to buzzmachine.com right now,
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.760]   you'll see the fruits of what happened.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.600]   (laughing)
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.600]   - I love that we're live blogging.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.560]   - Let me see, buzzmachine.com.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.080]   Clever way to get traffic.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:25.920]   - What does it say?
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.800]   - It's a proper test, it worked.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.800]   Just testing pain I never mind in there it is.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:30.640]   - Jeff, you were just--
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.960]   - It's not working for me.
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.400]   - Well, it works for us.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.320]   (laughing)
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.160]   - Yeah, I see it.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.000]   - Hold on.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:37.840]   - Let me know.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:40.360]   - Now I'm really confused.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.200]   It does take a minute to--
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.040]   - No way.
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:42.880]   - You know why?
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.720]   - It's like a better measure.
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.680]   - Oh, there it is, it took forever.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.760]   All right, I take it back.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.920]   Never mind.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.160]   (laughing)
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.320]   - Well, then Google should really take those instructions out.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.160]   The whole--
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.000]   - There's no need for this.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:54.840]   - There's no need for this.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.680]   - Yeah, okay, I'll just leave it--
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.520]   - It's a little confusing, isn't it?
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.560]   - I was too high-steed.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:03.120]   I waited before and I didn't get it.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.360]   - It takes a while to load, yeah.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.080]   And I think that that's what the Jimmy Jam is probably about,
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.000]   that if it's in your header,
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.560]   that's script will pre-load.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.400]   - It'll be faster.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.240]   - It'll be faster.
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.080]   - Yeah.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.320]   - All right, Google, I'm sorry,
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.000]   but I still want you to fix the multiple sign-in problem, guys.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.840]   (laughing)
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:19.680]   I take it back, but--
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.560]   (laughing)
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.400]   - Glad we fell--
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.200]   - All is not forgiven, I'm sorry.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.920]   - Let's talk about this whole thing, this applet thing.
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:31.320]   - Applets, wow, that's a throwback.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.280]   - But that, is that what they're not calling it applets?
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.760]   'Cause that's what they are.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:37.480]   - No, they're calling their Chrome apps for your desktop.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.080]   - Yeah, but you have to have Chrome installed, right?
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.720]   - You have to have Chrome installed.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.000]   You obtain these from the Chrome Web Store.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.520]   They only run, they have some Chrome-specific code, right?
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.240]   So you've got to have Chrome installed, right?
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.120]   This doesn't work with any other browser.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.880]   And they don't run inside the browser.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.560]   They run, they're shortcuts on your desktop.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.800]   We were talking about this last night
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.920]   on all about Android.
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.640]   They're almost like, remember, Air apps?
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.000]   - Yes, and they'll be here.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.840]   - It's like the runtime, right?
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.120]   - Well, that's why I call them applets.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:08.120]   Applets was originally for Java.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.480]   - For Java, but with Java app--
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:10.800]   - Right, you have to have a runtime.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.520]   - They ran in page though.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.160]   Or I guess you could have desktop, Java.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.600]   - You could have applets, sure.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.760]   So these Chrome apps for your desktop
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:24.000]   have native access to device hardware,
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.560]   like the webcam, the microphone,
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.800]   they work offline, there's more notifications.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.920]   - Oh, Google, oh.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.120]   - Oh, this is such a security issue.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:32.960]   Oh.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.880]   - Oh, is it?
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.120]   - Oh, is it?
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.320]   - Yeah, if they're not sandboxed, oh, yeah.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.120]   - If they're not sandboxed in that they can,
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.120]   you mean that the access is--
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.080]   - They have hardware access and they're not sandboxed.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.440]   I mean, I guess that it's no different than Chrome itself,
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.840]   but at least Google controls the code on Chrome.
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:53.760]   - Chrome OS has, obviously.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.200]   - What can you, can you can only use HTML5 commands?
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.920]   Can you use--
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.320]   - I believe that these apps are built with web technologies.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.840]   I think that just like other Chrome apps,
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.960]   but they must have extended, I mean,
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:06.840]   there has to be--
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.560]   - I could just see the headlines in about two years.
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:12.920]   - Technology is that let you access sort of native--
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.760]   - It's really interesting.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.360]   - It's played out really well.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.560]   - Well, you never want arbitrary code
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.760]   from the web running on your machine, ever.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:23.160]   When you're running an application from Google,
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.240]   you're trusting Google.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.280]   Extensions are potentially problems in general,
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.040]   but when the extensions run outside of the browser,
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.680]   I mean, at least they sandbox the team.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.000]   - Do you think we need one, here's my question.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.560]   Do you have to have Chrome running
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.880]   to have the applet run?
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.520]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.480]   - No, but I'm pretty sure.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.280]   I haven't tried this, I don't have a Windows machine,
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.320]   but I would imagine there's a Chrome process running,
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.840]   but you don't have the actual--
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:51.080]   - Isn't it like just a mini Chrome window?
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.960]   - The premise of Java when it came out was
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.560]   that it would be running a Java virtual machine.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.280]   Every applet would be sandboxed,
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.800]   have very limited access to the hardware resources
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.960]   through an API, it would be secure.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.760]   And of course, we've learned that without constant,
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.800]   rigid attention to the JVM,
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.880]   which Oracle has not given Java, it's a nightmare.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:19.080]   And I just, it concerns me that you're running
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.440]   arbitrary code on your machine.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.160]   - Is it possible, Leo, that this is instead
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.720]   like just opening up Chrome and opening up--
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.560]   - Having a window.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:27.400]   - A browser window.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   - If it's a Chrome tab, no problem,
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.800]   'cause they are sandboxed.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.440]   - It's just a different display of a tab,
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.440]   and I don't know.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.480]   That's what I assumed it was,
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:37.360]   because when they implemented it on the Chromebook,
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.600]   Pixel, which is a wonderful machine,
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.960]   I've never told you that recently.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:44.520]   Right, it's like the other tab, it just--
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:45.840]   - Right, but that's the Chromebook,
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.360]   which is Windows 8, this is a little bit different.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.160]   - I understood it, I understood, but--
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.440]   - Like right now I'm talking to you on Hangouts.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.560]   - I wasn't concerned until Gina said it could access files,
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.400]   it can run the camera, it could, oh, I see.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.480]   - Yeah, but like, you know, I love Adobe Air do that,
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:01.480]   I'd love to something.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:04.280]   - Yeah, and it's a huge security issue.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.600]   - Right.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.320]   - Yes, you do, and it's a very big security issue.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:11.000]   - But no more than a real security issue.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.120]   - No more than the other native app that I install
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.120]   on my Windows desktop, I mean, any native app has access to.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.720]   - The difference is, because it's coming from,
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.000]   it's a conduit to the internet, which is the problem, right?
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.880]   So native apps that don't interact
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:25.600]   with the internet are potentially a problem,
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.080]   but much less so.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.080]   - But every native app these days has some sort of
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.760]   on that update that comes home, connects to the internet, right?
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.240]   I mean-- - Yeah, all right, nevermind.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.040]   - I don't know. - It's secure.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.520]   - If I'm gonna trust anybody to create a runtime
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.280]   for my computer, it's-- - Does Google vet
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:44.040]   the apps, the extensions, how much does Google vet?
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.760]   - You have to get them to the web store,
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.120]   so I imagine that they do, and I imagine APIs
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.840]   are pretty well defined. - Good, that's probably fine.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:54.160]   - This changes what Chrome is, dramatically.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.600]   - So that's the whole conversation,
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:58.760]   is this Google's style, is this why Google put so much
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.280]   attention on Chrome OS, which was baffling all of us?
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.000]   It's a browser, it's a browser, it's a browser,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.720]   but what it really is, is a platform.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.400]   Is it a runtime, an OS, a platform, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.720]   - Is it? - Yeah, I mean,
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:13.480]   this brings Chrome a lot closer to what Android is, right?
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.000]   - This is where you're gonna have trouble though,
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.600]   because, okay, it's safe as long as it can't do anything
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.160]   that Chrome can't do, but if you're gonna make
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.240]   these standalone apps, then you want it to do more,
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.080]   and that's where Java got into trouble, right?
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.000]   Is that, okay, well, now we're competing as an app,
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.440]   now we're an app, well, then you're gonna have
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.000]   to be able to do some more stuff.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:36.840]   - Right.
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.080]   - That's what concerns me.
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.520]   - Well, in other words, if Google's making itself
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.600]   an operating system vendor, then there's all the woes
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.960]   that that is, and the whole point of Chrome OS was
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.400]   how secure it was, because it's so limited, right?
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:55.040]   - Here's the difference I think, potentially, potentially.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.960]   Architecturally, is that Chrome is always connected,
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.240]   and so a lot of the functions that you worry about
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.280]   are not gonna happen on your machine,
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.200]   and they're gonna happen up somewhere in the cloud.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.040]   - Right.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:10.360]   - Versus those apps you talked about were apps
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.840]   that were standalone machine disconnected would work.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.880]   There's a lot on Chrome, you cannot do the only two things
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.720]   I can do with disconnected on Chrome are email and docs.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.560]   That's it.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.760]   Right, everything else requires connection,
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.400]   and the connection is the path to security, I think.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.360]   Maybe.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.760]   - Connection is the path to security.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.760]   - That's exactly what it's just.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.560]   - I think you can argue the opposite as well.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.760]   - No, this is exactly what it says.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.360]   - Here's why, here's what I'm trying to say.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.200]   It's because it's--
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.920]   - 'Cause he's saying server-side code is safer.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.360]   - It's not using machine.
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.200]   - Yeah.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.040]   - It's not using machine.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.440]   - And that may be true, server-side code may be safer.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.280]   Maybe.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:47.920]   - I'm speculating about the architecture.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920]   - Code is code.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:53.200]   If it has access to your local computers,
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.280]   hardware resources.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.640]   - I mean, Google already puts out an operating system
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.000]   that natively accesses your computers.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.280]   It just happens to be the smaller computers, right?
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.880]   I mean, Android already does this.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.320]   What's interesting is that this brings Chrome and Android
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.040]   so close together.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.800]   I mean, you can no longer say the Android's operating system
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.200]   in Chrome is the browser, right?
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.440]   - Right.
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:15.360]   - This is a totally different thing.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.680]   And Chrome has offline capabilities right now.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.760]   It has push notifications.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.240]   It has a lot of these capabilities,
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:23.400]   granted only a few native Google apps
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:26.080]   take advantage of these capabilities, but they're there.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.480]   - So is Google going after desktop computing?
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.720]   What is the end game here?
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.360]   - The internet?
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.360]   - Some call it a Trojan.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.720]   The Verge called it Google's Trojan horse.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.480]   How Google will find, will eventually, will take on Windows.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.440]   Is that really what they're looking for here?
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.240]   - That they want to be the operating system
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.720]   that runs all your computers?
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.560]   - Right.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.400]   - They want to be the platform that runs all your computers.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:51.640]   - That doesn't make sense because you still need to run on OS.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:53.940]   I mean, even Chrome runs on Linux.
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:55.760]   - Right.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.840]   Yep.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.280]   I think that this is a way for developers
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:03.200]   to run on Linux. - You got Linux under there?
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.480]   - Well, but then why do I have to, I know, but why--
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.920]   - You're installing an interface to it.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.560]   It's just installing an interface to it.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.400]   - Oh, is that what it is?
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.400]   We're still calling on the same things.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.120]   Okay. - It's the Linux kernel there.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:12.960]   - Never mind.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:13.800]   That was the stupid moment.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:14.640]   - Isn't it?
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.480]   - At the Eugene.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.320]   - I may be wrong.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.160]   I thought it was.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.960]   - They're trying to make the language of developing all apps
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.960]   or native desktop apps web technologies,
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.360]   which many companies have tried many times before.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.680]   They're trying to make Chrome, the platform
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:29.520]   for running these apps.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:32.320]   They're trying to deliver the original vision of Java,
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.040]   which was this right one's run anywhere.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.680]   If Chrome runs on everything and I'm a developer
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.520]   and I can make a native app that runs the same way
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.040]   and very well and behaves like a native app
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.480]   in that it can access the webcam and do notifications.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:50.120]   And it doesn't look like a browser app,
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.800]   then I'm gonna choose to do that.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.520]   And that just means that Chrome gets installed everywhere,
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.520]   which is only good for Google, right?
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.080]   - And the app has to be updated
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.120]   automatically.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:00.960]   There's no choice.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.720]   - That's true too, which is great.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.520]   - Right, and that will happen through the web store.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.360]   - Here's what they--
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.480]   - It's like a happy new new play store.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.320]   - Sorry about that.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.920]   Here's what they say on the package apps page.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.000]   What are package apps?
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.920]   Package apps deliver and experience as capable
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.360]   as a native app, but as safe as a web page.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.440]   By the way, this is exactly the come on of Java.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:24.160]   Just like web apps, package apps are written HTML5
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:27.200]   JavaScript and CSS, but packaged apps look and behave
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.760]   like native apps and have native like capabilities.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.200]   They're much more powerful than those available to web pages.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.720]   That's what concerns me, the much more powerful
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:37.400]   than those available to web apps.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.080]   - What did you buy the NSA?
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.400]   - Well, this is always the balance.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.040]   As long as it's just a web page,
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.640]   but as soon as you give it hardware access,
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.880]   then it's more like ActiveX.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.240]   And yeah, JavaScript isn't inherently secure.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.480]   It's just it's code.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.720]   So, packaged apps load locally.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.720]   This allows the apps to be less dependent on the network.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.840]   Once a user installs an app, they have full control
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:05.400]   over the apps lifecycle apps open and close quickly,
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.120]   but the system can shut down apps at any time
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.520]   to improve performance.
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.360]   Users can fully uninstall apps.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:14.160]   They're modified web apps, same code,
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.480]   frameworks, tools of the web platform.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.200]   Some browser features have been removed,
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.840]   other web APIs disabled or changed to improve security
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.280]   and programming practices.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.680]   You know, it's all in the implementation.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.520]   - You bought it.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.800]   - That's all in the implementation.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.640]   It could be good.
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:30.640]   - Absolutely.
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:32.080]   - Right now to your consternation,
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:35.720]   I'm talking to you from a web page
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.960]   that attaches to my hardware.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.480]   My camera, you're running code.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.280]   I mean, come on, you're just running code.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:43.120]   - Yeah.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.320]   - Right, web pages have a natural,
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.880]   there's very few things,
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.000]   there are a lot of things you can't do
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:49.840]   when you write a web page.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.800]   Leo, you're saying that you don't like that.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.400]   - They're saying they wanna do more.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:54.240]   Yeah, they wanna do.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.000]   - If you're taking away the browser sandbox, right?
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.840]   There are only certain things you can do.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.880]   You can only access cookies from the sites
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:41:59.720]   that you put them down
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.360]   and you can only execute code, you know,
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.000]   that does certain things.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.480]   I mean, most browsers will just prevent you
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.120]   from doing certain things.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.960]   Accessing the file system on their own
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.800]   and that kind of thing.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.640]   It's all in a sandbox.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:11.480]   Right, and this one has,
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.220]   this takes that code out of that sandbox.
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:17.440]   But hey, you know, this is a conversation
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.280]   we've been having, right?
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.440]   Like there's always that trade-off of security
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.280]   versus convenience.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.320]   I mean, these apps, it's just,
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.120]   it is all just code, right?
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.680]   And this code is gonna be...
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:32.840]   - The issue is how much permission the code has to access,
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.560]   what hardware resources?
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.280]   - Right, what permissions models like,
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]   how that's implemented.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.120]   And this is all...
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.760]   - Who's responsible for this?
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   - Yeah, and this is about Google.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.200]   I mean, Google has a lot of experience with this, right?
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.840]   With Android, I mean, Android has some of the,
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:48.040]   you know, some of the best permission modeling out there.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.240]   As far as I'm concerned, you know, with Android,
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.240]   they've got a lot of experience with this.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.880]   They've got the Chrome OS out already.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.120]   So they're already running Chrome as native.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:56.480]   I know that's on top of Linux,
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.800]   but still Chrome OS,
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.440]   access is the file system in the webcam
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.200]   and all those things natively.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.600]   I don't know, I think this is an interesting,
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.320]   I think this is a really interesting proposal.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.640]   I wonder if Chrome apps are ever gonna run on Android.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.640]   Talk about that.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.360]   - Isn't that interesting?
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:15.000]   - That's at OS inside an OS.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.960]   - Yes, yes.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.480]   Yep, I wonder which operating system
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.400]   is gonna win in the end.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.120]   I mean, don't you feel like eventually
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.920]   Google is gonna have to choose between one or the other?
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:30.160]   - If you're Sundar Pritchei,
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.480]   what are you thinking the world looks like
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.040]   in three to five years?
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.280]   - Yeah, that's a big question.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:36.880]   - Well, part of this isn't this part of it
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.440]   because Google has until recently felt like
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:41.160]   they've lost control of Android.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:42.320]   I think they've reasserted it.
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:43.560]   I think with Jelly Bean,
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:47.320]   Android now is, the best Android experience
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.880]   is the Google Android experience.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.760]   And I think people are gonna realize that.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.040]   But I think this might have been a defensive action
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.560]   against what looked like was gonna happen until recently,
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:59.440]   which was that vendors, even like Samsung,
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.040]   were just gonna take Android and say,
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.480]   "Thanks Google, see ya."
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.680]   We'll create all our own apps.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.360]   You don't need the G apps anymore.
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.000]   And we don't need to be tied to Google
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]   and they were gonna lose control of Android.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.620]   And in that case, Chrome was their,
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:14.480]   their defense.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.960]   But now they're stuck 'cause you know what?
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.080]   And Google is gonna keep Android
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:21.920]   because you know what?
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:22.760]   It's a great experience.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.600]   It's the best experience.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.440]   Everybody agrees.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.520]   The best Android experience is now the Google experience.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:28.360]   - Yeah.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.600]   - It may be not in China, but in the US anyway.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:35.960]   Just so the fact that Amazon's Kindle uses Android
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.840]   but doesn't defer to Google is no longer as much of a concern.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.560]   I think it was as it was to have been until recently.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.640]   Do you think they'll abandon Android?
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.440]   Not as if it's a success and they're making money on it
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.560]   and they clearly are making a lot of money on Android.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.600]   Do they break that down in the quarterly report?
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.200]   You know, the results, do they say how much they make
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.040]   from Android?
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:56.880]   I bet they don't.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.600]   - I don't think so.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.880]   - That's interesting.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:03.160]   It's gotta be a profit center for them.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:04.000]   What's wrong?
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.920]   If you're Google and you're cocky, don't forget,
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.120]   what's wrong with having two OS's?
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.440]   Apples two OS's?
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:13.680]   Microsoft has two OS's?
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.520]   What's wrong with that?
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.360]   You can do that.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.400]   - Page is so--
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.240]   - Focus.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.640]   - So yeah, he's all about focus these days.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.680]   I think that this is, then I think there's tension.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.280]   I think there's tension in terms of resources.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.520]   I think there's tension in terms of vision
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.800]   and in terms of UX and page is all about
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.960]   kind of converging those things
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.080]   and cutting off other products
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:35.960]   and having a similar design vision across products.
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.000]   So I definitely think that there's a tension
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000]   inside Google between Android and Chrome
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.720]   which have both been runaway successes
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.920]   in very different ways and both started out
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:44.960]   in very different ways.
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:46.200]   Chrome starts out as a browser
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.800]   and Android starts out as a mobile operating system
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.280]   and Android was an acquisition.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.960]   - Actually, an awake Chrome was too
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:52.960]   because it was WebKit, right?
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.280]   So it wasn't an in-house development.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.160]   - Right, right, not a fork.
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.520]   I shouldn't say WebKit fork, but well now it's a fork.
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.360]   - It is now.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.720]   - A blink is a fork.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.080]   Yeah, yeah, both of them.
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:05.920]   - I think you're right, Gina.
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:08.920]   - On open source technologies, it's very interesting.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.640]   - When they were separate divisions under separate heads,
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.640]   I think you could argue that there was creative tension
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.680]   at work putting them both under a Sundar.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.200]   Like, gotta guess his job is to figure out which one wins.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.280]   - Really?
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.120]   Why?
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:21.960]   Why choose?
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.840]   - So, clearly there's two stores, there's a Chrome Web Store,
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.800]   there's a Play Store, you have now--
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.160]   - You just finished saying to Larry, what's Unity?
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.200]   - I didn't say that.
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.040]   - She did that.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:32.880]   - She did that.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.080]   - I don't know, I don't see why you would kill one.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.040]   I don't want Chrome OS on this.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.240]   - Not kill, not kill, not kill,
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.240]   but one has a theoretical preeminence
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:47.640]   that Android will run on Chrome or Chrome will run on Android.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:49.520]   And right now Chrome runs on Android.
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:53.440]   And where are you rating apps for in that world?
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.400]   And why?
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.800]   - I'd feel safer with Android.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:58.680]   I would love to run as I do with Bluestacks Android apps
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.400]   on my Chromebook, I'd be very interested in that.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.240]   Wouldn't you?
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:06.680]   - And the Chromecast is an Android build with Chrome on top.
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.520]   (laughing)
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:08.360]   Right?
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.200]   - Yeah, it's both.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.040]   - It's kind of amazing.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.400]   - That's right, right.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:16.160]   Meanwhile, there are as of today six new Chromebooks
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.480]   and three new manufacturers.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:20.320]   - I hear that HP is gonna do a Chromebook.
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.480]   So where do we find the list
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:23.400]   of all the different new Chromebooks?
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.280]   - They don't really say a lot about them,
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.960]   but they're all based on the Haswell.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:27.800]   So--
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.120]   - That's very good news, by the way.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:34.120]   That's a fast processor, fourth generation processor.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.960]   And great battery life too.
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:41.720]   The HP is 14 inches.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.040]   14 inch Chromebook full size,
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.760]   299 from HP.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:47.400]   - Oh, I didn't see the details.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.680]   Ooh.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:49.520]   - Yeah.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.040]   - And while Android devices fly off the shelves,
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.520]   I mean, are they actually, sorry, Jeff,
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:54.920]   are they selling these Chromebooks?
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.000]   - Yeah, yeah, well, I think they are.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.680]   It's the number one computer on Amazon.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:01.520]   Is it?
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.440]   - Under 300 bucks, it's 25% of the market.
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:05.400]   And I'm rooting my numbers for the screw up.
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.640]   And they're in 5,000 schools,
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.800]   which is 20% of the district.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:11.400]   It's a good choice for schools, I think.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.320]   Very good choice for education.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.640]   - Yeah.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.680]   - But I think internationally,
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.880]   if once connectivity is good in a country,
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:22.240]   this shows you the way to go.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.680]   - So it's a 14 inch screen, which is--
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:25.520]   - The HP.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.720]   - This is the HP.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.760]   Three USB two ports, RJ45.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.680]   It's got ethernet.
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:35.800]   Wow, you don't have that on a Macintosh.
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:36.800]   - I don't have it.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:37.800]   (laughs)
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.680]   - Headphone out, this is for schools.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:44.680]   Clearly, headphone out, microphone in, HDMI, card reader.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:49.240]   299, and you get 100 gigs of Google Drive with it.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:52.760]   - Or is this the old player?
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.840]   - No, this is on HP's site.
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:55.680]   - HP.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:58.520]   - The other is listed?
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.120]   - Well, I just looked for this one first.
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.040]   Let's see, oh, this is a Celeron.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:06.000]   This is an 847 Celeron.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.040]   - Well, that's the existing one.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.360]   - This is not the new one.
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.960]   - Okay, so there are new ones.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:11.800]   - I've been given out enough yet.
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.640]   - Let's see.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:14.480]   - HP, that one's in the stores now.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.600]   Little clunky.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:16.960]   - I didn't know the HP made one.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:18.240]   All right, let's--
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.080]   - Yeah.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.680]   - HP, Acer, ASUS, Toshiba, all announce new Chromebooks.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:32.200]   Let's see, HP Chromebook and the Acer Chromebook are live now.
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:36.680]   This is the HP, oh, it's pretty.
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:40.480]   14-inch display, .81 inches thick.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.280]   Four pounds, the hell is in there?
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.800]   Four pounds.
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:48.280]   What?
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.880]   That's four pounds.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.080]   Doesn't look like it has a price here.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:54.920]   This is--
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:57.120]   - Are you sure this is the Haswell one?
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.120]   - This is the new one, it's on Google's site.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:49:59.960]   - This is the new one, okay.
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.400]   - And this is the Acer 11-inch display,
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:06.920]   smaller display, 2.76 pounds, it's more like it.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:10.040]   Eight and a half hours of a used Samsung.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.280]   That's not new, right?
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.280]   That's the one we saw before.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.440]   Here's-- - Unless they just swap the chip.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.160]   - Acer, four hours of battery, forget about it.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.160]   - That's the old one, that's the old one.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.000]   - These are the old ones.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.080]   - They're going back to the old ones now.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:29.080]   So, this is the new Acer 11-inch display,
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.960]   100 gigs of Google Drive, eight and a half hour.
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.000]   I like the battery life, these must be Haswell,
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.080]   because this is during the battery life.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.400]   They've doubled the battery life on some of these.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.900]   299.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:45.680]   That's pretty colorful.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:49.240]   This is, see is for kids.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.400]   They love the color, they love the color.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.120]   I, you know, I think every,
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.480]   this is what school should be using, not an iPad,
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.360]   not Windows, not a MacBook Air.
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.800]   - Well, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let's play back
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.240]   the tape when I made fun of the LA school system
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:08.480]   getting iPads.
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:10.240]   - iPads, I did too.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.120]   - You do? - Oh, yes.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.600]   - Okay. - You don't mistake me
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:16.040]   for thinking that was a good $30 million deal.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.240]   - Oh, all right. - That was terrible.
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:20.240]   And they bought it with a bond, a 30 year bond.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.480]   They'll be paying for iPads.
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.480]   - You still may have been baiting me about the Chromebook,
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.320]   though.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.360]   - No, no, no, I think the Chromebook's good for education.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.560]   I've never, I've always thought it.
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.680]   That's, it's good for unlimited environments,
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:32.400]   like education, a business where the IT department
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:33.960]   doesn't want to mess with it.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:34.800]   - Yep, yep.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.600]   - I don't think they're good for anybody who,
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:37.960]   as a home computer,
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:42.200]   but I think this is great for schools.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:44.440]   - It's nice to see schools come around from, you know,
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.560]   installing Netnanny and limiting access to the internet
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:49.000]   to buying a computer that's based on a browser.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000]   - Right, but I'm on the, I'm on the education Chromebook
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.960]   Google group and it's hilarious to see what the IT guys
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:58.360]   will do to, or the security guys will do to the poor person
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:51:59.960]   who's implementing Chromebooks.
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:00.800]   - Really?
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:01.640]   - Oh, no.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.000]   - Oh, yeah, stupid stuff.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:03.840]   Oh, what about this?
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:04.680]   What about that?
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:06.120]   No, no, that's what Windows machines you have to worry about.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:06.960]   This is different.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:11.320]   It's a browser and the need for Google
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:15.680]   to help them educate their colleagues is great.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:19.200]   - The HP is gonna be $2.99 available in white turquoise
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:20.520]   and peach.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.000]   Unfortunately, a low res 14 inch screen,
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.640]   1366 by 768, so that's a little bit disappointing.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:30.520]   16 gigs of storage and of course it's not touch.
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.080]   I still am looking for something somewhere in between this
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:33.920]   and the pixel.
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:34.760]   - That's what's needed.
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:36.240]   Yes, that's absolutely what's needed.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:40.680]   How much does it add in expense to do a touch screen?
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:42.200]   - Oh, a lot, I think.
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:44.040]   That's a $500.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:47.160]   We don't see any sub $500 touch screens.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:50.200]   I don't think, well, some missing something.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:53.320]   - What's the cheapest 10 inch tablet though?
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.160]   - Oh gosh, there's lots of cheaper ones.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.000]   There's two.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:57.840]   - That's what I'm saying.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:59.280]   If you can do a tablet at a low price.
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:03.840]   - Yeah, $20 to add a touch screen to a laptop
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:05.640]   says MavHC in the chat room.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:10.240]   All right, let's move on.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:13.560]   Motorola says they're shipping 100,000,
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.560]   I'm sorry, 99,999 Moto X phones from Texas,
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.960]   'cause one came back from Jeff.
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:23.220]   (laughing)
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:25.460]   (laughing)
[01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:30.460]   That seems like a decent amount, not huge.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:32.820]   I would say that's probably as considered
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:35.660]   Motorola probably considered as success.
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:36.500]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.340]   - Yeah.
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:41.780]   Why do that thing follow?
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.740]   - Well, here's back to Apple for one quick second.
[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:45.780]   Do you think that there are gonna be lines
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:47.660]   at the store for Apple or are we over that phone?
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:49.340]   - Oh, that's a good question actually.
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.420]   Because Apple did something which I cannot think of why
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:53.820]   they did it except to encourage lines.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:57.220]   They allow you to pre-order the 5C on the 13th
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:58.820]   for delivery on the 20th.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:01.100]   They do not allow you to pre-order the 5S.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.540]   You have to go to a store to get it
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:04.580]   if you wanna get it on the 20th.
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:06.740]   Is that, I mean, there can't be any reason
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:08.420]   for that except we want a line.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:11.220]   - Give it up. - Which sucks.
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.740]   - It does. - That's like,
[01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.340]   oh yeah, we're gonna sacrifice our customers
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.600]   for better marketing.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:18.860]   - That sucks. - They just wanna
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:20.220]   get you on the-- - Yeah.
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.900]   - They wanna get the folks who are willing to spend
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.620]   a lot more money for the 5S, the hard core,
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.020]   the grownups with a little extra cash,
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.340]   the people who are really hardcore
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:30.340]   on the powerful device, they want them in the doors
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:32.020]   that they buy some more stuff.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:33.420]   But yeah, I agree. - No, that sucks.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:34.260]   - That's a really line thing.
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:35.460]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.380]   - No, no, I'm not saying it's--
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:38.780]   - As somebody who, I waited in line for the first two,
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:42.260]   but as somebody who in the last couple of years
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:44.020]   has just pre-ordered it the week before
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.940]   and it comes on that day, that's beautiful.
[01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:48.220]   I don't have to get up out of my seat.
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:50.900]   I think to screw your customers
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:53.460]   so that you get better coverage in the local news
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:54.860]   at six o'clock, it's stupid.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:56.900]   That's very frustrating.
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:58.580]   And it's not supply constraints.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.460]   I don't see how making people come to the store
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:01.820]   has anything to do with that.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:05.300]   I think you're right, Gina.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.900]   It's the lines, but it's also getting people
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:08.660]   in the store so that they buy the case
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.940]   and they buy the table. - If I the case,
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:10.780]   they pick up the-- - And oh,
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:12.580]   it's gonna I, Mac, while we're here.
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:14.060]   They're so pretty.
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:15.020]   - Pick up an air.
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:16.860]   Oh, I have a meaner look at these ninnies.
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:17.700]   Yeah. (laughs)
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:19.780]   - Let's spend $23,000.
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:23.660]   Yeah, I just think that's disappointing.
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.820]   - Have the retail experience.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.820]   - Unless I'm missing something,
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:28.020]   then there's some reason why this makes sense.
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:31.060]   It sounds to me like pure marketing and that's sad.
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.100]   - I wonder too about the plans.
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:35.340]   They put up the list of all the plans for the iPhones
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.860]   and there's a ridiculous one.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:41.700]   I think it's AT&T has like a $500 a month plan.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.700]   You don't have to get unlimited data.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.540]   - What do you get?
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:46.180]   - You get unlimited-- - It's cold.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:51.180]   - You get messages and you get 50 gigs of data.
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:56.340]   Now I pay though this was a whole 'nother rant.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:57.620]   When I switched phones back and forth,
[01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:01.340]   I go to the AT&T store to say,
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:02.660]   I need to switch this device.
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:04.860]   I have an unlimited plan.
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.660]   Don't effort my unlimited plan.
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:09.140]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.460]   - Mook, you mook, you mook.
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:12.180]   (laughs)
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:13.380]   - Hey, no problem.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:14.300]   We could do whatever you want.
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:16.100]   - So guess what, of course,
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:17.820]   I get a message at one in the morning,
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:20.580]   you're out of data, you fool, you have no plan.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.420]   - Oh.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.220]   (sighs)
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:26.220]   - And I'm psychotic enough, this keeps me up.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:30.900]   I go to Twitter, I go over, it's Friday night.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:33.460]   I got other stuff going on.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:37.620]   I spent 39 minutes on the phone with them to get it switched
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:41.020]   and they told me it was gonna take 21 days to switch it.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.100]   It did happen the next day
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:43.700]   'cause I suspect somebody looked Twitter and looked like,
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.820]   "Oh, yeah, he's raving again.
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:47.900]   Could he get him this time?"
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:49.100]   Anyway, sorry.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:50.260]   (laughs)
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.100]   - That's funny.
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:52.180]   - T-Mobile looks better and better.
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:55.620]   - I love T-Mobile, go to T-Mobile on your Nexus 5.
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:57.380]   - Plus one.
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:00.220]   - Plus one.
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:01.980]   Is that what the new thing that we're all doing?
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:02.980]   Plus one.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:04.100]   - Plus one.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:05.820]   - Yeah, the iOS 7 release is actually
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:06.980]   really big deal for developers.
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:08.740]   This is the week where developers are scrambling
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:09.660]   to be together. - The 18th,
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:11.340]   you got one week, kids.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.180]   - It'll work, yeah.
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:15.220]   - You got one week to get your act together there.
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:18.060]   - Yeah, I mean, my app is a very standard list.
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:19.220]   We're not doing anything too crazy.
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:20.260]   We're doing anything too custom,
[01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:21.860]   but it looks totally different, iOS 7,
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:23.900]   and we definitely have to make some changes.
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:24.980]   - Color, Gina, color.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:26.780]   - Do they give you a palette that says,
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.260]   "This is the color palette," or how does that work?
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:31.020]   - We use the standard UI views
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.660]   with the standard default colors.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:37.260]   So the gray chrome is now just flat white,
[01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:39.020]   and the button labels are just changed into the--
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:40.340]   So it just--
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:41.180]   - It just--
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:44.740]   - It changed to that, to the default system colors are.
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:47.340]   So I didn't really look beyond that.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:50.380]   You can definitely, there's gotta be a way to customize,
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:51.220]   choose your own colors.
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:52.660]   If your app has its own palette,
[01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:54.860]   or has its own styles, we would choose the default,
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:57.740]   but if you're using any of the default Apple styles
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:00.700]   for your settings area or anything,
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:02.540]   those look pretty different now.
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:04.140]   - I would stick with the default,
[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:07.820]   because you don't wanna pick a color that clashes or something.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:10.580]   If people are buying iOS 7,
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:12.380]   you wanna look like iOS 7.
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:13.300]   - Oh yeah, that's the right one.
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.660]   - You don't wanna be the center.
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:16.060]   - Oh no, I want everything to be.
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:19.180]   - Skewomorphic.
[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:20.580]   - Right.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:21.940]   - Right.
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:22.780]   - Or have depth right now.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:24.900]   - Don't you love it that as Apple is abandoning all leather
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:29.340]   and stitching, the Galaxy Note 3 has a stitched pleather back?
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:30.260]   - Yeah.
[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:31.260]   - Yeah.
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:33.220]   - Something for everyone.
[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:35.220]   We're all about choice here at Samsung.
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:38.660]   - Speaking of Samsung, I went to an event in New York this week.
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:41.180]   They're opening a new incubator in New York,
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:42.740]   the different incubator model.
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:43.900]   Old friend of mine, you're PentaChardon,
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:44.980]   I'm starting the company there.
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:46.300]   It was neat.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:50.420]   - An incubator for mobile focus companies?
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:52.020]   - No, they didn't sell it all.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:52.860]   - New companies.
[01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:54.540]   - They didn't have a developer conference
[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:56.380]   or have they had that yet?
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:57.380]   - I don't think they had it yet.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:58.220]   - Now it's October.
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:59.060]   - I guess it's October.
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:01.580]   They didn't announce the developer conference.
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:03.940]   - What did you guys think about the new Yahoo logo?
[01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:09.740]   - I have to give props to Marissa Myers,
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:11.420]   Geeky blog post.
[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:12.260]   - Yeah.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:16.420]   - Renee Ritchie, who was a designer in an earlier life, said,
[01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:18.260]   "Are you kidding?
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:19.820]   "Correll draw bezels?
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:23.660]   "This is the best Marissa could come up with."
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.580]   They had an intern.
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:26.420]   What is it?
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:28.020]   Rex our intern did a video.
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:33.020]   This is, I've got to read the pros and this.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:35.980]   And I admire Marissa Meyer.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:40.700]   I don't want to make fun of her, but...
[01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:44.220]   - I really liked that she thanked her intern,
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:47.580]   but this did feel very much like a case of,
[01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:50.460]   "You don't know what you don't know."
[01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:51.300]   - Yeah.
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:52.460]   - So one weekend, this is what she wrote.
[01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:53.940]   So one weekend this summer,
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:56.980]   "I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches
[01:59:56.980 --> 02:00:00.340]   "with our logo design team, Bob and Mark and Russ,
[02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:01.660]   "and our intern Max.
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:03.540]   "We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday
[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:04.740]   "designing the logo.
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:07.220]   "We spent the whole weekend from start to finish,
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:11.260]   "and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail."
[02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:16.260]   - Oh, you don't want the logo to be a thing you do
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:17.100]   over the weekend.
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:18.100]   - Over the weekend!
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:18.940]   - Over the summer!
[02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:19.780]   - Yeah, like I don't think you should realize
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:21.940]   it sounded so trivialized.
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:24.820]   And I just, I mean, the designer folks in my circle
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:27.460]   are friends, we're just absolutely appalled.
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:29.300]   - All the designer hate it.
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:32.900]   For instance, this is an example that Renee,
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:34.580]   I'm not a designer, I don't know.
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:35.420]   It looks good to me.
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:36.260]   - Yeah, me neither.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:37.100]   - I'm a moke.
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:38.100]   - I don't love the bezel, but yeah.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.100]   - Yeah, the bezel is dumb.
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:42.440]   So apparently-- - The typography
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:43.980]   doesn't offend me, but the bezel is bad.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:46.260]   - But, well, the designers were totally offended
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:51.260]   by the typography because they wanted mathematically
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:54.460]   all the letters to be the right, you know,
[02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:57.680]   a programmer would say, yeah, they didn't do any kerning.
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:00.860]   They, a typographer wants kerning.
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:03.220]   The programmer in them wants them to be uniform,
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:05.020]   and that's not how you do it.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:08.000]   - You know what, the millions of users out there
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:08.880]   couldn't give a cry.
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:09.720]   - I know, it's just--
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:11.660]   - Yeah, no one-- - They don't even notice.
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.500]   - No.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.340]   (laughing)
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:16.980]   - This does kind of harken back to that post
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:18.460]   from a designer who was at Google,
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:21.900]   who said that Google would test every shade of blue,
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:24.540]   that it was a data-driven decision.
[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:26.460]   It wasn't about design.
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.820]   And yeah, Maya brought that, I think,
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:31.780]   a little bit to this logo design.
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:33.740]   - And here you go, our last move,
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:37.420]   we decided to tilt the exclamation point by nine degrees
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.920]   just to add a bit of whimsy.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:42.400]   Oh, Lord.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.120]   Well, you're right, it doesn't really matter.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:44.920]   Go ahead, Marissa.
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:47.680]   You're doing so many good things for Yahoo.
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.680]   I really like the new Yahoo weather app.
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:53.240]   And so, you know, we'll forgive her,
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.200]   playing around a little bit with the typography.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:59.240]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, she's making the company her own.
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:00.120]   That's good. - Yep.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:02.840]   - Wish she had gotten rid of the exclamation point.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:03.680]   - No, same here. - Apparently,
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:04.720]   that wasn't on the table.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:05.720]   That was not on the table. - Yeah,
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:06.560]   but that wasn't on the table.
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.400]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:11.600]   Wow. - It's not terrible.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:12.920]   - It's not, I don't know.
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.260]   I'm not a designer.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:17.080]   Renee, who is, there you go, there's a little tilt.
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:20.240]   Renee, who is a designer, said it's horrendous.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.160]   But designers are given to hyperbole
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:25.600]   when it comes to design, right?
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:26.960]   - Oh, yes.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.520]   - He was a fed-- - I'm a fern freak.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:31.360]   The curtain between the Y and the Y is a little bit wrong.
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:33.400]   - It's wrong, yeah, the curtain is wrong.
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:36.680]   - Curning's done by a non-typographer.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:38.760]   All right, I think we should do one more ad
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.600]   and then come back with our tip tool number of the week.
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:41.480]   Jeff, you'll find a number.
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:42.880]   I see numbers all over the--
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:44.040]   - I've got 'em, no, I've got 'em, I've got 'em.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.680]   - All right, all right.
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:47.040]   And I've got a-- - Well, you might want,
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.960]   or maybe the end of the show,
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.600]   the Airbnb movie is fun.
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.320]   - All right, we'll play it at the end of the show.
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:55.280]   They're taking crowd supplied vines
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.440]   to do a little Airbnb ad.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:00.480]   Our show today brought to you by,
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.760]   and this is goodtimingsquarespace.com.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.840]   The secret behind, I bet you, I should try this.
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:09.520]   I bet you you can embed Google+ in Squarespace.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.240]   Google+ works in Squarespace, they say.
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:16.160]   Squarespace is really a great place.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.040]   It's hosting plus the best content management system
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.880]   to make a wonderful site that'll never go down.
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.880]   We asked people to tweet us with your Squarespace website.
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.120]   I'd love to show some sites on the show
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:31.680]   at some point.
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.280]   Just use the hashtag #TwitSquarespace
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:35.320]   and we'll take a look,
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.440]   and we'll mention some of your sites in future shows.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.720]   One of the reasons I do that is 'cause what's neat is
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:42.040]   they have these wonderful templates.
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.520]   You start with 20 beautiful, mobile responsive templates,
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:46.600]   but then you make it your own
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:47.960]   and you don't have to be the designer to do this.
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.400]   You can drag and drop.
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.600]   You can add plugins for all your favorite social networks.
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:55.280]   You can import all your content, including pictures,
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:58.400]   links, even comments from your existing site,
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:03:59.720]   and then get a gorgeous site.
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:02.000]   You can do this all for free because
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.880]   when you click the Get Started button at Squarespace.com,

[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.680]   Take the, they have workshops and tutorials.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:14.680]   If you decide to buy it,
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.160]   it starts at $8 a month with the annual plan
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:20.000]   and you get a free domain name, they hook it up.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.160]   They have commerce for $24 a month,
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:24.440]   and that includes everything,
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.360]   including things like tax calculations,
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.120]   inventory control, shipping calculations.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.040]   I gotta tell you, Squarespace is great.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:32.880]   You gotta try it.
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:35.520]   No credit card required to get two weeks free.

[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.120]   Squarespace.com.
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:51.160]   Offer code TWIG and the number nine, all one word,
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:54.280]   and we thank you Squarespace for your support.
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:57.800]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.880]   - My tip of the week is actually a tool this week.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.840]   A tool that I've started using in artists,
[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:04.000]   it's called Draft.
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.560]   I've got a draftin.com.
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:08.720]   This is a really, really cool web app
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:13.080]   that's basically like GitHub for writers.
[02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:15.600]   So it's a place that you can write a tweet
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:17.720]   or a blog post or an email,
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:20.000]   and then you can send it to say, you know,
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.520]   say I can send it to you Leo.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:23.280]   Say I'm gonna write a post about TWIG,
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.240]   for example, for my blog.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:25.440]   I can send it to you.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.400]   You can propose changes,
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:30.600]   and then I can accept on a change by change basis,
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:33.880]   accept or reject a change over time.
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:35.160]   So it really, it helps you collaborate
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.520]   with others on drafts,
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:39.120]   and then it publishes what you want
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:41.960]   to whatever service that you want.
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:43.040]   So, oh yeah, they actually,
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:45.400]   they also have professional editors that you can,
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:46.800]   you can click that ask professional button,
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:49.080]   you can add a professional editor to look at your writing.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.680]   It's a part of the support's markdown,
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:52.920]   which is great, great for markdown nerds.
[02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:55.240]   And then you can publish to lots of different places.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.960]   You can publish to WordPress, to Tumblr, to Twitter,
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:58.960]   to MailChimp.
[02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:01.640]   So you can, it's basically a place that you,
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:03.040]   it's just a place to write,
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:04.240]   and it's a very, very simple interface,
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:05.840]   very well designed app.
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:09.040]   And it helps you kind of collaborate.
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:10.920]   It saves revision control over time.
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.280]   So it really appeals to me as a nerd writer,
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:15.880]   because it gives me kind of that nice GitHub,
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:17.200]   those nice GitHub features
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:19.720]   without the crazy difficult GitHub,
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:21.880]   GitHub interface.
[02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:24.760]   We interviewed, Kevin and I interviewed the founder draft,
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:26.400]   Nate Conte on one of our,
[02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:28.400]   on the episodes of our show in Beydon, five by five.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:31.080]   And he's a really, really thoughtful guy
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:35.120]   who's just thinks that writing better changes the world,
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.800]   which I agree,
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:39.880]   and has been making this app really for himself,
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:42.440]   and so to encourage more people to write more often.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.840]   And he's really done a nice job with it.
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:46.040]   So check it out, if you're looking for a writing tool,
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:48.000]   I'm actually using it to write some,
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.480]   I'm gonna relaunch my blog and I'm using it to write
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:52.440]   and think about edit and collaborate on some posts
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:53.280]   that I'm working on.
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:54.640]   And I've just been really, really loving it.
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:56.480]   So check it out, it's free to try.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:58.160]   And then you can, I don't know,
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.080]   it's like three bucks a month
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:00.280]   if you want to support the app.
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:01.760]   - This is amazing.
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:03.320]   - Yeah, it's a really nice app.
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:04.320]   He's done a really nice job on it.
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:05.480]   - You know, Amber and I were gonna write a book
[02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:08.040]   we never did, but I set up SVN to keep,
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.560]   it was like a pain in the ass.
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.240]   - Yeah, yeah, it's totally, totally crazy.
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:14.520]   - Yeah, but the idea of using versioning for text
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:16.080]   is a great idea.
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:17.880]   - And it's a much better implementation
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:20.040]   than like words, track changes.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:21.080]   - Everything is in plain text.
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.520]   - I could imagine this role in my faculty.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:27.120]   You could work with a student
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:28.400]   'cause it has editor mode.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:32.160]   So you could have a student submit their papers this way.
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:33.480]   - Yep.
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:36.000]   - Oh my gosh, it uses Markdown.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.160]   This is great, draftin.com.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:42.000]   Oh, I love this.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:42.840]   Too bad I don't write.
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:45.160]   - Emoy was part of Evs' goal with Medium
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.680]   was to allow more collaboration,
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.480]   but in a very simple way, this is much more elegant.
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:51.720]   - Well, I guess the guy who wrote this
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:54.600]   is looking to be acquired by somebody like Ev.
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.600]   With this one. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:56.680]   I wonder, possibly.
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:58.120]   Editorial-ly just launched,
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:59.520]   which I believe is a similar thing.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.160]   I haven't had a chance to try it, but Medium,
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:03.520]   it's kind of neat to see, well,
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:05.200]   especially for someone who loved Wave,
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:07.800]   and I mean, Wave was about collaborating on top two.
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:09.120]   - Yeah, right, yeah.
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:13.520]   - But didn't do it as simply and as easily as this.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.240]   I think that there's definitely a market here,
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:17.520]   and I just think Microsoft Word,
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:18.720]   Track Changes doesn't do it.
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.760]   GitHub version control doesn't quite do it.
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.360]   Version control is great for code.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.200]   Not as easy for pros.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.840]   I think there's definitely a need here.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:30.120]   And yeah, I'm trying to, it's helping me write more.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:31.560]   I find that I write more when I have tools
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:34.640]   that I really enjoy using, and so that alone,
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:35.480]   it's been worth it.
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:36.560]   Medium has a kind of a similar thing, right?
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:37.440]   It's composed features.
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:41.080]   So nice and so slick that it makes you wanna write well.
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:43.160]   And so I've had the same experience as draft.
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:45.560]   - I love his Laura Mipsim.
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:48.960]   - Tootsie Roll, tiramisu, fruitcake wafer.
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:52.280]   Wipe us bon bon, candy, carrot, cake, macaroon,
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.600]   cupcake, candy canes, apple pie.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:57.360]   Sweet bear claw muffin for Warkey.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:59.600]   - No commercial words like Kipcat and arrows.
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:02.040]   - That's just like a string of potential
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:03.360]   of Android, you know, thinking.
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:04.960]   (laughing)
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:07.440]   - Pastry, sesame, snaps, pastry,
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:10.640]   croissant, lemon, drops cheesecake marshmallow.
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:11.480]   Motsapon.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:14.440]   - Can you imagine Android marshmallow?
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.280]   - Mm.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.120]   - Yeah.
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:18.040]   - Yeah.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.880]   - Or Malomar, we'll see.
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:20.960]   - Malomar.
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:21.800]   (laughing)
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:24.560]   - Fans, fans, who they do the deal with, moon pie.
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:29.400]   Yes, I'm using Android moon pie, 7.9.
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:32.360]   Jeff Jarvis' number of the week.
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:36.240]   - Real short, Forrester analyst says that the NSA's
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:41.040]   didleine with our security and safety and privacy
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.160]   and freedom will cost American technology companies
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:45.280]   $180 billion.
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:46.360]   - Oh man.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.400]   Wow.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:49.720]   - But to put that number in perspective,
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:51.760]   Mexico not making it the World Cup
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.920]   will cost them $600 billion.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.840]   So it's all, it's all relative.
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:09:59.680]   - Yeah.
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:02.000]   - I saw that on the soccer game last night.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.080]   Billions and sales, I think that's not surprising.
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:05.800]   In fact, I think that number's way lower.
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:07.640]   - I don't wear the, I think it's where that's going.
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:08.480]   - That's a low number.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.840]   - And it says in the headline, Google,
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:11.120]   and then it only mentions Google in there
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:11.960]   and doesn't say anything.
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:12.800]   - Yeah.
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.680]   - So my tip is a little self-serving.
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.200]   My tool is a little self-serving,
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:21.440]   but there is a new Android app for Twit.
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:23.400]   And I really, yeah.
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:26.320]   And it's nice, it's called Twit Pro.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.480]   And--
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:30.280]   - It won the arena by Jason, put it in the arena
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:31.280]   and it killed all of us.
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:32.120]   Everyone loves it.
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:32.960]   - It's great.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:36.000]   You showed it on all about Android last night, yeah.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000]   It has chat, which is wonderful.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:39.920]   Really easy to use.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.360]   Now we have some great authors doing wonderful
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.880]   Twit apps and I don't want to discourage Houdini 7
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:46.120]   or Fcon or anybody.
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:49.080]   In fact, let the games begin, huh?
[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.200]   But I don't, what's the guy's name?
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:52.760]   I wanna, is it Mark?
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:54.080]   Oh, look, it's us.
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:54.920]   - Oh, that's us.
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:55.760]   - Mark Hampton.
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.600]   Mark Hampton.
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:58.640]   And then here's this calendar on it
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:02.400]   and you can enable chat.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:04.920]   So you can just change your default channel,
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:05.920]   change the stream.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:07.720]   I just think this is nicely done.
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:10.840]   You can watch and watch chat at the same time.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:11.680]   Isn't that cool?
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:13.440]   - I'm gonna hit a look at that.
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:14.800]   - I do the same thing.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.280]   - You showing the app on the app.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:18.120]   - Very meta.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:19.520]   It's gonna get weirder.
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:20.520]   - It is gonna get weird.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:22.880]   - Yeah, it's about to get weird.
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.600]   So it's called Twitch Pro.
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.400]   You can search for it up Play Store.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:32.120]   And what's kind of amazing about it is it's free.
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:33.440]   So thank you.
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:34.680]   - You said great.
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:35.520]   Listeners, man.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.960]   - We have the best, and that's why I don't want
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:39.840]   to tell anybody not to do this.
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:40.920]   Thank you.
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:42.480]   - We really appreciate it.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:45.720]   Very, very nicely done.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:48.120]   He's already updated it a little bit.
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:48.960]   - Awesome.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:50.400]   - Yeah.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:52.520]   Hey, that's it for this week in Google.
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.240]   I hope you enjoyed our show.
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:57.000]   - Oh, Vayaj, excuse me, excuse me.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000]   - Bon vieggio.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.920]   - Oh, you wrote, I was gonna ask Google.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:01.800]   - Oh, wait, we could do it.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:02.880]   Yeah.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:04.080]   Actually, that'd be interesting.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:05.560]   Okay, Google now.
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:08.520]   - How do you say bon vayaj in Italian?
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:12.520]   - What phone are you using, the Nexus?
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:13.520]   - Yeah.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:14.520]   It's there.
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:16.520]   Vayajio Securo.
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:17.520]   - No, really?
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:19.520]   I think it's not colloquial.
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:21.520]   - It says French to Italian.
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:22.520]   - Safe journey.
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:24.520]   Wow, it knew Bon Vaiaj was French.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:25.520]   - Yes.
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:26.520]   - That's amazing.
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:27.520]   - That's amazing.
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.520]   Okay, wait a minute.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:30.520]   I'll try getting one.
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.520]   How do you say, "Who to El Riza in Italian?"
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:37.520]   No, it's how do you say, "Google Raisa."
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.520]   Okay, we'll try that.
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:45.520]   How do you say, "Who to El Riza in Italian?"
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:46.520]   No.
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:47.520]   You know what?
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:50.520]   Recognize bon vieggio in the American dictionary, probably.
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:52.520]   - Yeah, that's probably what it is.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:53.520]   - Have a wonderful trip, Leo.
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:54.520]   - I'm excited.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:55.520]   Have a great moment.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.520]   - I'm gonna miss you guys.
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:57.520]   - You earned it.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:58.520]   Take some time.
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:12:59.520]   Take great photos.
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:00.520]   Eat amazing food.
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:01.520]   It's killing me.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.520]   You're gonna be in Italy.
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:03.520]   It's killing me.
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:04.520]   - I love Italy.
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:06.520]   - And I just hear great things about Turkey too.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:07.520]   - From me.
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:08.520]   - I hear good things about Turkey too.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:10.520]   Yeah, we're going to Conakali and--
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.520]   - Are you taking a gas mask?
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.520]   - No.
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:15.520]   No.
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.520]   I'm gonna boat.
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:17.520]   What could go wrong?
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.520]   - Oh, okay.
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:21.520]   (laughing)
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.520]   - No, I can't-- you know, Syria is just over the border.
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:25.520]   I don't know what's gonna happen.
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.520]   I don't know what's gonna happen.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:29.520]   And I'm not gonna bring my most important computer with all the
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.520]   secrets, the state secrets.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:31.520]   - Chromebooks, yeah.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:32.520]   - Yeah.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:34.520]   Just in case you're worried.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:37.520]   Hey, Jeff Jarvis is at BuzzMachine.com.
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:39.520]   That's where he blogs.
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:42.520]   Soon to be embedding Google links, plus links.
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:44.520]   - With humility.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:45.520]   (laughing)
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:47.520]   - He also is the author of Public Parts.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.520]   What would Google do, Professor of Journalism at the City
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:52.520]   University of New York, and a great guy, and we love you, Jeff.
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:54.520]   He's always a pleasure.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:56.520]   Gina Trapani, we love you too.
[02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:00.520]   She is the blogger at BuzzMach-- I'm sorry, smarterware.org,
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.520]   but also writes ThinkUp app.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:06.520]   ThinkUp.com, a great Twitter analyzation app,
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:11.520]   analysis app, and todotext.com.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:13.520]   Soon to be iOSified.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:14.520]   - iOS 7ified.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:15.520]   - iOS 7ified.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:16.520]   - Yes.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:17.520]   I'll be up this weekend very late.
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:18.520]   - Wow.
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:19.520]   - Going, "Why it isn't at work?
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:20.520]   Why it isn't great?"
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.520]   - Now it should be easy.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.520]   - Yeah, it shouldn't be bad.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.520]   - It should be easy.
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:25.520]   - It's a great though.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:26.520]   Have a great trip, Leo.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:27.520]   We're gonna miss you.
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:28.520]   - I'm gonna miss you guys.
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:29.520]   - Enjoy.
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.520]   - This will be one of the first shows I'll do when I get back
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:31.520]   and I can't wait.
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:32.520]   - Yay.
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:34.520]   - We do this weekend Google on Wednesdays, 1PM Pacific,
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:39.520]   4PM Eastern Time, 2000 UTC on Twitter.tv.

[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:51.520]   You know, on whatever tour you use, including Twitter,

[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.520]   So, see you next time.
