[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.740]   This week in Google. It's always fun to kind of drop into the chair and talk about things outside of well
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.180]   Just Android especially when you see all the people that are on this show
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.140]   It's kind of like an all about Android reunion
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.540]   But for things outside of Android we'll get to that in a second first of all got a welcome back
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.540]   Obviously welcoming back Jeff Jarvis professor at CUNY graduate school of journalism. How's it going Jeff?

[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.860]   I'm excited. Yeah, I love doing all about Android on Tuesdays with you Jason and we miss you Gina and
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.380]   Yeah, it's great to great to talk about things other than Android because I'm not a one trick pony
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.260]   So that's right. Well, and you've been on you've been on tech news today a handful of times
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.460]   And I mean you talk about it all you don't care. I
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.220]   Do my best to stay informed
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.060]   Excellent all right, we've got a lot of stuff here in the doc
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.140]   Actually this being Ron's first time he looked at the doc and he was like whoa
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.820]   We're talking about all this stuff like no, it's okay
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.740]   It's okay. This is a list of all the things that are happening to your tire us to plan the wrong
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.340]   Yeah, exactly exactly. So Jeff, why don't we start with you because you're in your your as you said Anaheim for VidCon
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.100]   And you go there. I think you go there every year. I know you were there last year here
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.980]   so the story is last year I was coming to interview jank youger of young Turks on stage and
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.380]   As I was leaving that morning my daughter is in where you going and I said, oh, hey
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.460]   She's all white going I said I'm gonna stay if you heard of VidCon and her response was
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.540]   Yeah
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.540]   Why the hell aren't you taking me you awful father?
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:53.060]   So I begged Jim Lauterbach. I begged him to please I would I would do anything this year to get back in
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.920]   So I can bring my daughter who's down the hall and and is looking forward to tomorrow and
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.260]   Jim has to be interviewing Sean Atkins who's the new CEO of MTV on stage on Thursday, which I'm really looking forward to and
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.740]   It's an amazing. I don't know. I was looking up the number because I need a number this week
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.620]   Last year was 23,000 people
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.100]   It's phenomenal
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.580]   Just an absolutely packed. There's three floors right the bottom floor is the fans
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.780]   And and and my daughter has a wrist filled with four wrist bands
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.980]   So she can get into the meet and greets with four of her
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:37.100]   Favorite stars the floor above that is creators who make all this stuff the floor above that is the industry that exploits the hell out of the two floors below
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.120]   So I'm here for industry and speaking for the old farts floor
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.960]   But it's really really amazing last year that the big lesson I got last year of being a VidCon that I've
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.380]   Dined out on for the whole year since is that I saw that with these young people video content is not a destination
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.820]   It's not a product. It's not a thing. It's a social token that people use in their own conversations to their own ends
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.540]   And we in media have to figure out how to make things that work similarly
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.380]   And we don't know how to do that because we're egotistical and we think that we are the be all and end all and that's just not the case
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.300]   The relationship that people have to media is very different here the pity of this year is VidCon
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.340]   They did something very very smart something they absolutely had to do
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.700]   I'm very glad they did it, but they had to tighten down on security given the two attacks in Orlando
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.100]   Don't forget the first one was on a you know a popular YouTube star and a tragic murderer
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.780]   So they've really they have 450 security people here this year
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:43.260]   You know the fans won't be able to just mob around there their people to be very organized and the meet and greets
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.180]   It's a real pity that the world comes to this, but that's where we are but nonetheless
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.260]   I'm looking forward to VidCon. It's really well run. That's what indication of how well they really think they're
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.100]   Responsible for a lot of young people here and they think that very seriously. That's a great conference
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:06.140]   You're talking about kind of kind of the state of video obviously VidCon. That's what it's all about and
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.500]   Twitter I believe this happened to VidCon. This was an announcement at VidCon. I think it was yesterday
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.620]   That they're kind of changing some things at least with Twitter's approach to video and then beyond that
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.060]   Vines approach to video. We're all used to vine videos
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.660]   You know being six second short videos
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.300]   And I think they're still staying that way from what I understand from their announcement yesterday of VidCon
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.340]   Is that vine video the the primary vine video that is posted is still six seconds
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:40.220]   But you can post related videos that are opening up that restriction from six seconds out to what is it?
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:48.180]   40 seconds long so lengthening it out so all you so yet again these video services or you know services
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:54.940]   Social networks that are serving video are getting closer and closer to being kind of the same thing to each other
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.420]   I don't know. I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.580]   But it's well, it's funny because I know I know that you know
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:06.820]   There's a huge following on vine of people who love the six second limit and have been incredibly creative in using it
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:12.460]   And there are people who you know are specific you know specifically vine creators because of that limitation and you know
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.340]   There's always that die-hard audience who just loves you know
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.700]   What you know that this is the platform they came up on and they don't want to see anything change of it
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.180]   But for me as a content like I'm not I'm not an active user of vine
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.500]   I probably I watch a video on snapchat more than I watch on vine
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.540]   But I think having the option to do extended videos is a good idea and it just shows that you know
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.020]   They you know these companies have to evolve because it's funny because Jeff
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.820]   I wanted to ask you you know is VidCon how much of an emphasis on YouTube is there in VidCon or is it
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.940]   Complete because I've never been is it supportive of other platforms like vine and Vimeo and what what not?
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:53.420]   They talk about it all I think that John and Hank Green intended to start it as a as a YouTube thing
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.140]   But decided just oh what the hell let's make it broader than that and
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.980]   Smart that they did but yes YouTube is gigantic here Susan Wojcicki the CEO gives a keynote last year
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.980]   She did this year she will again
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:12.860]   This is YouTube space, but but it's everything else is as well my favorite thing in the in the old farts industry track tomorrow morning
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.380]   There's a half-hour primer to us old farts about how do you snapchat?
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.460]   Hmm and it's it's essential
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.460]   Actually, it's because it's it's oh
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.700]   Yeah, I've been playing with it for the past couple of months and and the first month was rough
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.900]   It was I mean less at all as as as a as a as a burgeoning old fart Jeff
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.900]   I was I found it to be
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:40.980]   But um but I've but after a couple of months of using it
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.940]   I've actually been enjoying it a lot and some of the you know some of my friends who I follow really good at it
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.140]   And I I think the stuff they've been doing content is really interesting is really compelling
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.860]   But yeah, it does it does it's a bit of a Rubik's Cube to actually figure out
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:59.620]   And it's a reef is a reprogramming of how anyone who's like used to you know working with video
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.460]   I mean we do video on a professional level
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.060]   So we've got that extra layer of complication when it comes to figuring out a service like snapchat
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:14.300]   But just general users you know recording video the thought if you have any sort of legacy kind of exposure to that is
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.500]   You're recording everything to keep it
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   You know and you're recording everything to make sure that 10 years from now
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.020]   You could still watch it or that is there when you want to refer back to it later
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.320]   Even though I've got hundreds of thousands of photos and videos and most of those I'm probably not going to look at ever again
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.860]   You know because I've got so many so I don't know if that makes sense either
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.280]   But yeah, that's the that's the thing with snapchat that I've struggled the most with is that there's actually two things
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.420]   I've struggled with his one is the temporary nature of it, which is you know
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.420]   I'm so used to leaving a digital
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.860]   Breadcrumb trail behind me, you know you can go back
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.160]   I can scroll through my Instagram feed for the past couple of years and see where I've gone what I've seen all that sort of stuff
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.880]   But the idea that stuff is gone and snapchat
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   I don't like because there's stuff I've seen that I wish I could have hold the hole on to
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.640]   Furthermore the lack of a feedback loop. I'm used to you know hitting the you know
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.480]   This the hard or the star whatever is the icon or the like button or whatever the the plus one
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.200]   Whatever the the kind of thing to give the creator
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.440]   Yes, I've seen this and I liked it
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.920]   But without other than chatting or sending something back to the other creator
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.540]   It's just like there's no feedback loop
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.920]   So I have a hard time with it, but but people say that's why it's so good so to each their own
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.560]   But it's it's definitely been fun to play with
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.560]   What about you Gina have you spent any time messing around with snapchat?
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:35.520]   Have you been lulled over pulled over into the dark side? I have I had a friend of mine who works at a college
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.680]   Give me like a snapchat lesson and it was extremely eye-opening
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.400]   Like and I just I felt like the way that my parents must have felt when I was like a kid and showing them how technology worked
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.960]   I literally was just like this is crazy and and just it's a whole different whole different culture
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:57.560]   I also just getting used to the you know the ephemeral nature of it although you can take a screenshot of someone's snaps
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.800]   But then they get notified that you do that. I heard I guess this is one of the sort of more advanced
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.320]   So I got into it for a little while
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.000]   But yeah, I think it's I think it's a really interesting app
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.200]   But also I feel like young folks keep the old folks out by making it sort of difficult
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   On your own
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.080]   Which good for them? You know that's cool everybody needs their their
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.920]   Their space or sandbox I suppose they keep outside on the door
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.160]   Yeah, that's pretty much what snapchat this snapchat nap icon is a key
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:37.320]   mega moroni on yesterday's techniques today really made a good point as far as snapchat is concerned and just involving kind of like
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.240]   Kids being open to the idea of this kind of ephemeral
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.840]   Disappears, you know that we leave no more bread karam chale
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.680]   And that's just because they've heard, you know the grownups talking about it talking about how you have to be safe on the internet
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:57.680]   And how you have to make sure that you don't share too much and this and that and that's that's their exposure to the internet
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.000]   From such a young age so it makes a little more sense
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.200]   I wish that I could reprogram my brain like that because I think that sometimes it's probably a good idea to not throw
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.600]   Everything out into the internet
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.680]   I'm just so used to it and maybe a part of that is just because it's part of what I do for a living
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.800]   That it's kind of ingrained and not only my personal life, but my career
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:21.520]   but I think there's value to kind of taking a step back and and opening yourself up to
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:29.800]   Kind of the goofiness of just recording something that's nothing more than a silly thing to watch one time and react to and move on
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:36.320]   And I have a hard time doing that it really makes you really makes you realize the kind of concepts that you just have just become ingrained
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.200]   Like I mean I'm old enough that I remember that the idea of the permalink, you know was just like
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.280]   revolutionary, you know that you publish something online you're gonna keep it at this link and it's always gonna be there and people can
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.960]   You know refer back to it
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.780]   You know was such a big deal and that's something I just always held on to that
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.640]   Of course you would have this item archived at a certain place where you could always get to it
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.480]   But I love how Snapchat kind of throws that on its head and I also think for us
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.200]   I mean we're broadcasters right but I think the majority of snapchat users are just messaging with their friends right like they're not
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.440]   necessarily performing or using stories or at least as far as I understand
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.400]   Yeah, all I know all I know is that I've been actively using it for about three or four months now
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.880]   And I've yet to receive any nudes, so I was told there would be nudes and there's
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:31.040]   Clearly could I can't find the button to unlock them. That's the problem. You just swipe diagonally from the top
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   That's the secret home
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.320]   I know a whole new world apparently
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:44.480]   So do we think I mean vine has as a service has kind of it had a lot of traction in the beginning and
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.280]   Because of its limitations, you know kind of mimics Twitter's idea of
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.360]   Keeping keeping things short keeping things refined to a smaller
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.920]   You know in that case a shorter video and
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.520]   Seeing just what would happen I remember when I first heard of about vine
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.440]   I thought it was the most ridiculous idea in the world six second videos
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.880]   Who's even gonna take the time to record six second videos?
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.080]   What can you even do with it? But a lot of people you know created an art form out of it
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:15.120]   But it really seems like vine over time over a short period of time has really kind of been left a little bit of the dust
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   anyways has it died on the vine
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:29.040]   Using vine to like tease their longer videos on Instagram or YouTube and so this change is just about vine wanted to capture those folks
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.920]   Right. I mean this is what that's about
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:36.280]   They just don't want people to tease and then say okay watch the full video at this other place. Yeah over there
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.000]   Well, I mean and I just generally I have a I mean
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.600]   We all know the the problems at Twitter and you know and over the past year as we've seen that drama unfold
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.200]   But I generally have a problem with the way Twitter has implemented things like vine and Periscope
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.520]   Into their own products as opposed to
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.840]   Folding them into the Twitter platform themselves
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.200]   I would believe that they would have a much, you know better
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.480]   Penetration of use and more activity and stuff like that if they were coming up my Twitter feed or if they were integrated somehow
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.200]   There was some way to make them, you know not so autonomous and make it kind of unified
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.280]   You know I remember a couple months ago having a car when Facebook rolled out Facebook live
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:21.360]   And we're having a conversation with some friends about how it's you know, it's probably gonna you know eat Periscope and Muircats lunch
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.760]   Because Facebook is so big it might have even been on all about Android
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:31.400]   I don't remember these conversations I've had but um, you know and and if if Twitter had just embraced Periscope and
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.640]   Made it a live video streaming function of Twitter from the get go
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.880]   I bet you it would have been that much more successful and then things like that happened today
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.000]   It down in DC with the with the sit-in
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.220]   In Congress being on Periscope more people would see stuff because Periscope is like this ghetto
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:54.120]   Periscope and vine I feel like these ghettoized little applications within Twitter that don't get a massive amount of use because they're not a primary focus
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.680]   And and you only really know to use them if you know that they even exist
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.840]   I mean Facebook does this with Instagram, right like Facebook owns Instagram Instagram is doing all right
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.120]   It was doing all right before Facebook came along and snapped it up
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:15.560]   But Instagram absolutely benefits from the sheer fact that there's that cross-play right like even if you're just on Facebook
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.720]   You still see the people that you follow their Instagram posts kind of come in and it says, you know post on Instagram
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.120]   a little bit of a little bit of a memory jog there
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.800]   Yeah, or even how Facebook is implemented Facebook live
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.240]   I mean I have a friend who likes to he gets off work and he grabs his guitar and he just does indie rock covers
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.160]   To anybody wants to watch and I open up Facebook and I see hey Russ is on live right now
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.040]   And I I've watched it more I've watched him on Facebook more than I've watched anybody on Periscope
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.000]   And I think I think it's because it's it's it's you know serving up that content where I am
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.800]   You know and and whether or not they're you know whether or not you know
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.680]   I know YouTube is is tinkering a bit with the streaming with the live streaming stuff
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.880]   But it's not a huge focus
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   But there's I think there's a lot to be said about
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:04.280]   Serving content to people to where they are and I feel like Twitter kind of cut their nose off despite their face with the with these two products
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.640]   Yeah, I also think it's interesting that that on on Facebook
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.560]   I felt there was a time when I think Facebook discouraged you from putting your Twitter feed onto Facebook
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:19.720]   Now I don't sense that because I think there's exactly what you just said Instagram is there anyway other things are there anyway
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.720]   What the hell this is your place for people to come together?
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.360]   And I think I think it's the Instagram ownership even changed some of the kind of ethnic of Facebook. Mm-hmm
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.480]   And yeah, you just jogged my memory. That's that's exactly how I used to use Facebook for the majority
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.800]   It would import my Twitter feed
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.360]   And I know this because you get those memories those look back memories of this day
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.080]   And it's like up to a certain point going backwards
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:47.200]   It's actual stuff and then before that it's like these short little blurbs that make absolutely no sense because I was putting it on on Twitter
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.920]   So I'm actually pretty happy they did that because it forced you to use the service a little bit differently
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:59.640]   Speaking of Facebook and their video kind of pursuits. It was a document that was sent to Wall Street Journal
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.840]   That shows about how much Facebook is paying for its live streaming efforts with Facebook Live
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.800]   We've heard plenty of times of the past that they're paying
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.120]   organizations paying celebrities that sort of stuff to stream using the service and
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.920]   It turns out at least based on these documents around 140 contracts
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.860]   totaling more than 50 million dollars, which I don't know if that seems like a lot or a little
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.560]   I mean to Facebook
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.080]   I realized that's like a penny if even a penny that's probably less than a penny to Facebook
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.840]   But but still they're they're willing to pay for this is there any reason why they shouldn't be doing this?
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.620]   well
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.440]   Yeah, I think that if you look at it as Facebook game content
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.600]   Got a problem with that problem with the California public but what not?
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.800]   But to me it
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.560]   this is and
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.080]   This is the this is taking the place of Brad revenue that they believe will come in when start my life
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.440]   And we were losing you a little bit there
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:07.360]   That's okay. We've got probably go off the other feed. We'll fire that up when we get there
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.440]   I went ahead and disconnected. This is this is something for a little bit later in the show
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   We can maybe talk about it next but
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:18.480]   Yeah, so I don't know Gina. Do you think I mean should Facebook be doing this? What do you think? I?
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.440]   Do you think that Facebook should be doing this should should should media companies be agreeing to this easy
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.360]   That I really really don't know about
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.840]   Because yeah, it feels I don't know whatever I guess I have this kind of sinister view of Facebook
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   It just feels like they lay in the trap
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.280]   And then you know and then what happens right
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.480]   Right, but then what happens? I mean like what's what's wrong with that?
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.000]   I mean like they clearly have money to burn and if content current
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.240]   I mean we we we as content creators often struggle with you know
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.600]   How to monetize our content and if this is an avenue for organizations like BuzzFeed or whomever else to
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.760]   Monetize their content. It seems like a win-win. I mean what would be what you know?
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.960]   I don't really I think I'm glad to see Facebook investing in this
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:13.600]   Their terms and go ahead. You go ahead Jeff. Right. All right. Yeah, it's
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.320]   What do you call me back guys? Okay, we're gonna call Jeff back. What were you gonna say Gina?
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:25.880]   So I was just saying like you know until they change their terms or change the rules or you know the kind of
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.280]   you know, it just it just feels like
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.800]   Whatever it's that icky feeling that I have about like just becoming dependent upon a platform for distribution
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.920]   But and all the platforms would love for you to become dependent on their platform. Obviously
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.320]   Exactly, and maybe it's not listen. Maybe it's not a bad thing
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   It just makes me feel a little worried well for but for the media companies not play Facebook
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.280]   Right, but we're not we're not hearing that we're not hearing the the e-word
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.960]   We're not hearing exclusive in this way
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:02.240]   I mean, maybe they're doing exclusive content for Facebook live, but they're not keeping BuzzFeed from doing stuff on snapchat or for what?
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   Obviously because they're active in those other platforms
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.520]   You know, I mean if I was a medium
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:14.160]   I mean, I'm I'm a content creator and if but if I was at a larger media company that Facebook was wooing and offering
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.720]   $3 million to commit to using the platform over the next two years that it's great
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:25.840]   Yeah, sure, you know like and and I think that we've got this we've got this weird and I get it
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   but we've got this weird feeling of
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:35.360]   You know trepidation or or or you're kind of you know kind of fearful of Google of Facebook of these big companies
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.600]   Of what they're doing, but I just see it as them investing in the in the ecosystem
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.960]   You know, they they want content
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.480]   So they need to support the people creating content to put on their platform and the circles got to keep going and will that money
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.280]   Always be there probably not I mean we saw the same thing with YouTube a couple years ago when YouTube got super
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.440]   You know hyper supportive of vloggers and and made YouTube stars and all stuff like that
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.480]   And that has evolved and changed over the years since that started happening like five years ago
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   So, you know, who knows what will be in 2017, but for now good BuzzFeed cash that check go go do stuff on Facebook
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   I think that's great
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.800]   Yeah, I think is if I'm back
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.960]   kind of
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   Is is if they favor the content they pay for over the content that they don't write then a company like Twitch
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:29.240]   Can't break in if they're favoring. Yeah, I don't know what make it up. See that. Yeah, that's the that's the issue
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   Put some in channel conflict. Yeah
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.960]   But I mean but that but that said that that's that's fair market, right? I mean, that's I mean that's that's them
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.320]   You know, it's it's frustrating for an upstart, you know video content created company to do that
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.800]   but then the argument could be made that that's the
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.960]   That's the motivation to make better content to increase your audience to get noticed so that this is just another level
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.120]   I mean, you know, just you know, you know, I know nowadays any you know, Jason
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.800]   We often talk about music a lot and all about Android
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:01.760]   But you know nowadays any band can get together and record a garage band and put mp3's up on bandcamp and now they're published
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:08.120]   But years ago there was a hierarchy and bands got signed by record labels because they did the work and they were you know
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:14.160]   And earned that spot and I think there's something to be said for having a discipline in your content creation and having
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.440]   levels to attain and
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.040]   You know putting money back into the content creators
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.800]   I think is a good thing in this in this period of ad blockers and you know all these other ways to
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:30.160]   reroute around revenue and and it's really hard to make content. We know we know this personally so I I
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:36.800]   Mean I mean, I would worry too about the prioritization, but at least they're putting money into the into the ecosystem
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.680]   Who knows maybe Facebook will pay all of us to do live video at some degree
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:48.320]   I would gladly three point zero five million dollars or does that just go to BuzzFeed the highest paid publisher on that list
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:54.240]   So I tried out I we tried out the new mevo camera at CUNY
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.440]   We had Sri Sri Navas in the social media weekend at CUNY last week
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.560]   So we did an episode of dot NYC using the mevo camera and the sound isn't there
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:07.440]   You actually don't have the software yet for the direct input. It was just the like but it's really impressive
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.200]   Producer sitting there with an iPhone able to click on faces move boxes around produce the entire show
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:21.320]   with with a $400 camera and an iPhone and you think about what people could do on Facebook live coming up
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   It's gonna be amazing
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   So I had not really looked into this camera a whole lot before
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.300]   I mean I'd heard about it. So this is basically the little kind of like tabletop you put it down
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:38.960]   Live event camera. Does it follow the action as as it's no no, it's a hundred fifty degree angle
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   So it's like getting a four camera shot and one
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.080]   So it's get mevo dot com. Yep and
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.960]   From live stream and it's and it's really sweet
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.520]   It's just amazing because all you do is in all it what it does do is it recognizes
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.960]   Faces I think you're right actually Jason
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.920]   I think that if you have a focus on my face and I move unlike what just happened
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.040]   I think that it would stick with me if you want that I think that it can do that
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:12.600]   No, re required math. This is the camera is not moving. It's just moving the vision within 150 degrees
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.960]   Right. It's got the full resolution and it can lock onto you. Yeah, there we go. Yes
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.560]   Is this an episode of dot and we see which is just like the latest episode of that and we see
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.500]   Yeah, we did we did kind of a test an experiment with
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.040]   Social media weekend. Yeah
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.280]   Nice and it's cool. Um now so I put it we put it on dot and Yc's
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.080]   Facebook stream which didn't get many users I get in the future. I probably should put it on my stream on Facebook
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:46.840]   And as if the sound is not perfect, but it's but it's it's impressive. Hmm. I like that
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   A lot being able to just smack it down there and all of these things that are that are making it less and less
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:59.280]   Required to have a jammer be standing behind the tricaster right now. Thank you so much. Somebody somebody go pat him on the back
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   Yes, exactly bring him a drink
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.680]   Okay, it's okay the robots are taking your job
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:14.640]   I feel like every single day. There's a robot is taking your job story. It's starting to get a little intimidating
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   We have a lot to talk about
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.920]   We also have
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.280]   Some sponsors, so we're gonna thank our sponsor here right now
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.840]   This episode of this week and Google is brought to you by texture

[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.640]   We can we go back to video for one second. Let's do it
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:27.400]   Fascinating story, so if you saw that that members of the of Congress held a sit down
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.080]   over over the lack of action on on gun control legislation and
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.920]   Because the cameras at C span uses are controlled by the government that is to say the majority they were turned off
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.560]   But C span went on
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.480]   Broadcasting because that legislators used periscope
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.440]   to
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   broadcast what was happening and
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:55.920]   So it went around the government cameras and around the I guess we should say government censorship of what was happening in our own
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.040]   House of Representatives. I just found that fascinating the periscope became a
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.080]   Revolutionary tool for our
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.240]   I think it was a combination it was a combination of periscope and Facebook live
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.000]   Because I think periscope kept on crashing for a lot of them
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.440]   So they moved over to Facebook live at one point so which is funny because it goes back to our previous point, but yeah
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.160]   I'm
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.400]   Fascinating that C span doesn't have someone in the building there. It's literally just like a security camera. That's triggered by the gavels
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.120]   So, you know
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.360]   So glad to see the folks in Washington figuring out how to actually get video out of an important moment like that
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.360]   So let's hope it has some results
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:35.320]   I guess that's the benefit of having multiple services though as if one doesn't work
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.320]   You can always fall back on to the next one
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.880]   The problem per periscope is if they then use Facebook live and hey, what do you know that worked actually really well?
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.360]   Goodbye Facebook live
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:53.600]   That's cool though. That's crap. That's awesome that they were that that those that were out on the floor actually cared enough to make that happen
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.000]   You know what I mean instead of just business as usual. That's really cool. Yeah, very cool
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.480]   I guess we can stay on Twitter because we really only have one other Twitter story in here
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.200]   And it's actually a pretty interesting one if we want to move over to kind of machine learning
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:13.720]   Twitter announced it bought AI startup magic pony which has an incredible awesome name that you say so myself
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.920]   No, some was disclosed on that CEO Jack Dorsey said this would help make
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.640]   Twitter the first and best place to see what's happening in the world
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.200]   Which is kind of okay, so it's it's AI but it's AI related to video from what I could gather
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:38.000]   Basically what they do what magic pony is known to do is things like upgrading low res video into better looking video
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.440]   Essentially another part of their technology is taking analyzing images
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:50.200]   so analyze analyzing a series of images about a certain area or place or whatever and then taking a single image that doesn't include all of that
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.960]   Information and taking what's in the other images and smashing it in so kind of filling in the blank so to speak
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:02.800]   Possibly creating kind of like taking a texture of an image that isn't evident in one
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.960]   place and
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.920]   I don't know lifting that from another one and kind of filling in the blanks
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:17.240]   Twitter is doing I guess more and more in AI this seems like it might actually translate somewhat into their video product
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.320]   I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out what the importance of this
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.520]   Acquisition is dude. Does anyone have any ideas here? I?
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   Don't know I
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:39.600]   Mean it seems like I mean there it seems like they could use this tech to kind of stitch together
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.800]   You know, I mean if you have a live event happening where a bunch of people are you know posting pictures of videos from one place
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.240]   Kind of using those to enhance one another that those that kind of the moments kind of application
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.800]   I don't know am I stretching here? I don't know that sounds pretty forward-thinking
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.080]   I
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   Think that's where the war is
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   If you look at the discussions we've had about
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.320]   Google Assistant that's going to be powered by AI
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.680]   Facebook's ability to show you what you want is fed power by AI
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   So yes the ability to predict what you want and change your feeds and change how it knows what content is what content?
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.520]   Sure on the other hand AI is just the magic fairy dust is being thrown on everything
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.680]   I don't know if you guys have seen the trunk video this week. Yes
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:29.160]   I
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:38.800]   Know the founders are rolling in their graves
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.640]   Renamed trunk and they put a video talking about how AI is just gonna solve everything they do
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.240]   here we go I put the video down at the bottom and
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:53.940]   Strange thing about this video is it's really hard to tell whether it's actually taking itself seriously or whether it's total parody
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.560]   It's just a strange strange deal
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.600]   Do we have audio and it also means pooling of resources?
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.440]   It's about meeting in the middle having a tech startup culture meet a
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:13.360]   Legacy corporate culture and then evolving and changing and that's really the fun part. That's exciting
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.680]   We have great titles. We produce tons of great content every single day
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:24.280]   We're really focused on how we deliver it to people in a way that they want to consume it more and more
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.980]   One of the key ways we're going to harness the power
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:32.340]   This video - but I watch this video is like okay, so this is this is just targeted at employees
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.120]   Okay, which the motivated boy is behind this wonderful
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:42.640]   Journalism feed it into a funnel and then optimize it so that we reach the biggest global audience possible
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:51.360]   The key to making our content really valuable to the broadest possible audience is to use machine learning to
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.800]   Maximize old go yeah
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:36:02.240]   Artificial intelligence is going to allow journalists to do their jobs more efficiently finding the right photos the videos the databases
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.360]   The things that you will package your stories with right now. That's a manual effort with artificial intelligence
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:14.800]   You can create a system that automatically is doing that for you almost instantaneously as you are writing as you're working on a story
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.760]   Ultimately those
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.640]   efficiencies will help us produce more content better content that will make stories
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.760]   Much more exciting much more visual and today that's what people expect so Jeff
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.280]   What is your takeaway on this?
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.960]   I mean other than the video and the kind of the production level of things which they have no strategy whatsoever
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.000]   They're trying to imagine that there's gonna take their content factory
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.640]   They're gonna find more ways to throw more crap at you and make more crap to then more throw more crap at you
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:48.440]   Now so I put this up on Twitter and I said be the first on your block to mock this and then an executive at another
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.920]   Major newspaper company scolded me and said well people should be trying new things
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.040]   They're not I said dare you to talk about the strategy is here
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.560]   Except throwing jargon at it and saying we're gonna have artificial intelligence make more stuff
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.960]   It's not a strategy. They're not a content factory, but that's a whole another discussion
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:12.520]   So it's been it's been completely roundly mocked everywhere. I think there's a parody version out already though. There must be rather redundant
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.880]   Anyway, so artificial intelligence becomes the secret sauce for everybody
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:23.520]   Oh, we'll just add some in and it'll do amazing things and and and that's what I worry about Twitter
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.680]   If Twitter is really just a feed of what you want
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:34.800]   Because artificial intelligence help that I don't know then again as I said, that's where the war is being fought with the other platforms
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   So it's kind of this recurring theme
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:44.880]   Everyone feels like they need to invest in artificial intelligence because everybody else is investing in artificial intelligence
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:52.960]   And but simply having AI as part of your as part of your I don't know your your your plate of food
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.280]   Is not necessarily enough. How do you actually put it to work? And how does it make sense for you?
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:04.400]   That's that and I think that's kind of part of why I was a little confused with this whole magic pony thing is like okay
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.080]   You know AI makes sense for a lot of company
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:14.120]   It makes a lot of sense for something like Facebook and you know Google and in kind of commerce companies search process
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:21.040]   Yeah, a lot lots of companies that make sense for it places that are gonna try to learn you better learn processes better make better recommendations to you
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.400]   Know where better to merchandise and where better to recommend things to you. Yeah
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.600]   The place where Twitter the problem that Twitter needs to solve is user acquisition
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   Right getting people you said if Twitter is a feed of all the things that you want
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.800]   There's a big step between signing up for Twitter and getting place where the feed is everything you want
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   Right so their big challenge for Twitter is is going from signing up new users and then giving them a great experience to begin with here
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:54.880]   This is something I would interest you so if this is about like making Kim Kardashian's fuzzy photos a little bit sharper
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.520]   And making that you know a thing. Oh, yeah, this is a thing on Twitter. I'm gonna follow this person
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   Then maybe that's worth it for them
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.640]   You know, I don't know but but yeah
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:08.240]   I mean I think that's where the AI comes in for them is stronger recommendations for when you first are on
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.200]   onboarding to convert lurkers or
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.920]   Deserters into regular Twitter users. I just to get to get them to come back
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.720]   I mean they might sign up and say okay
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.160]   What the big deal is then then walk away and never come back or never log back in again?
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.800]   I think that's the great point. Um, you know, I think that the I mean at this point
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.760]   It's either AI or VR. I mean, it's it's pick one that
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.040]   That's being invested in and and and and and in all probable realities
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:39.680]   It's both because I imagine a lot of the work that the AI is doing is gonna drive eventually
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   You know the CRISPR photos all stuff is gonna drive an eventual VR experience because that needs to be so high res and so much better
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.360]   And that sort of thing so
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.280]   But yeah, I what Twitter is up to and what they're doing
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.920]   I don't know they clearly need to be doing something to get out of the rut
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.040]   They're in and it looks like they're making small moves and pieces that we might not know what the end result is for a while
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:05.200]   But at least they're trying, you know, at least they're that they're seeing where there's new technology and grabbing it seeing how they can apply it to
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   I think that's interesting sure
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.120]   What do you say should we talk about Google a little bit because I guess this is this week
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:21.520]   Question there now that the great explainer is on the show. I want to explain the the two factor change
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:34.760]   Please do because I've been realizing in in quick order very recently
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.480]   How necessary it probably is for me to do this whole two factor thing and for some reason I hesitate
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.040]   I don't know if I fear it. I don't know what it is. I know it's safer
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.200]   But I know it's also more inconvenient with security comes inconvenience. I totally get it
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.840]   But does this that we're gonna talk about here this two factor change that Google made
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.680]   Is is this an improvement? Does this make it easier? What do you think Gina?
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.440]   Definitely definitely. I mean so the current state of two factor authentication
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:05.400]   Is that you have to copy a code that you know that when you try to log in somewhere
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   That you get an SMS with with a link or code or you have to use an authenticator app to get a code
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.360]   Which then you you know hand manually key in to say yes, this is me. This is my two factor code
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.520]   And so this change so I mean the problem with that is it's way inconvenient, right?
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.240]   It's really annoying and inconvenient and that's why folks like Jason don't turn it on
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:34.000]   This change is instead of having to like look at a code and scan a barcode whatever or get an SMS you you get a push notification
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.640]   With a button yes authenticate me or no, right?
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.560]   And so you just tap it so just makes the experience of authenticating with two factor
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:49.160]   Google now or something and you say hey somebody has tried to be you here is that you is that okay?
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.560]   And you just click the button yes, that's my understanding
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.920]   I haven't tried this new update, but that is my understanding
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.280]   I actually I actually got I got hit with this last week actually on one of my
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:06.000]   Personal domains that are that are running Google apps where I logged in on a new computer and then all of a sudden on my phone
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.080]   You know I have two-factor authentication turned on I've been using it for a very very long time
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.840]   I actually like the SMS, you know like I get a code
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.640]   I'm fine typing it in all that sort of stuff
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:21.160]   But I got this new experience without knowing what it was that I almost didn't believe it like I kind of had to do like a whoa
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.920]   What changed you know like I'm doing the Jurassic Park move as I'm looking at my computer
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.880]   But but it actually made it that much easier. It just it just said it said you know
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.840]   You're you have an attempted login on this computer on this IP address, you know allow and I said yes
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:39.040]   And then it just worked and so I was impressed by it. Yeah, yeah, so
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.960]   And now I mean
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   Get a rid of passwords as they've supposedly vowed they're gonna do
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.640]   God I'd love I'd love to see that I got I gotta say as some as somebody who now
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:57.040]   you know as Gina and Jason know and Jeff I'll fill you and I'm using the next bit Robin phone and
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.720]   It's got the it's got the thumbprint verification
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.240]   Which I'm a little I'm late to the game on this
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.720]   I know the Nexus 6p and other devices have had this for a while
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.520]   But it's my first device that I've been using on a daily basis with the thumbprint
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:14.240]   Recognition and I've been turning that on wherever I can so like logging into the Bank of America app
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.920]   I have a very long complicated password for my online banking
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.960]   And it's always been a pain in the butt with my fat fingers to type it in on the keyboard every time
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:26.560]   Now I just scan my fingerprint and I log into my bank stuff and it works like that to me
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:33.200]   Like that's the the greatest argument against passwords and if Google can figure out something whether it's thumbprint based or some other way to eliminate
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:40.560]   Passwords I would be the first to sign up for it because you know with with all the requirements with capital letters and lowercase letters and numbers and symbols
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.200]   And all this other stuff is getting out of hand for the right reason
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.240]   But it is also making it a larger obstacle to actually get to the data
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.160]   I want to get you on a daily basis. So yeah, I mean
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.680]   I mean passwords are the single biggest usability problem for everything
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:59.600]   I mean I every time I see my mom I have to reset her iTunes login. I'm every single time
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.680]   Because she's trying to download her nap and I change it last night
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.840]   Oh and I incremented it because you can't use the password that you I mean passwords are they're terrible
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:14.160]   And yeah, I hope that this is some indication that Google Google knows that you know what we need we need something better than passwords
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.200]   The thing about two factor off the SMS
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.440]   Method I think is really flawed
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:26.320]   I heard a friend of mine was saying that her her account got hacked because someone managed to call Verizon which was her her
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.880]   her carrier mobile carrier and
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:36.560]   Basically transfer her line to a different sim and then use two factor off got the message and like hacked her account that way by
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.480]   By basically hacking her mobile account, right?
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.360]   So like I mean look there's always gonna be places where things can get you know
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.800]   Where there are vulnerabilities and and the more thing about two factors that it sort of spreads like now
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:53.600]   There are more places vectors for for security attacks even though it is more secure
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.840]   So I mean
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.320]   This method and this is why I use Othy
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.800]   That the app or Google authenticator. I use Othy because it's a little bit nicer
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.280]   Why use that method versus the SMS method method?
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:11.360]   So I think this is just kind of another way you can implement this without tying it to your mobile carrier
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:16.280]   So basically if you take this to the extreme then anytime you try to sign into anything
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:22.240]   If it goes to the device that Google knows you have and you say okay, that will sign you in
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:30.040]   Yes, but you still have to use your password is still two factor you still had to use your password back at the original sign in
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.120]   It's just you didn't have to put the number in now
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.560]   Right exactly exactly right that's that's what two factor is is to prove that you've got this other
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:43.920]   Factor is the is the phone or the tablet or whatever the other device prove on the other device that you want that you know
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.640]   That you are you and so it used to be the SMS
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.360]   It used to be with this code that you get on the other device and now it's just a push notification where you can just tap the button and confirm
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.960]   I think I did something I should not have done you guys
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.840]   Like I'm gonna go ahead and do this two factor thing
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.840]   I
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:10.520]   The best things happen live though like what I finally did it and hit okay
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.440]   suddenly my
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:18.080]   My chromo s said I needed to reauthenticate right because like now I'm protected by by two factor
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:18.840]   I
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.840]   Click the button to do it. It powered off
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:25.640]   So then I powered it back on and now I'm stuck at the sign in waiting to receive the code
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.880]   Here's where I messed up
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.240]   Because the number I gave it was my Google voice number
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:36.960]   My Google voice number is on the other side of the authentication
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   Your Google voice number isn't your phone receiving Google voice number is not anymore
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.680]   What about the flip can you go to Google voice of the flip? Oh boy probably not
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   I'm happy this happened live because
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.080]   If anything I could I could at least tell tell you not to do that
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:10.720]   Let's see I just I just need to get the voice. That's all I need to do come on Google this one time
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.120]   Mess up and let me in
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.800]   Let's see here. It's a sign out sign back in. Yeah, so this is synced now
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.960]   Sign out sign back in it powered down. Yeah, no, it's gonna be the same issue. I'm not gonna be able to
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:36.800]   Why do I give it my Google voice number why because that's what I give everything is my Google voice number
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:43.440]   But that yeah, but I can't get the Google voice number code that was sent VSMS so then great explainer
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.000]   What are alternatives?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.880]   So wait, okay, let's okay, let's think this through you guys
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:48:00.280]   So the the only ways in which you could access your Google voice SMS messages isn't there isn't there in Gmail a
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.320]   Chat label is that still true?
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.440]   Your Google voice messages
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:13.160]   Well a lot of things have changed with Google voice, but I mean the problem is in any way that I would get
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.000]   Access to that. I'm gonna need to the two-factor to log in right and
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.840]   One are you logged in on your phone?
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.520]   No, it it said it needed to re-authenticate there as well
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:32.720]   It just went away
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:41.080]   It said it and then it went away hold on hold on hold on I know I can do this it won't okay because oh I think I got it
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.920]   I think I got it hold on hold on I hope this works
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:51.000]   You can you can vamp if you like I've got a pace this
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   I
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.840]   Have it the danger of two factor right here
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.760]   No, you know and part of it is my misunderstanding, but I can understand why I didn't see it
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.120]   For the print out of the ten codes sorry
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:11.280]   That's pretty much what I got was ten ten codes because I've requested them from everywhere
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.080]   Okay, so I'm gonna sign in again. I think I can do this do to do
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.240]   This is a cautionary tale entering my password
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:31.200]   Rinkle is definitely a wrinkle I use my Google voice number primarily
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.720]   But when you set up, you know when I set up my backup phone number
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:41.760]   I have to use my I use my like native phone number because you know my Google voice numbers attached my my Google account
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.320]   But I'm always so worried that I'm gonna forget that and just get myself locked
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:52.360]   But you're gonna resolve this Jason. We're gonna figure this out together. We're we're with you. Okay, so
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:59.560]   So the verification code that you are sent that is the thing that you paced over there, right? So I got that right
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.680]   Why why didn't you accept it? I don't know
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.120]   Yeah, it's weird. It's not accepting it when I put it in
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.240]   All right, I'll continue work. Well, actually I can't even move the show along. I can't even see our doc anymore
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.240]   Oh
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:23.800]   You guys it seemed like a good idea at the time let me try again
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.920]   Audio listeners like wow you suck
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.880]   Yeah, no, it's just not working
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:37.280]   Tell me this is something that Leo would do right and hold on when you when you
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:44.160]   Sign up for two factor. Yeah, the option to get 10 permanent codes that you can put in your wallet and use
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:48.480]   That's I said you ever need a code. I should have done that you didn't do that
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.480]   No, so you can't even get to your account dashboard now to do that though, right?
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:51:00.280]   It says try another way to sign in when I do that the only thing there is send a text message to you
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.080]   Because that's the only thing I have sent set up
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.280]   So so Jason you never got to the code that went to Google voice
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.840]   That's what you need you need to get the code that went to go voice is your voice
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:17.440]   Anywhere is there any device that that it forwarded to or might still be in the shade or wait a minute
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:17.760]   Wait a minute
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:23.360]   Do you have the Google voice app on your phone that but there's no way that Google voice app is updated to support you factor
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:36.480]   Hasn't been updated for years. I do have it on here, but I don't think I was signed in because oh
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.280]   Boy, it's not gonna work again. Yeah, it's gonna do the whole changes thing
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.320]   Is there a story you guys want to talk about how I figure this out?
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:53.080]   So so let me just tell you this two factor authentication is really effective
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:03.280]   Good humor keeping on this I don't have a choice
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:10.480]   Is the chat room have any recommendations have we gone to the chat room? Oh
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.680]   Just like I'm stuck I'm stuck
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.960]   I'm I
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   This is a good question. Does it have a can't a can't access phone or didn't receive the message question like when it's asking for the code
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.600]   When it's prompting you for a code is there any way out? No, it basically just says well
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:37.520]   I mean it gives me the option right here. Let me see if I can show it without revealing anything. I think I
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:42.440]   Mean it gives me so basically if you show well who maybe yeah, it doesn't matter
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:48.400]   So if you see there it basically says, you know try another way to sign in that's the only option I have
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:54.640]   But when I when I do it it's going to let's see here. I'm trying. Yeah, it's basically like phone. Do you want to
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.800]   Send a text it's X message. Oh my god Jason
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.480]   Yeah
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:10.500]   No, I don't know you guys. I think I might I think I might have to start over with a brand new email account
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:18.160]   Can't the can't be it no way
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:23.360]   Well, I'm going to log in as a guest on my Chromebook cuz I can bat-tots where are you?
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.360]   I know he'd probably be able to like totally
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   Yeah
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.680]   Why did I do that you guys you know
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:41.080]   It really should have been smart enough to realize that you had entered your Google voice number for that Google account
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.080]   And that you shouldn't have been allowed to do that
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:47.360]   Yeah, it's a recursion. Yeah, but yeah
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.240]   I mean it's right like it it sends to the thing that's behind the wall and
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:56.160]   In order for me to get to that thing that's behind the wall. I need the thing that it sent me
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.360]   So I don't know what to say on that. All right, so I'm using my
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.520]   The chat room what if you what if you used all three and put an all three number in?
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.080]   That doesn't work because you didn't I didn't install a thief
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:15.800]   Yeah, he would have needed to stand the QR code and get off the set up. I
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.320]   mean
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.280]   Yeah, well, I mean I have different a different gene
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.640]   I'm getting into the doc right now
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:32.880]   No, it was not my apps account is my
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:40.160]   Fun
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.320]   Fun this is a Russian nesting doll of
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:57.720]   Like I said, I'm happy it happened on the show because if anything it's a lesson to be learned for somebody else
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.720]   So there you go. That's what we do
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:08.480]   Honestly, Gina you painted such a beautiful picture of it. I was like well, this is easy then I'm gonna just go ahead and do it
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   Well, no
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.040]   Ex-factor authentication the truth is out there
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.840]   I like that
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   I'm googling. I'm sure that there probably is and I'm having I'm having I have a feeling that once I'm like out of
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.960]   The mode of the show mode I might be able to focus on it
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:37.360]   And I'm certain that somebody's watching in the chatroom or at some point that can email us and let us know go ahead and
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.240]   Email me. I don't know the best email to reach us
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:47.960]   But AA a tweet TV is the all about Android email and I'll get it that way for sure, but man man. I was so close
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:53.360]   It's one phone number off and so anyways
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:56:02.200]   Moving on what else should we talk about what else Google?
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.560]   Let's see here
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.520]   I've got the rundown now. Thankfully. I'm just in with a different account
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:17.040]   What about DMCA? Google's getting a lot of requests apparently DMCA take down requests
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:23.280]   The number quadrupled over the past two years and that's basically copyright holders just trying to wipe away
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.880]   You know the links to pirate sites from Google search all that kind of stuff
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.640]   And you know obviously DMCA is
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:37.960]   Essentially it provides safe harbor for internet services like Google artists in the music groups
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.760]   Want to amend US copyright law?
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:47.800]   To kind of change it because they say you know that it's that it's just kind of unfair. They're playing this game of whackable
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   Essentially, what do they want to do exactly?
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:55.280]   Yeah, that's it that's a great question. They want to change they want to change how it's worded
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.560]   I'm not sure that I was able to find exactly the change that they're looking for
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:05.080]   But yeah, they definitely want to change things so that they don't have to play whack-a-mole essentially
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:11.480]   Chasing things down Google has said that it handles around three three million pirate links
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.040]   every single day and
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:18.880]   That you know, they're getting notice the notice then take down approach
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:24.120]   Which is what is going on right now? They say is working extremely well. It's got an upward trend
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:28.480]   They say that's because it's scalable and you know artists and
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.480]   and the like
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.840]   Must like it because they're putting in a lot more requests and it's usable and everything but the rights holders are basically saying
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.080]   It's like bailing out the ocean
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:44.280]   Bailing out an ocean with a teaspoon, which is a great way to summarize it. I don't know is it broken
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.720]   What do you guys think? I mean a great example of this?
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:51.920]   I think I is some that I personally have dealt with is that so for you know years ago like five years ago, whatever for
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.360]   My comic book site I fanboy we we did use the new video shows
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:02.120]   We're on revision three and all that sort of stuff and we had a theme song and that theme song was done by an indie band that I knew
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.120]   People in the band and I have a written
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:09.360]   Approval to allow us to use the portion of the song as our theme song from them, you know
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.160]   I covered my bases back in 2007 and that's what I did
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:21.280]   Maybe about six months or so we started getting DMCA take down notices from YouTube that were filed by the distribution company that distributes
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   this band's record and
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:29.680]   They found our videos flagged them and YouTube took the videos down because we did we you know because we didn't have
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:35.640]   Approval to use the you know to use the song even though I do have approval to use the song, but of course there's no way to
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:40.040]   Challenge it you just have to deal with it or choose to not monetize the video
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.840]   Which and which I ended up doing because I'd rather the video up
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.480]   It's not a really a large monetization channel for me right now
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.800]   But that's a great example of it where they just have these there
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:53.040]   There's just organization after organization, which is scanning YouTube and filing these DMCA
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.960]   notes
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:00.520]   You know to anyone and everyone because everyone scrambling to make sure they're getting the money for the use of their own music
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.800]   Which I get but it's a mess. It's a total mess
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:13.680]   Yeah, I mean YouTube YouTube specifically that's like smack dab in the middle of their crosshairs artists just kind of feel YouTube
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:20.280]   Monetizes their music without fair compensation YouTube doesn't have a thing where they're and they've been doing this for at least a couple of years now
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:27.200]   I know where they're scanning everything this uploaded and you know matching it against the database and if it matches they can
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:34.600]   You know basically monetize that on license content. They say they paid out three billion dollars to date in doing that
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:41.480]   Which is a lot of money, but I don't know what that you know what that is compared to how however much much other
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:46.640]   Unlicensed music or licensed music is there and what I understand is there's all these pirate links are totally
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:53.040]   The I mean like go to YouTube and type in and you search for anything and you find people just uploading complete albums people are uploading complete
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   like it's just all up there and
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.760]   I and and it's just this is awful
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:03.360]   Whack-a-mole game like you said that is just I think I don't I don't know what the solution is and I don't know what the
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:09.600]   You know the the artists want to see YouTube to do because I feel as if YouTube is trying to do the right thing by
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:15.400]   Setting up tools to you know to allow you know content owners to to flag their con
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.760]   You know flat content that is that they don't have approval for and chase down the money and all stuff like that
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.120]   But I it's a problem that I feel like it's too big to solve at this point
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:30.800]   Yeah, I'm unclear on what the artists are are you know proposing? I mean you know Google saying that take down
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:36.720]   You know notice then takedown is working. I mean I get I get where you know Taylor Swift and Billy Joel are coming from like
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.680]   Hey, my stuff is being hosted on YouTube unfairly and it shouldn't be but yeah
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:47.640]   I mean the other option is that no one can upload anything until they've proven that it's fair right or that it's not you know
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.080]   Copyrighted which isn't which is insane I
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.960]   Mean yeah, they're really complaining in the letter about saying well well technology has made it possible to put you know
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.200]   All of history is in the all of music in your pocket. Well. Yeah, that's the reality you have to deal with now
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.200]   That's exactly where we are
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.680]   Jeff you're not making me feel any better in the back channels chat
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   I
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.080]   Just saw those
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.920]   Oh, yeah, oh we should definitely update the viewers and the listeners on this
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.360]   I think I'm screwed you guys
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:26.680]   You might be I think I might have totally screwed my personal account with this move
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.560]   so basically
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.560]   Google has a page and
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.760]   Jam would be I don't know if you have the link
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.360]   But I'll go ahead and paste it under the two factor thing there it is in the doc
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.040]   Has a page that the Warren's
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.760]   Against using Google voice to send verification codes
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:50.920]   Man, so if you use your Google voice to receive verification codes you can easily create a situation as I've demonstrated
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.320]   Where you've locked yourself out of your account for example if you're signed out of your Google voice app
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.440]   You might need a
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.000]   Get through this little laughing you might need a verification code to get back in
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.760]   however
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.600]   You won't be able to receive this verification code because it will be sent to your Google voice
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.400]   Which you can't access end of line end of paragraph
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:18.800]   In case you've done this this is what you should do. It's just like you won't be able to access it
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.640]   You'll never get a job at Google
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:28.840]   Before
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.240]   To know that you just entered your Google voice account to that email address
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:39.400]   It should have known like that's like not I'm mad at Google like that was user error that Google could have easily caught
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.600]   Well, I need to get a load of this look at the next the next link if I understand it correctly says that
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.240]   That using Google voice is it is a vulnerability to hackers because they can change both at once
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.240]   So all you need to do is hack yourself. Oh
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.720]   Okay, so that's all I need to do then as I need to become a hacker of myself
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.560]   Jason
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:06.760]   Com they have a they have an entry that says security notice to not use a Google voice number for two factor authentication
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.760]   These are all very useful articles. I certainly would have a different reason a different reason here
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   Keep going that's it's not because of the obvious. It's because of another reason
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.360]   Let's see here of the past. You know
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:23.760]   We've seen a large number of accounts being compromised on several of our clients all of them had two factor authentication
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.240]   How are they hacked simple first the attacker and I'm reading from off these comms post here?
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.520]   Obviously first the attacker compromises the user email. Should I be reading this out loud?
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.360]   Compromise mostly via phishing or by stealing the cookie?
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.160]   Okay, I didn't know that happened because Google uses the same cookie account for all of their products
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:47.320]   The attacker can also access a voice dot Google calm here the attacker can see any SMS messages sent to you in real time
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.520]   This means that occur can now easily reset your password
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.880]   And then use goop voice. Okay. I
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.760]   Don't know I think I'm scared a little scared now
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.880]   I don't know what to think about my future in this world if I can't get into my email address anymore
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.080]   I
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.680]   Know that sounds stupid, but my life is built upon that email address
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.360]   There has to be yeah, I know like it's not like you can just abandon it and move on
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.640]   I mean I can't imagine what's in that email account like you've got to be able to get back into that
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.640]   I don't know
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:27.440]   Reform Google account recovery form and just walk through that. There's it's a questionnaire
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.360]   See if there's any option for you there Jason. Let's see here
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:39.960]   Jason didn't we have didn't didn't we wasn't there a Google support number that we called on the air once and found somebody very nice
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:46.720]   Oh, that was the next yes, that was the account. Oh, yeah, I wonder if there's a Google support number
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720]   We can call them the air and get their help
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.360]   That sounds like a great plan. I don't have my nexus device
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.680]   I think that was that was isolated to nexus devices and I've got the one plus three right now
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:04.480]   Which is another another wrinkle because I don't have all my normal apps installed on this so getting into them is a challenge
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:13.320]   And to the user name the use just sign in oh boy. This is just crazy you guys. I can't believe I did that
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.080]   Yes, see this this seems based around
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.880]   Around forgetting your password
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.720]   More than anything
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:29.160]   See that article which I also sent that says how to do it with Google voice and it says use email forwarding oh
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.480]   Okay
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:39.280]   Email forwarding that's something I'm doing the help here and one of the options is I'm having other issues with two-step verification
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.000]   Which would definitely be what I'm having
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.400]   Factor off
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.800]   Title why
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:56.440]   From tomorrow Matt cuts his out jogging in Washington DC, and he's shortly into himself alone in Potomac
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.720]   DC now, yes
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:05.800]   And he's saying you're gonna never get a government job. We're not letting you in the Pentagon fell off that happening
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.720]   And then I also envision those five people somewhere in Google with a beer right now
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.360]   We've done this before who's just shortly their heads off say we got another one. Oh my goodness
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.360]   I think what okay, so by the way
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:23.360]   I followed through on what you were saying Gina and it took me to that that basically that support that support page for the entry that
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.840]   We already read on the show. Oh, that's what it takes you to
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:34.280]   I think what bothers me a little bit about this is many times when I install apps that are SMS apps
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:41.120]   It I end up having to manually put in my Google voice number because what it recognizes is the number from the SIM card
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.200]   And I'm wondering why that wasn't the why that didn't happen
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.520]   Why because that would be the safest way to
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.160]   To activate
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:58.000]   Two factor. I mean especially considering Google voice is spelled out as not being you know as being avoid this by all costs
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:07.080]   Auto detector phone number. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. I don't Jason. Yeah, you have like Leo. You have probably a hundred Android phone
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   I do is there another phone that operates not with the with the SIM card
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.920]   But instead of Wi-Fi that might have already received the SMS
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   Ooh, that's a good question. I wonder
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.840]   I don't know if any of that stuff is is isolated to just mobile networks though
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.760]   It would still it would still get the the authentication
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.680]   message voice through Wi-Fi
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.040]   On the sim Google voice operates through the internet, doesn't it?
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:42.920]   It does. Yeah, no, it does it. Yes, but you still got to log in you still got to log in
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:48.600]   Unless you have it's not it's not gonna be hanging out in your notification shade because it's auto logging you out, right?
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   Like auto
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.800]   Unless there is some sort of weird blip along the way. It's probably I mean that's that's a good thought
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.780]   And actually back in my office. I do have a device
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:05.260]   I don't know if it has the voice app installed on it though right now because it's like my demo device for here
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.280]   Anyways, I
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.460]   You know you can go ahead and write this down for the best of 2016
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:17.240]   Pretty sure every time I come on this show. I do something stupid. There you go
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:22.160]   Really appreciating your good humor about it
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.960]   God, I couldn't do this. You know you're not even pottery. You don't even have
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:34.220]   Pottery might actually know how to hack into my account. So I'll talk to him after the show. He's got he's got a God on his side
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:38.320]   So this could be a good thing could be a good relationship for all of us
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:44.060]   Boy, hey, why don't we thank a sponsor? I think it's time to take a break. I know I need a break
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:50.640]   Considering considering what has happened today. I'm still having a fantastic time
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.480]   It's so much fun doing a show with Jeff Gina and Ron all at the same time. So thank you for being
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.800]   Being here for this access to your personal account after this. Come on. You're having a great time
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:08.520]   This is going down man, this is oh, I'm not gonna stop thinking about this one for a while
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:14.680]   I believe that there's a way and if we're doing it if there is a show that someone that knows a way is watching
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.520]   Is gonna watch is probably this show. So let us know please let me know

[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:37.600]   Before you do that I actually I just put into the into the back channel doc
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.760]   Ivan I was scrolling through the gmail help forum and
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:48.160]   Somebody with your exact same problem locked out locked out on two step verification using Google voice number and this happened
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.160]   About a year ago and it looks as if like Gina said there's the account recovery form
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.440]   Where you can tell them what you did and then within three to five days someone will get back to you
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.400]   And they'll turn two step verification off and give you access back to your account
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.920]   Tell me what you did tell me what you did Jason
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.200]   So that at least at least that's this is an example of someone's had the same problem and got their account back
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.160]   So that's that's not the worst thing in the world there we go Ron
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.680]   You just made my day my day has been destroyed and then made in a matter of 20 minutes
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:25.040]   But if you want to go get your device and we can vamp I do no no need to vamp
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.240]   Let's see there's plenty of stories to talk about
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.200]   Jeff T what have you thought about?
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.120]   Android apps on Chrome you have it installed on your flip
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:41.400]   Okay, so so I have so happens that I have the Chromebook flip and it's the first device that's allowed to put Android
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:47.040]   Into Chrome so you're not gonna be surprised get ready for this Gina. You know what I'm gonna say I
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.280]   Couldn't do it with my apps account
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:13:02.160]   I used my my regular account
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.880]   But
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:12.000]   But was it there it's a little buggy because the weird thing is that it puts it puts the
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.520]   Play store in the app tray
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.360]   Sometimes when I click on it nothing happens. It's a little confused about where it is
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.560]   But once I get it operate once I once I open it up either through that or I go to the
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.880]   The search icon and click there and there it gives me the play store icon and there I open the play store
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.760]   So it'll work and then I put in you know anything
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.840]   Facebook Twitter
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.680]   And it installs the app and it goes in with all the other Chrome apps
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.840]   So you don't know which ones which until you open it up and it's in its own smaller window which you can then make large
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.000]   And it operates as a separate window. So I'm operating
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.960]   Twitter Facebook and and other things and the big news is we'll go to this one Jason gets back
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:59.640]   The big news is that I could operate Skype and you folks will remember that I tortured Leo for like a year and a half
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:05.520]   Jammer be in company trying to come up with all kinds of technical solutions to me trying to do Skype on a Chromebook
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:12.260]   Doesn't work. So I was using hangouts and then then there was an effort to collage apps onto a Chromebook
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.080]   It was absolutely awful would not work at all
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:19.320]   But Jason and I did indeed call each other though probably he can't get to it because it's you know
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:27.840]   That's the there's the empty Jason's Jason's been locked out of the office because two factor won't let him back in
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:34.980]   Well, it's it's that's really Jeff. That's really interesting because last yes
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:39.280]   So last night on all about Android Jason had a had a flip on hand and we were playing with it
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.760]   We were looking at it and the the conversation around
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.600]   Installing apps on a Chromebook
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:53.120]   Was similar, you know was basically the question I posed is that what app is there that I would need to use on a Chromebook as the Android app
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.120]   That I couldn't use on an equivalent
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   Browser or web-based experience and Skype is the answer so there you go, but the other things like I think Microsoft word
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.760]   Yep Microsoft word right is different
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.480]   plus
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.480]   Yeah, so it's I
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.760]   Because photo editing apps there's some other apps you simply get get on Chrome
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.840]   Yes, right and interestingly enough like we were talking about photos and so Jason went to go install Instagram
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.920]   And it is not compatible with your device to install
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:30.240]   Yeah, so and so so you know kind of you're gonna see apps that really utilize the rear-facing camera probably will it will
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.480]   Not have compatibility because the a Chromebook doesn't have a rear-facing camera
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.200]   So maybe that's one of the things that are flagging them
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:41.360]   Yeah, so it's gonna be interesting to see which ones are compatible and actually do work and which ones do get blocked
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.760]   The other interesting thing is that is that when I go to the chrome so I went to the chrome
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.760]   I mean sorry to the app store
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.400]   No, the current loop. I'm sorry the Google Play app store
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.160]   Elsewhere and said let me try to install an app on my flip as I can install it
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.920]   I any one of my phones. It says where do you want to install this app lists all the compatible phones?
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.280]   I can install it there. It doesn't list the flip
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.960]   so it doesn't see the flip as a
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.480]   Phone equivalent now, maybe that's just a bug. Maybe maybe it's something architectural
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.920]   But that was interesting to that I couldn't do that. I don't think it's life-changing
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.400]   For most people they're gonna say oh, I can finally to your point Ron
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.640]   No, I can finally do this one thing if for me it was Skype and that matters, but I obviously have other devices
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.640]   I'm on one right now the pixel see
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.240]   however
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:35.480]   What we said before I think is once once you know across all Chromebooks that you can get all or virtually all
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.680]   Android apps
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.720]   then
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:44.440]   That makes a different sales pitch for the device. Absolutely. The other issue of course is that
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:51.880]   Not every Chromebook will be able to do this the original pixel won't the new pixel will and there's a there's an extensive list of all of the brands and
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.040]   Devices that will be able to do this in time
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:02.320]   So it's gonna roll out over time. I'm on the dev channel on the flip which is which is you know risky moments
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.320]   but works I
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.400]   just fired up
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.080]   the
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.880]   Flip and logged into a different email address
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.160]   Because yeah, that it worked it didn't sink anything over
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.560]   I'm gonna have to go the long route in order to get back into this, but I have hope
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.360]   Because we got contacts at Google I certainly hope so
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.240]   But yeah, I can show this off a little bit and I'm gonna call me firing it up right now
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:37.480]   I still have to like install things. I don't I will try and get it fired up quick enough to to call you
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.880]   But right now like there it is the play store is basically just kind of like
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.840]   Logging in for the most part and I do remember last night. It took this it took a little bit of time
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:51.200]   In order to get in there and yeah, there you go. You've got the windowed kind of play store experience. I could go in here
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.200]   I don't know. What should I install?
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.760]   Twitter
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.020]   Boog
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.100]   Sure, we can do this. I hope you don't have to factor on Facebook to you
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:05.720]   Facebook I do have a pretty long long
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.560]   complicated password though that I can't remember so
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   That's a challenge
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.820]   Really weird to see the play store on a window
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.840]   I gotta tell you and I like a detached window that is weird
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.440]   Yeah, it adds like a little frame to the top of it and it's got the
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:28.640]   Maximize minimize close buttons and all it's it's it's it takes them getting used to that's for sure. Yeah, I know yeah
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.880]   That's wacky
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.280]   There you go full-screen play store. I feel better now
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.720]   Like oh, it's like a tablet. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, exactly like I think I
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:44.280]   Kind of missed what what some some of the points that you you guys were talking about obviously while I was out of the room
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:49.800]   But my thoughts on this kind of match what I thought when I saw it which is if I'm in the market for
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:55.880]   Let's say a tablet form factor going forward personally. I probably wouldn't buy a tablet
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:03.760]   I would buy a Chromebook with touch and which means if I want anywhere near like the resolution or screen that you get on normal
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.480]   Android tablets
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.320]   I probably have to pay a little bit more than a couple hundred dollars for a flip because this display is
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.640]   It's okay
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.680]   But that gives you more or less the tablet
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:21.880]   You know the things that you would use an Android tablet for as well as the productivity layout and then Chrome OS for
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:28.360]   You know a lot of the kind of day-to-day computing stuff that seems like the best the best case scenario for me
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.880]   I don't know if I don't know if Android apps on Chrome OS is a big deal for everyone
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.000]   But I certainly like it
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:40.480]   I like the option that it's there and of the apps that I've loaded on they seem to work pretty pretty darn well
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   I mean barring apps that require things like rear-facing cameras or apps that automatically
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:50.000]   Orientate to portrait, you know like Instagram
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.280]   Force you into that that land that a layout on the problem on my pixel C
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:03.240]   When I run for example Facebook if I go into certain groups in the system on being verticaled on horizontal
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.400]   Right
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:12.320]   Certain things on the United Airlines app same thing it insists on vertical. It's weird how it doesn't know that it's it's on this
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.720]   That's it. That's something that you can set in your app. You can you can say only this orientation
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.720]   Orientation yep
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.880]   So any explainers back
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:33.060]   But the developer gets the decide I guess is what we're saying now Jeff you you've definitely
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:36.560]   Spent more time with your pixel C than I have spent with the pixel C
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:43.880]   Between these two like are you do you find yourself pulled in one direction over the other what I travel now?
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.480]   I am carried by carried by my flip because I do we're gonna talk about this today
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:54.600]   I travel with the pixel C and it works pretty darn well. The problem is I can't do anything with a
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.320]   thumb drive
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.100]   Won't do external memory and so if I want to move a presentation off or doing that kind of stuff
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:10.160]   I've got an issue so I'm I the weird thing is I've been traveling with both the pixel C and the flip
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.340]   But not my big old Chromebook pixel
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:18.900]   And I hardly use the flip only there's certain things medium works really badly
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:24.980]   They just aren't doing enough QA on on the mobile app so it works better on
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:29.220]   Chrome Chrome OS
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.580]   Some a lot of Google Docs things are clumsy on
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:36.740]   Android that work well on Chrome so I can see I
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:42.180]   mean part of that's just fixing the way these apps work and making them better and if you're gonna produce something pickles pixels
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.740]   You think this through
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:47.980]   But but yeah, no pixel C. I've got to say I'm gravitated toward it
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:53.720]   It's working pretty darn well on it the other weird thing I have by the way is I use it for these many long flights. I'm on and
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.880]   I
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.840]   Watch shows and now my play
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:05.800]   Google play will suddenly decide that it's gonna crash on a show and I think it's probably something to do with
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.840]   Authentication
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.880]   And so I have to wait till I'm back online and then I play the show again
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.600]   And it's fine
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.200]   But it'll start yelling at me and then I you know the my nightmares
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:20.680]   I'm gonna be on a 12 hour flight and I can't I can't play any movies and I'll be going berserk and screaming go
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.560]   And everyone will hear it cuz everyone hears when Jeff screams
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:35.800]   So I've got okay, so I finally got into into Facebook took a little while because I don't actually know the password
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.560]   That's a good thing right it's a good thing
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:46.240]   The password managers. That's why I rely on password managers and not too factor
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.040]   Not yet. I bet you I will rely on two-factor once I figure it out
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:55.120]   Once I once I install it when I'm not doing a show probably so man
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.440]   So yeah, so I mean I think the challenge here then becomes
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.880]   Why or how do you decide one?
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.880]   Kind of offering versus another, you know Facebook Facebook has a pretty decent web
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.440]   Kind of web app
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.200]   Actually, some people would say that Facebook's web app is too cluttered
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.720]   And so if you use the mobile app the way you're seeing right now
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.120]   It actually streamlines things. It just gives you your feed gives you a few things on the side
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.520]   That's everything up in the bar. So
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:29.800]   So it gives you a choice I suppose could be a little confusing to you know
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.840]   Just the average person that happens to pick this up
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.160]   But I don't know how many Android apps the average person is gonna be installing on a Chromebook anyways
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.440]   so
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.440]   Yeah, it was cool though
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.600]   Do you have Skyporkina? No, oh, that's right. That's right. That was the other thing my apologies
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440]   for historic moment
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:24:04.640]   We're gonna head and install this yeah cuz we have this call going before the show was even even happening and
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:11.480]   It looks pretty good. I honestly I don't know what I expected but but it worked about as well as as
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.480]   Hotel Wi-Fi right it'll ruin it will ruin just call again, but that's fine
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.480]   Probably so yeah, it's installing installing already. I don't know
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:30.000]   I love my pixel one if that's what you would call this the very first generation of the pixel and bum that it's not going to get these Android apps
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.160]   Access to them because I mean I use this every single day here at work. So I
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:41.240]   Would love to be able to to do that. All right, so we might cut away for a second while I sign in
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:45.080]   Yeah, I mean no matter what I mean I this is this is like we said
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.680]   This is a moment in history moment in time the fact that you know
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.760]   It's bridging this gap because we've you know for how long we've been wondering
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:58.200]   The about the divide between Chrome OS and Android apps and this appears to be the solution and I think it's a it's a great moment
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:04.400]   And it gives it gives like Jeff said this is a added value to when you're shopping for your next device to consider
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:10.560]   You know, I'm absolutely considering it now, you know because it opens up a whole you know a whole whole store of apps that you can use
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:18.080]   I would buy the HP 13 rather than the ACEs flipbook. Yeah, yeah
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.520]   The Acer the Acer
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.480]   The Acer Chromebook is supposed to be pretty good as well to at the yeah, so
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:32.640]   The ACEs is a nice, you know for the price the ACEs is worth it is to 229 I think but it's slow
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:37.920]   There we go. Yep should be getting a call look at that
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   There we go there you go Skype in an app on a Chromebook. Yeah, there it is
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:59.200]   Jarvis's now yeah, there's nasty Jarvis
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.440]   It works we proved it
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.920]   Yeah, yeah, let's yeah, we proved that we could make this work at least
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.120]   Excellent stuff
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.400]   All right, and actually the the the steps if you happen to have a Chromebook flip
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.120]   It's not that difficult to opt in you just basically have to get on kind of like the
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.520]   the dev channel
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:34.840]   Essentially and reboot into it and then it becomes an option in settings to run Android apps on and once you trigger it
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:40.120]   Once you tag that on the play store magically appears in your tray and you're off and running so but Jason
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.280]   I the play store appeared in my tray under my apps account, and I don't think I could get it working. Oh
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.640]   I've already had my fit while you were gone, so I won't
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.280]   the apps divide
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.800]   All right
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:02.000]   Fair enough what else what else Android anything jump out at you guys there was oh the timeline for Nexus devices
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.520]   essentially the the
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:12.200]   Google is being upfront with how long its Nexus devices will in fact receive security updates again
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.020]   You know Google uses the Nexus devices as kind of an example for others who are creating devices
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:23.160]   that run Android and in in some ways this kind of mirrors that but from a
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.360]   an update standpoint, it's like a little bit of a rude shock this week my
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:32.840]   my my Moto 360 is not getting the next version of
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.560]   Android where oh
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.360]   How how how old is that is that is that it's it's kind of it's got to be coming up on two years now, right?
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:45.760]   Which isn't that long for a multi-hundred dollar device that you hardly use?
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.840]   Yes point. Well, yeah, I'm in the same I'm in the same boat. Jeff
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.680]   We were talking about this on all about Android is that the given this new you know
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:00.920]   The latest update in terms of these timelines my beloved Nexus 9 tablet will no longer receive Android OS updates after October
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.720]   And so yeah, so and and and also looking at that
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:12.840]   You know kind of timeline of the devices and when they no longer get the OS updates really points out that we're due for a new line of
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.960]   Nexus hardware to be announced soon
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.680]   Which I'm sure is gonna come in September or August or September right in time for the the holiday rush
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.520]   And so if you care to see what the next generation are but yeah
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:29.680]   I mean we're looking at the the the obsolescence lifespan of a Nexus devices two years at best at this point so
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.960]   Yeah, which is kind of what Google has has already said for the most part. I think it's 18
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:41.840]   What is it 18 months Android? No? Yeah, you're right two years from when it was available on the Play Store
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.880]   So when it was first made available and then security patches beyond or just in general a total of either three years
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.440]   Or 18 months from the last sale date
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:57.120]   So if it was a flop and it came out of the Play Store early you still get the full three years of
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.800]   security updates, so I just I just like that they're being upfront about it and I trust that Google is going to hold themselves to this
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.600]   and
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.760]   I think that's a good thing
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:14.360]   I think that's a good example for some of the other OEMs out there who are all so focused on creating whatever the next thing is that
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:19.160]   They just kind of lose interest in supporting their previous devices. That's a big bummer
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:24.160]   Let's see here what else
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.360]   Do we have we're kind of at the point to where we start kind of jumping through and and tackle a few of these quickly here
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.120]   Google is going to help you self-medicate basically
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:43.720]   Maybe self-medicate if you if you think you understand what Google is telling you to do Google will enable you
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:50.560]   With updates to the Google app to kind of get kind of symptom results on health searches
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.960]   So if you ask it what does a headache on one side of the head mean
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.920]   Google would surface related conditions associated with this
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.040]   I mean I feel like this is what people do already with WebMD
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:05.120]   But maybe maybe Google is in a position to you know create
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.520]   better
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.640]   Recommendations and not make you think you have cancer because you have a headache
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.760]   It's just gonna make it easier to increase your hypochondria and make it answer our gout
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:19.000]   So yeah, I've been thinking about this a lot lately because well first I have a small child to get sick a lot
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.800]   But also I have a family member who got like a somewhat upsetting
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:28.400]   Diagnosis for a thing that like I had never heard of so I started Googling and I just feel like the user experience around this
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.120]   Just about like finding out more about symptoms and diseases is so so bad
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.280]   I mean the first thing that I should see is like don't panic
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:41.280]   It's okay, and that's never that's never the first thing that you see that the message is always the exact opposite
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:46.800]   Like this could lead to death, but probably won't I mean, you know, that's generally the messaging so I
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:54.460]   Some measure of authority to come to rise beyond just the page rank
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:59.400]   Right, let me try let me try and I this is related somewhat related idea
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.960]   We try this idea out you see if this makes sense that I was writing a post about this
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:06.360]   So I was on Facebook the other day and somebody posted a picture of
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.900]   Justin Trudeau in a lip lock with another man politician
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:16.440]   And one could guess this is the kind of bold thing he would do to make a statement about Orlando
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:22.440]   And so I moused over the item thinking oh, it's weird. I hadn't heard of that yet
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:28.640]   Hmm, but and when you mouse over some on Facebook it pops up related things right on the screen
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:36.360]   Right the first screen that popped up was BuzzFeed saying people are passing a raw along a bogus picture of Trudeau kissing the next thing
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.360]   You can see with Snopes bogus
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:42.880]   And and so I saw that there was the beginnings there of the opportunity
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:49.000]   for Facebook and Google and Twitter to indeed surface authority and
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.440]   It goes those medicals right so we're not asking them to surface what's true
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:32:00.400]   But you it's easier to surface what's false and I think there were like three ways you could do this one is if something's been debunked
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.640]   then
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:07.720]   You know what the photo or the item then just surface it and say hello that's been debunked
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:13.440]   Second what was the other second before you post something to say
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:20.440]   You might want to see these other things about this same item and then the third is gee if that really happened
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.080]   There was another post I saw a couple days ago that said that
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.720]   On Sunday that Obama had decided an executive order banning assault weapons. I thought oh
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:32.600]   Then I my journalist mind said
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:38.400]   Why haven't I heard that all over and it's not on the Washington Post is not the New York Times down the Guardian
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:42.680]   Hmm, but I looked in the URL was suspicious and whoever killed it so
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:49.840]   There are ways then that I and the ways that we in media could help we could we could post and tag debunkings if
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:33:01.280]   you are the AMA or or a good medical service you could post and tag and be recognized as an incredible source that requires Google and Facebook and such to
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:07.880]   Recognize some sources as better than others, but they do it in Google News. They write they allow the New York Times to post things
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:11.920]   Why wouldn't you allow the you know Harvard Medical School?
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.520]   To do that and say if somebody searches on this this is what they should see first
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:21.760]   Yeah, absolutely. I mean if things get sticky right because then you're a sign
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:27.240]   I mean, you know then Google's becoming you know an editor. It's the algorithm whatever, but I think algorithmically, right?
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:32.200]   You'd I'm sure that certain sources are weighted higher certainly Wikipedia is weighted as a very reliable source
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.680]   And it's very high and search results. I mean that's what search results do
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.320]   Yeah, I would love to see that
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.560]   I mean certainly at when I whenever I search for her health stuff
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.640]   I think all right like web MD is not bad like I'll look at a page there or if I see you know government medical
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:46.320]   Organization I'm gonna read that but uh
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:52.960]   Yeah, the medical stuff is it's a problem and I have user experience is so bad still
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.560]   Yeah, I have noticed in my own, you know
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:59.600]   You know you try when you know you get sick and you do the whole thing you Google it and then you find out that it's horrible
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.560]   And you're dying and it turns out then you go to the doctor and you're not
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:08.440]   But I have noticed that there is you know kind of Google has an interface for
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.520]   Around medical search results in this you know if you type in any sort of thing
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:19.480]   It gets this kind of blue box and it's pulling in information from other sources and kind of you know organizing it by symptoms and by you know
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:24.040]   You know medicines that are used and you know treatment things and things like that
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:28.400]   So I've noticed they've been making little steps in this direction that have been interesting
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.760]   And so this is kind of more of a you know kind of you know as opposed to leaning on the web
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.360]   And these are the world to actually bring in that content and among the amongst themselves is interesting
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:44.120]   But yeah, I feel like they've already been trying to organize that because you're right you know the the the user experience is awful and trying to research this stuff
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:48.640]   Yeah, yeah, the knowledge graph stuff is good and I and I've seen that you know
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.840]   I think maybe what I'm thinking about is like you know
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:55.800]   He like maybe there needs to be a link or some some sort of interface of like are you experiencing this right now?
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.480]   Or did you just get this diagnosis like go here?
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.480]   I feel like the way that a lot of the information is presented and you know
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:06.160]   It's just very sort of dispassionate researcher base when most of the time you
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:11.440]   Or a family member or somebody's experiencing these problems and you're googling because you're worried and scared
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.520]   And you don't know what to do and you know
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.160]   I don't know if that's a Google thing or if that's just a way that we write about health stuff online
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:23.600]   But I feel like there are ways to make that experience like just way way better and more useful for people who are dealing with those symptoms or
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.840]   Getting that diagnosis. So what you're saying is that this kind of content requires a little better bedside manner on this
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.880]   On the screen, which is true. I think that's you know
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:38.400]   There's a there's definitely a way to keep it more clinical and more information based than not as soft or sympathetic
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.320]   And I don't know how you do that
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:46.120]   I don't know you know how you put someone at ease via text on a screen
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:51.720]   But I guess you know that's something to think about that they're probably not thinking about the human factor right right?
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:58.760]   Yeah, maybe that's too tall in order, but I think I think there are ways to write words that are more reassuring and can be resharing and
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:03.720]   Informative at the same time. I don't know. You know what I think about help with this. I think artificial intelligence might help with this
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:12.440]   Yeah, it will save us all
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:18.680]   Another change that Google is making not to search but to maps and this is actually pretty pretty cool
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:25.120]   If you travel a lot, let's say you go to Japan and you do a map search and you see all of these points on the map
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.440]   But you don't know what they actually are you see the names for them
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.120]   You don't read the language so it's very you know difficult to pick it apart
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.920]   You might see that it's a restaurant, but you don't know what kind of restaurant it is
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:40.640]   There's a new Google Maps feature. It's actually being developed and launched first in Japan
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:48.160]   It reveals icons for businesses and locations more than a thousand categories that'll basically help tourists who happen to be searching
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:52.160]   Around on the map to see kind of that nuance essentially
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:55.960]   So even if they don't know the language they're gonna know that this you know
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:02.480]   They they called out the example of this is a ramen noodle restaurant as opposed to just a place to eat or whatever
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:06.560]   I can see that as being really really useful. Yeah
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.280]   And that's that
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.680]   Some of these you just you know
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:15.760]   It is what it is it is what it does
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.840]   I know what your head Jason said is if Google smart enough to do that
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.680]   Why are they smart enough to stop me from signing in with
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:31.400]   Torn on it to be honest like that's that obviously to two factor works well, right?
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:39.040]   It works well in keeping someone out of the account
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:48.320]   Stupid I'm really angry that Google let you put in the Google voice number for the account that you were locking down
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.200]   That is that is the challenge that is the challenge. Yes
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.520]   Leasy programmers it's a simple boolean check is this the number for this
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:04.720]   Message people to the moon and we can't let Jason is to his email. We cannot let him get into his email
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.160]   Stop Jason
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.960]   Right yes, please protect me from myself because I obviously need your help
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:14.560]   Gina I know that you have
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:21.240]   You and I've talked to quite a bit in the past about the nano degree the Android nano degree from I think a little more than a year ago
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.920]   They announced it at Google I/O and then you were actually taking it apparently there's a new Android basics
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.160]   Nano degree. This is a again. It's a Udacity service
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:37.240]   Or series rather for people who have little to no programming experience to build simple Android apps
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:43.320]   Which sounds really cool, but where are you at with with your nano degree and do you recommend kind of going in this route?
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.000]   I've had a great great experience with the nano degree
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.520]   I'm doing and I've slowed down
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:53.400]   I mean one of the things about an an degree is that you go at your own pace and I got this new job and got kind of busy
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400]   And so I've slowed down in my progress
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:00.280]   But but I've had a great experience with it and I highly recommend all the Udacity stuff
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:05.320]   I've been really really impressed with how how good it is and I'm actually really glad to hear that they've got something
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:09.240]   That's a little more accessible to people who don't have a lot of programming experience
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.880]   The course that I'm taking is for you know exist, you know people who've already programmed in Java
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:19.200]   But if you're interested in building Android apps, you have no programming experience. I highly recommend the Udacity stuff
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.560]   I've been super impressed with it and I've really learned a lot
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:26.840]   And I need to get back to it because I had some really good momentum going and then and then life happened
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:33.760]   What's that like be be it by Spanish lessons? Yeah, yeah
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:38.480]   About these online courses is just is being really consistent about them
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.120]   But but they're but they're fantastic and it is a learn at your own pace
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.920]   So if you can carve out an extra hour or two, you know a couple times a week
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.840]   You really can make a lot of progress and learn a lot. So highly recommend
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.800]   At Google I/O they announced this course and and they see it as a sequence
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.800]   So it's a guy feeds the next and and and they need it
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:03.280]   They needed the funnel as we like to say to get people going in and I think Jane is right. They're very good
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.000]   Sun Jake is taking one in iOS and
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.760]   And
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.720]   It's a great way to get people whole new jobs and careers
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:19.200]   Yeah, especially because I there are a lot of people that you know myself included like I think about an app or whatever
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.640]   And I think oh how how difficult would it be to actually do this?
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.440]   I know nothing about you know coding
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:29.360]   So I'm just not going to take that next step but knowing that there's kind of an official route
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.720]   I mean this I suppose would be as official as it gets coming from you know a course created by Google
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.160]   That's targeted for someone who knows little than your certified. Yeah, so
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.760]   Jason I hear they're gonna offer one in tooth factor
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:53.520]   You know the thing and I want to say about the Udacity course is that the thing that surprised me about it is that it's extremely career focus
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:59.400]   It's like for people who want to change careers and do this thing like they part part of my course is a resume review
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.120]   Practice Android developer interview questions
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:08.920]   You know they review like that they you know they look through your resume like there's a career coaching involved
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:11.000]   Which I I didn't need so and it's optional
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.600]   But it's really set up to and there's ways to like get in touch with recruiter
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.880]   They have you know hookups with recruiters. I mean they're looking to turn you into you know
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.840]   I'm a brand new and and red developer and I'm gonna get a job as this
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:27.040]   So even if it's you know whether it's idle curiosity wanting to build an app on the side or if you really want to change your career
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.800]   I think that's very possible and then I think that's what I really like about
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.720]   I think there are lots of ways to learn how to code lots of really good ways
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:38.040]   That's why I liked what the Udacity stuff is because they have that partnership with Google and they've got that kind of career
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.680]   Career flow recruiter flow going on
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.880]   Few quick bits before we get to our last
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:49.440]   Sponsor and then do some tips and and picks and all that kind of stuff
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:57.280]   You might want to check your spam folder a folder because Amazon is doing some credits based on the Apple eBooks
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.760]   antitrust settlement
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:05.240]   Nice I got 19 bucks. I was this is this has been like this has been like
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:12.640]   Class-action suit of Palooza this this year like a like a month ago or so. I got like $30 in my uber account
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:18.960]   Then then there's this and then there's the then unfortunately. There's the ridiculous ticket master one, which is nonsense
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:23.160]   But yeah lots of class action suits were cashing in well
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:26.640]   Yeah, I was gonna say the ticket master one is the other one where if you paid
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:31.800]   You know it basically if you bought anything between what is it 1990 and 2013?
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.720]   You were paying fees that were seemed to be you know kind of shady shady processing fees
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:42.200]   Did you did you log into your ticket master account to see what you got or how much you had I had oh?
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.840]   Sorry go no after you just I logged in
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:49.440]   Right after they announced it, but they didn't have any supported shows
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:55.840]   So basically what they're what they're offering is they're offering you free tickets pairs of free tickets to upcoming shows
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.920]   And those at one point were to be determined and everyone just expected them to be horrible shows basically
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.440]   I and very very minimal discounts for for others. So you should definitely check it out
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.160]   I didn't get an email notice. I just happened to like log in and saw it and I was like whoa
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:13.360]   Oh, yeah, I thought that happened I saw people talking about it on Facebook
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:18.520]   And then I logged in I saw I just had page after page after page of two dollars and 25 cent vouchers
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.080]   Which I guess was the amount of the fee for years years of shows
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:26.400]   I guess that you know I bought through ticket master and then finally now the the list
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:32.120]   I think what I find annoying about this like so the Amazon one is great because like hey to me just here's
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.440]   $19.90 that you can go buy books with awesome great
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:41.200]   But for some reason to take a master one is these are you can only use those credits on this list of shows
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:44.080]   Which are none of those shows or shows I want to go to
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.920]   So it's basically a non thing
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:51.560]   They should just give me credit to buy more tickets with because that's what I would have done but yeah, so
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:56.580]   But who knows what the legal ramifications of that all that were but the at least the at least the Amazon
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:01.920]   At least the benefit from the Apple class action suit with Amazon is that we now I get 19 bucks to buy a book to read
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:08.660]   My vacation in July so I got $15 and what I really enjoyed the most is that like on my phone the Amazon app
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:11.160]   Like sent me this push notification that was like surprise
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:16.240]   Amazon's got a gift for you and I was like oh really okay, and then I tapped on and it was like just class
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:21.680]   Artran Wall Street with Apple it was all this legalese with a number and I was like, oh, okay, that's a surprise
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:26.740]   I mean it was indeed a surprise for me. I just loved that the copy editor for the push notification was like
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:38.480]   Boring long explanation about a class action lawsuit also you get like $14.92 like enjoy. Yeah, all right sure
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.840]   $14 to spend almost on anything on Amazon though. That's that's the right way to do it
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:48.960]   I completely agree with you're on yeah, I was like really really that's what okay, whatever
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:55.080]   Amazon was giving away apples money and ticket master was having to give away ticket ticket master. Yeah, that's that's the difference
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.920]   Yeah, there you go for Amazon. It's a feature for ticket master
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:06.280]   We can't give me away all of apples money. Yes. Yes. There we go
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:12.240]   Any last story ideas before we get to the break and then do picks anything you guys are dying to talk about
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:20.080]   Three good. Oh, what about the what about what about the KFC box that allows you to
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:25.480]   That's that's a good last story. I think that's that's the right one to go with that was a good pick
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.320]   I saw I saw that I was like wow Colonel Sanders is getting 21st century eyes
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.200]   Yeah, basically KFC has come up with a new takeout box
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:38.240]   That's called the five-in-one meal box and not only do you get a delicious fried chicken dinner
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:43.440]   But this is only available in in New Delhi and Mumbai India
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:49.760]   But the KFC box comes equipped with a USB port that allows you to charge your device as you're eating
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.480]   And that's actually a great photo of it if we can pull up the link on it, but you can see it
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.840]   It's this it's this it's this great
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.560]   Cardboard box with the USB hook up to it. It's awesome
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:13.000]   Batteries with every one of you meals seriously. Yeah, which is crazy like what I'm what I don't understand what I could
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.760]   Yeah, exactly
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:19.720]   I couldn't figure out in the article whether like is that battery rechargeable and then so that's like a
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:25.680]   An external battery that you can recharge and then recharge your phone with later. I couldn't find whether that is the case or not
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.040]   I'm assuming so but if not wow that is a big environmental waste
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.040]   What a box
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.320]   Image of a person like throwing a thing into the trash on the side of that water box. Yeah, you're right. You're right
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.560]   Just please
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.720]   There's a whole video that goes with it. Yeah
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.920]   Dang what yeah, well, they've got the
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:53.040]   Like oh no is this you
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:58.560]   Your cell phone runs out of batteries when you're at KFC all you need to do is
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.720]   Get this meal and there you go. It comes to the court
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.360]   And it comes with the court. Oh my god
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.480]   Just asked you out you have to get
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:11.840]   Oh, you got your message from Rohan
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:15.760]   You got your factor
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.120]   You got into your account that's better than me
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:22.160]   I like rethink what a video box can do
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:29.600]   It's very apple s branding rethink what your KFC box can do no one no one I'm convinced no one ever
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.640]   Rethought that a KFC box should charge their phone
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:35.920]   Thought that no one ever thought that
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.880]   For the marketing team no one ever thought what else can I do with this box?
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.040]   Apparently a fully charged KFC box
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:46.320]   Provided 17 charge over a half an hour before it burned through its battery and died
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.360]   So it's not a huge lift
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:55.520]   What's so now here's the other question though is that while it's charging that battery is it also keeping the food in the box warm?
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.600]   Oh man, you'd hope so
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.000]   You'd hope so
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.200]   And if not then they really need to retool it. Yes. They need to retool it and
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:12.480]   This story was like a christmas gift. This was just like here. Here's this wonderful bit of fried chicken charging your phone
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:17.840]   It was a perfect perfect way to wrap up this segment
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.880]   We're gonna thank our sponsor right now and then we're gonna come back
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:26.320]   We're gonna do some tips and picks and all that sort of stuff but before we get there
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.640]   Let's talk about your sleep. Are you sleeping? Okay? You look your eyes are a little baggy and look a little tired
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:38.160]   I think you need a new mattress and that's what Casper can provide for you a good night quality sleep

[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:23.520]   We have two Casper mattresses out of the three beds that we own and we are working on
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.920]   Buying a third mattress for the third bed because our
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:35.120]   Our daughter never wants to sleep in her bed because it's not as comfortable as the other two beds true story
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.880]   So we're gonna get her a mattress and then we can all sleep in our own beds again

[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:55.680]   Uh, so I highly recommend it they ship it to you in this box that basically, you know
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:00.240]   I was able to kind of pull the box upstairs the mattress itself is a little heavy when it's out of the box
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:05.280]   But when it's in the box, it's easy to move around find the right place open it up drop it down and you're sleeping
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.200]   You might fall asleep right then and there so be careful you'll be like unwrapping it and then you'll be like
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.840]   And then you'll fall asleep. That's how comfortable it is try sleeping on a mat uh, Casper mattress

[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.200]   That's what we did with the mattress that we're gonna be replacing by the way
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:41.920]   Uh, and did you know statistically lying on a bed in a showroom has no correlation to whether it's actually the right bed for you

[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:50.000]   Who should we start with how about we start with the new guy? We'll start with you ron. What do you got?
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.560]   Consider I didn't know I had to
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.080]   I think we get it over with
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:56.080]   Yeah, we let you off the hook
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:01.440]   But yeah, so consider considering that one of my uh personal gtd heroes jina is on the show in honor of that
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.440]   I thought I'd share a neat little uh
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:07.680]   Productivity uh chrome extension that I use on a daily basis and you guys have probably heard about it
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:13.280]   It is one of those things where I don't know, you know, I never know how ubiquitous these extensions are I figure it was uh
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:15.440]   Better, you know better safe to bring it up than not
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:20.960]   Uh, but I've installed the momentum chrome extension and what this is is that basically this uh
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:24.080]   Installs on chrome and every time I open a new tab
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:30.080]   Instead of getting the default chrome tabs or whatnot. I get uh the momentum screen which uh
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.200]   Very, you know prominently displays the time
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.520]   Uh, it greets me. It says good afternoon ron and then at the beginning of the day it asks me
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:39.360]   What is your main focus for today?
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.840]   So if you know if i'm working on a project or i've got a deliverable that i've do whatever I can just say hey
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:48.560]   I'm doing this so and what happens is is that every time I open a tab
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:52.960]   After i've entered in my main focus as opposed to seeing a list of links or
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:58.240]   Chrome apps or things like that I get the momentum page and it reminds me that I really should be working on that document
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:03.040]   So it's a great way to keep you from having your mind wander keep you on task. Uh, keep you focused
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:07.040]   Um, it's also got in integrations with um, it's got weather integration
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:12.000]   So it shows me that it's currently 58 degrees in san francisco. Um, it does have support for a small to do list
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.600]   Um, so if I wanted to add more to do so than my main focus I could
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:21.840]   Um, but basically it's just a a neat little extension that keeps you on task as well as give you very pretty pictures and
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:27.440]   Uh, make you aware what time it is, uh, because we all know we need to stay focused on what we're working on so momentum
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.480]   Uh, it's free in the in the uh chrome store
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:34.320]   Uh, it's a small install and it's the one side installed that I can't live without it
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:39.520]   So every machine every every uh, my laptop my desktop every computer I have I always make sure it's on on chrome. So
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.480]   There it is momentum
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:44.480]   Chrome extension excellent pick
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:49.840]   Uh, especially because you're told to come up with a pick right before the show began so you did a good job
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:50.160]   Ross
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:54.800]   Scream pull what happened was is that I went to open a new tab to go look for something and momentum open
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:59.040]   I'm like, oh, hey there you go. See it was meant to be it was meant to be
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.480]   That's proof positive right there. Uh, let's see here gina. What about you?
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:10.240]   So my thing this week is a little bit self-indulgent. I hope I hope you'll hear me
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:16.800]   Uh, it's a new app by twitter called twitter engage which does something near and dear to my heart
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:23.360]   Which is give you insights about your activity on twitter wait a minute. This sounds familiar
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.920]   Yes, yes, it is
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:32.400]   It's iOS only and and yeah that verge review is like engage is a place for twitter celebrities to you know
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:36.080]   To interact with their followers. It's not just for celebrities. It works for everyone
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.080]   But it is like I said ios only
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:44.160]   Um, and i'll tell you things like did you get followed followed by a verified user or user or who your biggest
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:50.000]   Fans are who your you know followers what your followers have been talking about the most in the past 24 hours
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:56.640]   Uh kind of live analytics of retweets and likes if you tweet you can kind of see these like cool live bar charts change
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:03.600]   You know as activity happens on your tweets and uh, yeah, so i'm i'm recommending this app because
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:09.360]   Pour one outs. We are we just announced we're in the process of shutting down think up
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.040]   Uh, so this is a really good alternative to to think up
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:19.760]   We are we're funding all our subscribers subscribers and we're made that's this very difficult decision for a variety of reasons
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.000]   Which you can read about um on uh, we wrote a post that you can just go to twitter
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.240]   Slash think up if you if you if you care and you want to learn more you can find out more there
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:34.320]   Um, but I really like this engage app and I was also I was happy to hear that in the early product
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:37.360]   Discussions at twitter. They were actually looking at think up
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:44.480]   Uh, and it's a learn form some of their design decisions which take up. Yeah, exactly. They they should have looked a little closer
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:49.120]   Indeed
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:51.920]   But you know since years form
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.520]   You got any nice pendants hanging around
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.520]   Uh, unfortunately no
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:04.320]   But you know engage I think is going to be really good because you know, they're not they're not dealing with api limitations
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.840]   This is a twitter app
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:09.520]   Um, and api limitations is one of the reasons why I think up didn't didn't make it is it?
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:15.600]   Is it just became really difficult to get to do things and to show insights in the app because we just didn't have access to the data
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:19.840]   That's that's the real that's the real challenge. I mean, you know, gee and I had lunch last week in New York
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.840]   Which was delightful and always good to see you in person
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:27.760]   Um, but one of the things we talked about was the the challenge of building an application that's dependent on
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:34.880]   Other applications and when they make changes you've got to make changes and it can get overwhelming and and it's a it's a real challenge to make
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.240]   That a success and I think you should be immensely proud of what what you guys did
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:42.080]   With think up and it was one of my favorite applications. So it's definitely, you know, so
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:48.720]   Definitely you added added good to the world. So I really appreciate that and I really appreciate all the support from everyone at twit
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:54.960]   And everyone who listens to watch us twit and endured all my think up promotions week after week. I really do appreciate it
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:01.440]   So, but this engage app is really cool. And if you if you are looking for those kinds of insights, it looks it looks promising
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:05.760]   Mashed potato and chat room has a really good point. Think up you should have bought twitter
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:10.720]   Why did I think of that?
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:12.720]   Totally done that
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.840]   Oh, I love I love think up. I've been I've been a happy
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:18.000]   subscriber
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.960]   For the last couple of years as it has been around and I've enjoyed getting those notices
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:28.720]   In the morning about the previous day and kind of take a look at all the information that I wouldn't know otherwise
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:34.240]   So, uh, really really applaud all the work that you guys did with think up and I'm bummed to see it go away
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:37.120]   You did a great job. Thank you
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.760]   Jeff, what is your number of the week?
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:44.720]   So this this is one of those stories that I think it will lead to a wonderful topsy tervy silicon value moment
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:53.680]   So the uh, what's it called fiber to the home council of which google is a member released a study saying that having google fiber could raise rents by 11
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:57.680]   So here's what I bet is wow
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:03.120]   Uh, that they're saying that is a good thing in other words that your property is worth more you should want google fiber
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:05.440]   But you know darn what's gonna happen in in
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.600]   insane
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.360]   Real estate market san francisco
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:14.720]   There'll probably be demonstrations and egg throwing in sistine. How dare you install google fiber in our neighborhood?
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:17.280]   We'll see
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:20.000]   And it's fascinating stuff
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.360]   Um, I want google fiber. It's rolling out to all these different places. It never comes up to petaloma
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.600]   I'm just kind of bummed about that one of these days petaloma will be on its road map
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.640]   Uh sure keeps getting the map
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.280]   Yes, let me say that out loud
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:39.840]   If there's two things I want google to walk away from this show with it's one
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:43.520]   Petaloma for google fiber and two
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:50.720]   Uh, you should really rethink the two factor thing with google voice. I don't think you got the priority mixed up on those Jason
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:57.280]   I hope you really get back in your account before you get google fighter fiber. Let's just say that
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:59.360]   Yeah
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:04.640]   I'm not sure my pick my thing could be anything other than that cautionary tale that you had earlier today
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:08.560]   If you're thinking about doing two factor authentication as I was
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:14.320]   Take the time to think about the implications of using your google voice account with it and don't do it
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:23.120]   Well, I think that I think the large lesson here is that if you're whenever you're doing anything that involves security and two factor authentication or anything with passwords
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:30.880]   Password like whether it's awfully or or last pass or whatever after you're using do it slowly and do it in an environment where you have no other
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:35.760]   Distractions or I don't know not host a podcast while you're doing it. That might be big
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:41.440]   Like I said ron, it actually seemed like a good idea at the time
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:48.640]   Jason this is a tribute attribute to you and I mean this because obviously if you've been doing it in the quiet
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:51.760]   Of a room you would have thought this through we would have been it, but you instead you got okay
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:54.400]   I gotta break jar versus yeah, we're gonna know i'll do it right now
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.920]   And you did it and I think I think the
[01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:59.920]   You did it
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:06.640]   Uh-oh what have I done and and so I appreciate we all appreciate your sacrifice for the show
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:10.320]   Anytime but never again
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:16.960]   Happy to do it, but that's the last time I ever break my email on this show
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:20.320]   Uh until the next time that I do it unintentionally that is
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:26.160]   Uh that that's it for this week got to say bye to some folks that I just really have enjoyed
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:33.840]   Other than certain circumstances out of outside of their control really enjoyed the last couple of hours hanging out with starting with

[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:29.920]   The problem is is when something like this happens like if you got important stuff coming to your inbox
