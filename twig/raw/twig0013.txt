[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.240]   It's time for this week in Google, Twig, we call it,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.880]   with the Twig crew, starting with Gina Trapani of smarterware.org.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.960]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.640]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.240]   How's it going?
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.200]   Going great.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.960]   I hear you were recognized in Disneyland.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.560]   Yes, a Twig viewer recognized me.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.960]   In Disneyland, which was the first time ever
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840]   that I've been recognized anywhere.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.040]   So that was exciting.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.440]   Where were you, Wendy?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.800]   Gina, did that viewer wave at you?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800]   Ah.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.600]   He did not.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.080]   He did not.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.000]   He just said, hey, aren't you Gina from Twig?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.240]   And he was really cool about it.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.560]   And I was kind of like, who me?
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.160]   What?
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.920]   And then we should can.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920]   In fact, I think if I remember correctly, his name
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.360]   was Dean, so hi, Dean.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480]   And I thanked him for making me feel like a rock star.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.040]   That's so neat.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.320]   Here also is a rock star, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.820]   Leo.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.420]   Two of the top blogs in the world with Buzz Machine
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.360]   and Smarterware.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.960]   And ironically, as you were observing,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.520]   you don't get indexed by Google News,
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.200]   because you're a single author blog.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.040]   I've even complained about that to the Google News team,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.360]   and we don't get anywhere with that.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.160]   So is John Battelle even, and he's gotten nowhere.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.960]   I guess they have to draw the line somewhere.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.200]   But why is that the line?
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.640]   Right.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.040]   What would you suggest?
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.480]   I mean, who would decide that?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.520]   People suggest, in Twitter, that I should--
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.040]   it's like trying to go in the diamond lane, the plup doll.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.440]   Makeups authors.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.320]   You need an inflatable author.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.760]   Yes.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.800]   Very simple.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.080]   Very simple.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.360]   That laugh is the great Danny Sullivan who's joining us
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.760]   from SearchEngineland.com.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.720]   Hi, Danny.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.440]   Hi.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.760]   Danny's been an observer of the Search Engine scene,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.800]   not just Google, but going all the way back to '96
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.880]   with Lycos and Altavistan.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.400]   Who?
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.160]   Yes.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.960]   And really, a student observer.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.080]   In fact, one of the things that spurred me to get you on today
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.000]   is to talk a little bit about this new social search, Google
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.920]   social search that-- well, not just Google.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.440]   Bing's doing it, too.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   And you have a great article on that.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.280]   We'll talk about that in a bit.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.320]   But before we get to that, I left something out last week,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.160]   and I really would like to talk about it this week,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.880]   especially with the new announcement of Duroid.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.840]   Android 2.0, Verizon took a big shot at Apple with its--
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.360]   what is it now?
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.960]   Get Duroid.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.000]   What is the website?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.040]   Duroid.com.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   Duroid.com.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   It doesn't load on a iPhone.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.760]   It doesn't?
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.080]   There's one more tagline.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.880]   This ad doesn't.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.040]   So if you go to Duroid.com, which actually redirects
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.560]   to a Verizon Wireless site, you'll see all the things
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.880]   that the iPhone does not do that the Duroid does.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.720]   Duroid is a new Motorola phone that is running Android 2.0.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.480]   So what do you think, Gene?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.960]   I mean, have you seen 2.0?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.600]   I've only seen screenshots.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.760]   Boygenusreport.com has been doing some fantastic coverage
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.200]   of Android 2.0.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.400]   And what to say?
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.520]   I mean, it looked really cool.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.600]   There's Microsoft Exchange support.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.920]   There's Facebook friend integration
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.680]   into your contacts, which seems really cool.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.840]   There seems to be-- oh, there's a car-specific home screen.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.200]   So if you have the phone with you while you're driving,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.080]   you get the kind of apps and maps and interface
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.680]   that you would need if you needed directions
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   or need to look up businesses on your way.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.800]   There's a unified email inbox, which I'm not really sure
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.600]   what they mean by that.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.720]   But definitely--
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   Well, you know, it would be nice that the iPhone doesn't do
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.480]   is put all of my mail into one inbox.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.440]   I have to go to my Google box and then to my Yahoo box
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.080]   and then to my other boxes.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.000]   And a unified inbox would be great.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.520]   It would be.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.200]   And if they could do things like even kind of interspersed
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.920]   your SMS messages in all the different ways,
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.880]   the messages that we get into one kind of flow,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.000]   that would be awesome.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.880]   But it looked really cool.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.720]   I definitely suggest Android fans to check out that Boygenus
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.760]   report screen shot tour, which we have in the show notes.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.160]   Continuing in the line of pastries, this is a claire.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   Cupcake was the last one, don't note.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.960]   OK, now I claire.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.480]   But let's just say that commercial is scary and weird.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   Really?
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.440]   It's very aggressive because it's essentially
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.880]   saying all the things that the iPhone doesn't do.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.920]   It really is underscoring things like closed development.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.880]   And it says, "Droid does."
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.520]   And I think it's effective.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.520]   I think it's very smart.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.240]   It's surprising, given that Verizon
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.720]   thought they were going to get the iPhone.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   At least I thought that's what they thought they thought
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.800]   we're going to get.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.980]   I really like the first part of the commercial, the I Don't
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.800]   Parts.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.840]   And we talked about the best way for--
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.720]   You don't like the seven style graphics.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.560]   I don't like the transition.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.120]   It's like, oh, you know.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.080]   It's scary.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.960]   Show me something better.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.360]   It went from the happy Apple song with the reflection
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.960]   and all that.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.760]   But then it kind of transitions into this like--
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760]   Scary.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   Scary.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.080]   I don't want my phone to kill me.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.760]   I talked to someone whose dad works for Verizon, who
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   has held the phone, has shown the phone to others,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.200]   take it with a grain of salt.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   This has come from Verizon.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.560]   But his dad said, this is the iPhone killer.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.840]   This is an amazing phone.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.920]   Five megapixel camera.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.720]   It's got a real keyboard that slides out,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.120]   but not much thicker than an iPhone.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.120]   Looks like a screen the same size as the iPhone.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   I presume it's a capacitance touch screen.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.520]   Yeah, it seems to be getting really great earlier reviews.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   My only problem is, I mean, I'm a fan.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.880]   I love Android, and I can't keep all the carriers and models
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.520]   and makers straight.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.120]   Welcome to the world of cell phones.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   It's a nice--
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.400]   That's that Android club, dammit.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.440]   Let's start it.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.760]   Well, I'm buying this one.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.240]   So I'll hand off my last Android phone.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.120]   But I am definitely going to get in line for this one.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.760]   This looks like it.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.240]   It's going to be a spectacular phone.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.320]   When does it come out?
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.080]   No one knows.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.520]   Although, if you look at that strange, weird graphic
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.160]   at the end there, it has a binary calendar
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.800]   at the bottom, which some have interpreted to be,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.120]   I think October 31, is that right, Gina?
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.600]   It's this month.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.760]   I thought it was November 9, but you
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.000]   were probably right soon.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.600]   Soon, yeah.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.680]   Soon.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.640]   And well, I don't read binary, so it might not.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.440]   I didn't know about the binary calendar, though.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.640]   Yeah, well, if you look at the bottom,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.560]   that's what that looks like.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.280]   You're probably too scared.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.880]   They are Google.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.800]   I was hiding from my life.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.880]   You're terrified.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.960]   I can't look at that.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.920]   Whoa.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.800]   Here's the real question.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.360]   I mean, you can put all that hardware together.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.480]   You could put a great operating system.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.040]   It does sound like 2.0 is cool.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.400]   Doesn't it come down, though, to the application store?
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.320]   At least if you're going to compete against an iPhone.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.160]   This is a good question.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.960]   Yeah, I mean, I think the apps have a lot to do with it.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.400]   And I think if you're talking about the iPhone,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.520]   music and video is also a really big part of it.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.240]   The iPhone iTunes integration is really good.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.600]   I mean, I got an iPod Touch because it was just like,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.840]   I was so set up in iTunes that I was talking to make transition.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.960]   Microsoft phone will never, ever make sense to a human being.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.360]   Right.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.960]   Well, we know that.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.460]   Right.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:03.960]   It's possible.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.560]   No matter how many good apps you could put on Microsoft OS,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.520]   it will not.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.280]   I can't find them.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.200]   I can't get to them.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.600]   I have two or three Microsoft OS phones,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.960]   and they're dreadful.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.760]   Here's the binary clock.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.640]   I'll just zoom in on this.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.200]   Can you read binary or is that Klingon?
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Uh--
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   Ah.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.400]   I don't know what that is.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.960]   I like that if you go down below that,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.200]   they actually have a disclaimer telling you
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.120]   that Troy is a trademark of Lucas Films.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.360]   Of Lucas Films, yeah.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.600]   That's going to be a problem.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.960]   I mean, Troy is kind of generic,
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.040]   but something's going on there where they decided,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.840]   but we better make sure we don't get anybody from Lucas
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.880]   Films after us.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.360]   Or maybe there'll be some more surprises
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.840]   and we'll discover that the droid is somehow
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.160]   going to have some connection with us.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.440]   It says, "used under license."
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.840]   So they obviously got permission to use it.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.880]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.240]   Wouldn't it be cool if it had Wookie fur cases and--
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.760]   I want to hear the Wookie ring.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   Wow.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.720]   And of course, we're going to see an ad from Apple
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.600]   saying, this is not the droid you're looking for.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.960]   Aw.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.480]   If I received jobs, that's what I would do.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.360]   So a big announcement this week started with Bing.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.760]   It kind of perturbed me a little bit.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.160]   Twitter announced that it had sold its fire hose,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.480]   all the data that comes out of Twitter,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.880]   something that does not give away easily or lightly,
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.600]   and many have asked for, to Bing for indexing.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.200]   Bing is also going to index Facebook.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.680]   And then Google said, Marissa Meyer said, oh no, we're doing it too.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.320]   We're calling it Google Social Search.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.360]   Both search engines-- so this is a good one for you, Danny.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.040]   Both search engines.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.760]   Is it real time search?
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.520]   What exactly are we talking about here?
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.440]   Well, that's part of the problem.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.760]   We talked about real time search.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.720]   And I tried to explain it like, if we were saying,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.680]   we're going to do image search and you do a search,
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.680]   you get images.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.840]   If you were talking video search and you do a search,
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.680]   you get videos.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.320]   So if I say we're having real time search--
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   Who are searching for--
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   What do you get real time?
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.000]   I mean, that's--
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.560]   For real good times.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.280]   And so the way I've seen it when we look at the different players,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.680]   it's either somebody tries to let you
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.840]   see the kind of microblog real time content that's out there,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.120]   the actual tweets where somebody may be saying what's going on,
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.480]   or they try to mind the links that are being tweeted
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.440]   or being Facebook-edid or whatever you want to call it
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.880]   that's put out there.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.920]   And so with Bing, they kind of went both ways.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.240]   They said, all right, if you want to see what people are saying,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.840]   we're going to try to show you the most authoritative tweets.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.400]   And we'll also show you the most tweeted links that are out
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.080]   there as well.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.040]   Google's social search is actually different and independent
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.680]   of the whole deal they cut with Twitter.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.600]   They actually were working on that before they had a deal
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   with Twitter.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.720]   And I've actually seen it.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.600]   And it's one of those things where I looked at it and I thought,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.680]   well, that's actually really cool.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.800]   It'll see all your followers that are, for example, on Twitter.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.840]   You do a search, and it will show you at the bottom of the page
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.240]   all the pages related or written by the people you follow,
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.560]   because it can figure out who you are,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.440]   and knows who they are.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.640]   And it can see who they've said which of their websites.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.520]   And it's kind of neat.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.480]   It like super personalizes some of your pages.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.800]   Which actually has nothing to do with it.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.320]   What's that?
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.120]   Sorry.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.040]   Can I put-- is it just Facebook followers,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.920]   or is it my email contacts, my fellow employees?
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.040]   What pools of people can I set the search against?
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.480]   On the social search, it'll tie into anybody
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.080]   you've indicated on your social profile.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.480]   So--
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.080]   It's your Google profile that it's using.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.120]   In Google, you have a profile.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.160]   On the profile, you can say, hey, this is my Twitter account.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.280]   You could say this is my LinkedIn account.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.440]   And if Google can get to that account,
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.000]   and then see the people who are listed as your friends,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.640]   and then in turn find them, and they've
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.800]   listed what their websites are, then it
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.320]   can use that as sort of a greater network.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.680]   Maybe they'll get more explicitly down the line,
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.680]   where you can actually go through and pick out individual people.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.680]   But Twitter is a very good way that way it starts off.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.320]   It can pretty flawlessly go through and say,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.000]   you say this is my Twitter account.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.760]   Look at all those people, find the blogs that they say
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.640]   that they own and operate, and refine the results that way.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's another reason to get your Google profile in a shape,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.200]   because it's going to be drawing information from here.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.560]   Well, and that's-- there's another reason they want to try
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.520]   to get you to do that, because they haven't had
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.800]   a whole bunch of luck in getting people
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.560]   to do much of social on Google.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.880]   Hey, I just went to my profile.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.120]   I noticed that there is a new tab in there.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.760]   There was about me.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   Now there's a side wiki tab that shows what I've written
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.000]   in my side wiki.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.760]   They seem to be integrating Google profiles
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.880]   with all the new products.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.240]   Your profile and wave is pulled solely
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.280]   from your Google profile, your profiles.google.com page, too.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.640]   So they're really pushing it.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.720]   Well, they need to if they're going to make a utility
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.760]   and give it some usefulness, right?
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.880]   Yeah, by the way, for the Twitter stuff--
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.200]   so they've got the social search that they kind of put out
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.160]   there, because they've got something in development.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.960]   They may still go ahead and do an actual Twitter search.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.440]   Down the line, you may actually be able to go to Google
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.280]   and search just Twitter stuff, specifically, not just
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.200]   tied to your friends.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.720]   But we're waiting to see what they'll do with that.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.880]   They just kind of really kind of said, look, we've got to deal,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.380]   too.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.040]   We've got to deal, too.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.960]   So in the blog post, they kind of talked about, well,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.480]   if there's a snowstorm coming, you could do a search
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.160]   and you'd see all the tweets about it.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.320]   Or if there's a traffic jam, you do a search.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.640]   So it sounded like there would be a search of the firehose
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.400]   in addition to a search of your friends, both of which
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.160]   have value.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.840]   What upset me?
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.120]   I'm glad to have it there.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.280]   But two things bothered me about the announcements.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.640]   The first is that Twitter and Facebook with Bing
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:35.000]   are presumably selling content that is not there as its hours.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.960]   And that if, as various folks, including Gina and Dave
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.520]   Weiner have asked if Twitter were instead of the cloud,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.840]   there'd be an API, and you could just search it.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.480]   It wouldn't be a case of making a deal like that
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.120]   to one person and not the other.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.720]   Though Ev has said that he intends
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.200]   to make this not competitive and open, which I hope
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.520]   I assume he'll do.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.200]   The second thing that bothers me is
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.160]   that it sets a terrible precedent,
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.880]   because these, I'll say it, idiot newspaper people,
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.120]   Danny writes about this, people here about in a few minutes,
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.440]   will now say, well, Google, you paid Twitter,
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.240]   you should pay us.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.640]   And of course, it's entirely different,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.320]   but it's going to confuse the hell out of their little brains.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.800]   They can't handle the truth.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.880]   So I actually tweeted that.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.760]   And that I thought this is the problem with silos,
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.840]   is that it isn't global.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.200]   In fact, we've had this conversation with Twitter before.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.080]   My friends, Ken Sheperson and Dustin Sailing's were saying,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.920]   they were doing a track service.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.240]   And they said, we would like the fire hose.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.480]   We could add some real utility to it.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.360]   We'll eat the bandwidth.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.240]   And Twitter really kind of dithered and said, yeah,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.560]   send me an email.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.400]   But you don't want it.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.280]   It's really big.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.920]   And Dustin said, I can handle it.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.680]   And I wasn't clear whether Twitter thought
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.800]   this was a monetization strategy.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.400]   And don't think so from what I've heard.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.240]   I don't know what Facebook is versus Twitter.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.920]   And I don't tinker.com has had the fire hose for a while.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.760]   Only if you have.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.600]   Yeah, so did the GNAB.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.480]   But you had to kind of get permission.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.880]   And I think that's the point, is that this should be kind of an open.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.080]   This information should be open.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.520]   We're all contributing it to Twitter.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.120]   A number of people said, well, if you don't like it,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.840]   don't use Twitter.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.760]   I don't think that's the answer either.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.120]   But I mean, the data is--
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.520]   I mean, there's an API available, right?
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.440]   And the data is accessible to everyone.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.600]   I mean, we're talking about the access to the--
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.320]   it's limited, right?
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.760]   We're talking about access to the fire hose, which is all the data
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.720]   are streaming real time, which is an incredible--
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.440]   You can only get a certain number of updates an hour if you use the API.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.000]   Right, right.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.440]   You can only get it right.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.560]   And so basically, they whitelist certain companies
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.240]   to make huge amounts of requests.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.440]   Your Twitter Linux program runs into that API limit, right?
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.080]   You would like the fire hose--
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.960]   I mean, you may not want it from a technical point of view,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.360]   but that would be valuable to you, wouldn't it?
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.240]   Right, yeah.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.520]   Yeah, I mean, the fire hose is valuable.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.400]   But I think that the bandwidth and the--
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.240]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.000]   I do think that Twitter should be distributed.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.320]   And I don't like the idea that all everybody's tweets
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.200]   are centralized on Twitter servers.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.360]   That said, I do think that Twitter's been really generous about opening up
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.200]   access to the data.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.440]   And I don't think they're withholding the fire hose access
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.880]   because they're trying to hold on to the data.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.080]   I think it's just a scaling issue.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:20.640]   I don't know.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.360]   I just want to guess.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.240]   What Dustin proposes, well, just if you have a bandwidth issue,
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.560]   send one copy of your fire hose to somebody who's willing to mirror it.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.760]   This is the issue, right?
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.960]   Because on the mailing list, the Twitter API mailing list,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.320]   that, I believe, does break Twitter's terms of service.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.880]   So you can't create a distributed network of nodes
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.640]   who request as much data as they can handle and then exchange it
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.240]   between one another, peer to peer.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.680]   And this is what we'd need to distribute it.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.640]   And this is the thing that I think I am definitely in favor of doing.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.360]   On what's the deal with Facebook?
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.200]   And did Facebook not do Google only Bing?
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.400]   And what's the deal with Facebook and Bing?
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.200]   Do we know?
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.800]   Well, I mean, Facebook and Bing.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   My understanding was they didn't say--
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.960]   I was Cheryl Sandberg, I said they didn't actually get any money
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.320]   for giving the data up.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.560]   So which was--
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.080]   And Twitter implied that they did.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.440]   It sounds like, yeah.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.120]   Yeah, I would-- we sure love to know what the terms were,
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.160]   because what did you get from this thing that everybody thinks
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.000]   is incredibly valuable?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   We don't even know that an ad deal was cut off of it.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.480]   But on Facebook, it's harder because I think people still don't quite
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.640]   realize that they're putting some of this stuff out in public.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.360]   You have to actually change it and say you want to put it out in public
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:33.880]   or whatever.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.560]   But I think Facebook was kind of sensitive to the idea
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.000]   that they don't want to suggest that they're just
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.560]   selling people's information.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.920]   Always the issue with Facebook.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.040]   Although they said that they would modify their user interface
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.360]   to give you a-- I mean, already you can say everyone.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.640]   You can have an everyone setting for your status updates
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.400]   and your photos and so forth.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   They said they would surface that more and make that more
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.440]   clear so that you could choose to have your data be part of that search.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.720]   But can you go to a Facebook profile and not be logged into Facebook
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.080]   and see that profile?
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.560]   No.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.080]   Well--
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   Well, no, yes.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   Somebody can make a--
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.480]   You can see some information about it.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.680]   Like some people spread.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.180]   Some information.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:13.680]   No, no.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.160]   You can choose to make everything-- I'm pretty sure you can choose to make
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.400]   everything available.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.240]   You go through, you have your limited profile, your public profile.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.320]   And that's where that everyone setting is.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.240]   And that's part of what-- and I think one of the twin things here
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.840]   is over the path to years, Facebook has opened up more and more
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.600]   information in particular to get traffic from Google.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.280]   More of this stuff out is out there, the events, the forums, the profile pages,
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.920]   because it brings them in traffic.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.280]   And so when you look at why, for example, Twitter would do this.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.400]   Twitter's been under pressure that, well, you're flattening off.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.680]   People aren't coming to the website.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.080]   We're not seeing enough information that's out there.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.040]   So when they do deals with being and they do deals with Google, on the one hand,
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.360]   you could say, well, they're giving away their most valuable information.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.640]   But on the other hand, they're putting this stuff out in these huge traffic
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   drivers.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.440]   And if that starts sending people back to the Twitter website,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.480]   they may feel like this is a good way to show that they still have growth going on.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.640]   Well, but I think the Twitter website at some point becomes irrelevant.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.240]   I hope so.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.080]   So what has to hope that they're-- I mean, they're still looking for the business model.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.200]   Hello, business model.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   Right.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.280]   So here's something I saw a minute ago.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.000]   I think this is the first company that's built for the Post page internet.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.240]   They just don't know what it means yet.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.200]   It's certainly valuable.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.920]   I mean, the idea that somebody dies or some event happens, there's a boy in the balloon
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.320]   to be able to see that real time.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.880]   And Google's been moving towards that with that sidebar thing that they do.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.240]   In the last hour or the last day, the last week.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.120]   But it's not really very valuable unless you have some sort of stream of information,
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.960]   like Twitter or Facebook that you're watching.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.200]   And that you do something to have more relevancy than the last thing that was posted
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.440]   as the first thing at the top of the page.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.600]   Yeah, curate it somehow.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.560]   How do you do that, though?
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.160]   I mean, that sounds like a human.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.640]   But that's where you go and you look at what Bing's saying that they're trying to do,
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.880]   which is look at the person who's tweeting, look at the amount of times they've been retweeted,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.320]   try to get some sense of the authority of the person putting the information out there,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.960]   as well as the authority of the tweet itself.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.240]   When I did a couple tests on it, they didn't really live up to the promises yet.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.920]   It's still a bait as we'll see how it goes.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.120]   But I was still seeing spam.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.080]   I was still seeing misleading stuff that was showing up there.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.560]   But yeah, that is the challenge.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.200]   How do you, you know, to play with the different signals you can get to see if you can come
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.160]   up with, if you will, some kind of a Twitter rank to know which Twitter is actually the
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.160]   most important thing to say there.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.960]   At the same time, a tinker is trying to cluster the tweets, like Google News or Daylight
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.280]   for where I'm a partner, are trying to do.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.880]   And it's really hard to analyze something 140 characters long.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.880]   And it's going to take a while.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.040]   But I think the more they can tie that to what's being linked to what's in a conversation,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.240]   what's you can at least, maybe you're not getting into the authority that Danny's talking
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.640]   about, but you're getting totally clusters of smarter views of what truly hot topics
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.720]   really are and what's within those, what are the links within those, what are people
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.280]   talking about?
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.280]   Authority is really the issue.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.040]   And how do you measure it?
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.920]   Well, when Matt Cutz was on a couple weeks ago, Leo, when you were in Dubai, he was saying
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.440]   that he felt like Google PageRank works, you know, works on Twitter just as well, because
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.720]   people who get retweeted, you know, those things are links inbound links.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.360]   And so you can tell authority, you know, not based on Twitter's internal metrics, like
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.080]   how many followers people have and how many times they've been retweeted and how many
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.360]   lists they're on or whatever the popularity metric or the week is, that PageRank actually
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.960]   does scale to those because things get linked.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.160]   I think authority breaks down, though, in a real-time world.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.000]   It's not as effective as the blog world where you have time to stew and get more links
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and accumulate links.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.400]   If you don't get retweeted where we tweet, we tweet it right away.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.680]   But don't you always, when you get retweeted, it happens pretty easily.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   It's instantly, doesn't it, though?
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.360]   I mean, I find that response to my tweets is basically the first hour.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.280]   That could be a measure more of how many people follow you and how engaged your followers
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.280]   are and what you're saying.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.520]   In other words, it's an authority, but it's authority.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.120]   It's a very kind of, this is Mr. tweet said this to me.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:16.920]   He said, "It depends, you know, to your kids are authoritative to you, Jeff."
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.040]   I mean, what Jake says is authoritative, but completely unauthoritative to everybody.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   I guess if everybody's--
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.520]   That's why one-size-fits-all doesn't work.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.120]   That's why I think things like Twitter lists become interesting because you start to cluster
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.240]   people around topics and then that starts to establish a new authority when you understand
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.680]   what the topic is.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.040]   Fred Wilson, who invested in Twitter, was tweeting about this and wondering whether the
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.560]   Twitter list was the new follower.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   I disagree.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.360]   I think it's more like the new blog role.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.920]   Or what I really want is tags.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.160]   I want to tag Gina in a list of people who are really authoritative about technology
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.040]   and other things different from Jay Rosen about journalism, different from somebody else
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   about politics.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.640]   But they might be in the same list, so they're subdivided in that list by tags.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   Or other in somebody's different list and as you start to see who's associated with whom,
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.340]   you now start to see who's retweeting whom, who's associated with whom, who's quoting
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.520]   whom, who's writing about what.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.840]   It's the same exact kind of structure the blogs have tried to do for quite some time.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.640]   Who's in a constellation?
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.400]   Well, if you have that, you may not have authority per se, but you might have a sense
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.560]   of topicality.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.480]   I think lists, it's really interesting how the ecosystem can be changed so dramatically
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.160]   by something so simple.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.680]   I think lists changes everything on Twitter.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.640]   It's a whole other number to obsess about.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   It is.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   Initially.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   Yeah, I said that.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.040]   I didn't know that Fred said it, but I said it as well.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   Forget the follower number.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.000]   It's not how many lists you're on that matters.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.400]   Of course, it doesn't matter yet because everybody doesn't have lists.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.720]   But once everybody gets lists, that's going to be a big number.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.520]   I should say this for the wish list time, but that's all I have.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.040]   I look at people who are at conferences and stuff and they have a hashtag for the conference,
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.520]   but I come in halfway in and I wonder where are they?
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.520]   Right.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.520]   And I can't figure out where that is.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.880]   I wish we had a simple little nomenclature that says something like hashtag set hashtag
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.400]   what you're using for the conference so that you can go look up and see what is this
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   hashtag me.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.240]   Why did somebody put it in there?
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.960]   It's really, it's two things.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.120]   There's two things here at work, taxonomy and authority.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.720]   And they're both really important.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   And they're related.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.520]   They're interrelated because authority within the taxonomy is important.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.000]   But it's a folksonomy.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's a folksonomy, exactly.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   It's what you're saying.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I know you're not disagreeing.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   We're not disagreeing.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   But I think that's the important thing is how do you make it emergent?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Right.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Right.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.520]   Rather than determined.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.400]   Fauxonomy is a taxonomy that's determined by people at Hock as it goes.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   Is that?
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   Emerges.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   Jeff, have you tried Brizzly?
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   No, you got me, Gina.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   I'm a Brizzlier.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.240]   It's a Twitter interface.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.560]   It's actually a web based Twitter interface.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.320]   It's basically like the Twitter website just better.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.880]   And one thing that it has on the side bar is that it lists all the current trending topics
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   on Twitter.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.840]   And then there's a little link that says why.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.240]   And you click on that and you get an explanation of like why this topic exists.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.040]   And it sounds like that's what you're interested in for hash for general for all hashtags.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.360]   Like hashtags for my friends.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.760]   What do they mean?
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.720]   The why is a wiki is a wiki why because anybody can add to the why.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.680]   Modify the one for life, I think.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.720]   Yeah, why button is so fun.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   I love my iPhone.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.920]   I could just hit it anytime and say why.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   Why?
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.560]   Brizzly is very cool.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.960]   It's also we'll send you an invitation, Jeff.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   Thank you.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   Yeah, because I think it's still invite only.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   I just looked at.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   Yeah, I feel left out.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.640]   I guess I can it says, oh, I can.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   You know, that's right.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.240]   You can invite somebody right, you have to tweet about it.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.320]   There's people are getting people are getting the social engineering going on now is just
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.320]   stunning.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.000]   Yeah, yeah, I love Brizzly.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.200]   I didn't love that part.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   Okay.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.440]   All right, I'm going to Jeff quickly go to my Twitter account.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   Okay.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.480]   I'm going to tweet this.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.480]   Invite Jeff.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   Jump.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.840]   All right, ready?
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.080]   One, two, three.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.080]   Yes.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.080]   Tweet this.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.080]   We'll see how long it lasts.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   The last time I did it, they lasted about three seconds.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   Oh, it's nice.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.800]   You pay tribute to soupy sales.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.280]   Yeah, I love soupy sales grew up with soupy sales.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.840]   And I think I was no idea what we're talking about.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.080]   You don't know who soupy sales is?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.480]   Well, I'll give you a hint.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.800]   Probably the only you know, you'd only see you'd only know by seeing old kinema scopes
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.960]   in black and white.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   It's how long it goes.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.400]   Soupy sales was on TV.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.160]   I am Wikipediaing it right now.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.760]   Yeah, you'll find some on YouTube.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.360]   It's an interesting kind of goofy sense of humor.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.680]   Jeff, you and I were probably kids when soupy sales was at his heyday.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.320]   So that's why we still have a soft spot for him and Fang.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   There I am.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   Good.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.920]   Well, that's one way to do it.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.240]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.120]   Come back with more with our guests.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.680]   What a great team here.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.440]   Of course, Gina and Jeff, always the greatest.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   But Danny Sullivan is also here of search engine land dot com, a guy who's been an observer
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.800]   in this scene.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.120]   13 years.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.920]   Wow, Danny.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.280]   I'll talk more.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:24.560]   I want to talk more about all this stuff, but first a word from our friends.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.520]   It's Citrix, the folks who do those fabulous programs go to my PC, go to meeting.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:35.480]   And for those of you who are in the support business, go to assist expressive.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   You heard about this one?
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.520]   This is fantastic.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.560]   I think it was a, was a Colleen that was just using this a second ago?
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.240]   You thought it was great, didn't you?
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   It's amazing.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   So here's the thing.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.880]   You got to assist somebody, you know, phone support kind of thing.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.640]   And that's painful.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.240]   You don't ever want to, you don't ever want to have to do this.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.840]   And you know, you're taught, there's a great video of John Meyer, the, you know, your
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.800]   body is a waterland guy.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.120]   Somebody got him in a cell phone video of him talking to his dad on the phone.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.480]   He's like outside the concert hall.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.880]   He's going, no dad, no.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.880]   Okay.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   It's under the apple.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   It's system preferences.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.400]   Okay, dad, no, no, don't click that.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   No.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   And it's very end.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.800]   The very end he says, dad, no, don't give up.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   You can do this.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.720]   And I really fell for him.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.800]   I know how that was.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.360]   And I tell you, if I had a coupon code to send him, then I would have sent it to him
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.600]   for go to assist express.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   I'm going to send it to you right now.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:39.640]   You go to go to assist.com/twig-t-w-i-g and you can sign up for 30 days free.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.920]   So they're using all their great remote access software, but they're using it for support
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   professionals.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.360]   Now, individuals can use this.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   They have a day pass.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.400]   So if you, you know, you've got the need for it, you can use it.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.360]   But really it's aimed at the support pro.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.320]   There's some features that make it particularly useful for you.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.040]   For instance, unattended support, you know, normally with a remote access, the other
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.520]   guys got to be there.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.760]   With this, once you set it up, you can get into their machine at any time and do the
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   work.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.760]   You can have eight sessions at once.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.040]   And at any time anybody's done support, you know, you start an install or you start
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.240]   a scan.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240]   Now what?
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   You sit there, you read a book.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.080]   No, you go to the next one and the next one and the next one makes you much more efficient.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   It has another feature.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.240]   I really like the, it has an assay of what operating system is running on the remote machine.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.280]   What security software, all the programs running in the background, that'll save you.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.880]   A lifetime of trouble.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.680]   Really a fantastic solution.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.320]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.880]   Go to G-O-T-O-A-S-S-I-S-T.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.880]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.080]   Secure 128-in-bit encryption 24/7 support.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.240]   The easiest, the best.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.040]   If you want to start a support session, you just send them a link or you can get it on
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.760]   chat and you say, "Here, go here."
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.800]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.200]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.280]   We thank them so much for their support of this weekend.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   Google.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   Google.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.320]   You must have been a kid when you started the search engine watch way back when.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.080]   I wish I were a kid.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.600]   What was the motive?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.160]   First of all, I mean, 1996, there's barely even blogging at the time.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.280]   Yes, we didn't have blogs.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.920]   I'd have been a blogger back then, but we didn't.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.960]   So what did you -- I want just a web page about search engines?
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960]   Web pages.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.040]   Isn't that funny?
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.600]   But you were essentially blogging.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.360]   I mean, that was it.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:37.960]   I had left newspapers, did web development for a year, had clients who couldn't understand
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.880]   why they weren't showing up on search engines.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.680]   So really started looking into the whole situation on how they operated and published
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.320]   everything that I had found out as something I called a webmaster's guide to search engines.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.760]   It had both tips that you needed to know.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.080]   And also look at the marketplace because at the time we had so many search engines and
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.160]   some of them were incredibly difficult to submit to.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.720]   You could spend hours literally filling out these forms that they wanted you to do.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.800]   So I wanted to know the important ones.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.320]   So just kind of carried on with that.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.160]   And it took off.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.840]   It became my new career, the new beat that I was following.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.840]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.840]   But it was just web pages.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.320]   I used WordPress today.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.120]   I wish I had stuff like that back then.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   I was writing on front page and pushing stuff across that.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.720]   You didn't have a content management system.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.680]   You were just hand coding the pages.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   Not at first.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.680]   Oh my God.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   Just writing it off and pushing it across.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.360]   Well, I mean front page was a nice actually good content management system.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.760]   You could do everything locally.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.240]   I worked off of a modem until 2004.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.720]   I lived in Old Village in Britain.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.920]   So we didn't have broadband.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   Wow.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.080]   It was a real treat when I finally got that.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   It was just nice.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.920]   So you're a patient man.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.720]   Which is a required trait for a blogger by the way.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.960]   You have to be very patient.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.720]   And you obviously are.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   Wow.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.040]   I mean, that's amazing.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   What a story.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   That's wonderful.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.440]   Yeah, I remember we would check in with it to see.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:05.280]   I mean, watch had some of the implication of watch dog too, didn't it?
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.280]   Well that was it.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.080]   At the time when I started we had a number of watch sites that had begun.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   There was a board watch.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.600]   And I think there was internet watch.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.720]   And so I thought, well, okay, I'll slap watch on the end of the name.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.360]   And that'll fit in with the whole kind of thing.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.400]   Clearly today I should have called it Crunch or something.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.320]   But you know, that stuff.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.880]   So but yeah, so just carried on with it from there.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.560]   Crunch makes no sense by the way.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.320]   I never understand.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.200]   All these crunch sites now.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.600]   Well they, you know, the brand gets built up.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.240]   And you know, I suppose the idea of the watch type of thing, you know, kind of fits in with
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   it.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.680]   But you know, you get these different things, you get slapped onto the end of words and
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.760]   they make them distinguished in some way I suppose.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.440]   Twitter, was it, were you surprised by this Twitter deal when I, when I, when I, this
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.800]   real time deal that came across?
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.720]   Um, a bit on the timing.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.720]   I hadn't really thought, oh, went to Pointo's coming up.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.480]   They'll probably finally roll this stuff out.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   Right.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   As part of that.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.720]   Because you knew about, you knew about the social search.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.000]   And again, the social search independent of Twitter, they were able to do that, which
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.760]   is the stuff they could see in the public.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.560]   That's not really real time, that's tapping into your social network.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.720]   The real time aspect, maybe something completely new that'll come.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   Right.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.000]   But the, um, that the timing that it was announced on that particular day was a surprise that
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.080]   Google, you know, a couple hours later managed to get their own deal together and say, we
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.080]   have one too.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.440]   It was definitely a surprise.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.120]   I thought they'd probably have to take a couple more days to hammer out whatever it was they
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.120]   needed to finish doing.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.120]   Right.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   Made for an exciting day.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.120]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.040]   I had an announcement this week, uh, Wolfram Alpha has an API, but it's, it's paid.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.640]   Paid, paid, no paid.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.840]   For 50 bucks, you can get the iPhone.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.280]   I don't understand that at all.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.520]   I mean, you could still use the webpage for free.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.520]   Right.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.600]   Has anybody had the initiative to buy the iPhone app just to see what you get?
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   I've got it.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.360]   I'll try to get it up in a minute.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.800]   I couldn't get it to work.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.600]   I had a demo thing that they sent across and, um, it.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.600]   I'm very curious.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   I mean, what could you get for 50?
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   I mean, that's, you get a price.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.440]   You get an app on your phone.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.080]   You were the scientific calculator.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.320]   I don't think you see that.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.320]   Oh, look at that.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.400]   What it looks like a keyboard.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   What is that?
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   Yeah, it is.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.960]   It's sort of, it's like a little search box on it and it's got a huge keyboard underneath
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.160]   with a lot of both numbers and letters, which I think is probably designed for some of the
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.320]   mathematicians that they think they want to use.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   So it is.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.200]   So it's, it's, as Jeff said, it's kind of a knowledge calculator.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   Well, it's, you know, I think that they, who knows?
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.360]   I mean, I think they, it is in the same way that Wolfram on the site itself is.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.960]   I think that they figure that you're going to have some people who are really into the
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.920]   kind of data that they can use that aren't going to think twice about paying $50.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   Right.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.600]   And which is an interesting change because the website was designed to be more, hey,
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.040]   anybody should be able to use this.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.440]   So, and in the time since they launched that site, I think it's fair to say it hasn't really
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   taken off.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.800]   You know, you, at one point you had people talking about it as being a Google killer
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   or this huge revolution.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   No, no.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   Just kind of sitting there.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   It's too difficult to, to figure out.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.520]   I mean, if, if I almost wish I would just, it could take, you know, a few days and think
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.240]   of, and kind of start to understand how to, how to make queries.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.640]   If you know how to make queries, it's very valuable.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.240]   That's why I'm going to be powerful on top of it is you could take something that's complicated.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.400]   Like I don't know, wave and Wolfram Alfa and create engines that would be usable.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.720]   Wolfram, that makes sense.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.760]   But if the AP has expensive, it's going to limit the use of the API.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.160]   If you want 50,000 requests, it'll cost you $2,100 and a nickel, nickel a request after
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.160]   that.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   Holy crap.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   Excuse my reaction.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   That's, that's not so.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:57.560]   And 50,000 requests isn't that much.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.560]   No.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.200]   Oh, oh.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.160]   And we're used to making mistaken requests and going back at it.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:09.080]   I can't tell you how many times I locked myself out of Twitter developing my Twitter app.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.680]   If you wanted a personal use plan, that would be a thousand requests.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.960]   That would be 60 bucks.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.800]   And then after that, eight cents a request.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.880]   But I don't know.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.880]   Is that for a year?
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.480]   I don't know if the term is.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   Company?
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.240]   Well, they have to pay for all this stuff.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.680]   A thousand requests a day and hour.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   Month.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680]   Month.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   That's a monthly, monthly plan.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.920]   All you get in the end is knowledge that is already somewhere on the internet or somewhere
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   in a book.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   I take it back.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.680]   The personal plan is that you buy a block of requests.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.560]   And when you use ups a thousand, you buy another one.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.200]   The developer and business plans are monthly.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:51.360]   I think I'd spend my time figuring out how I could scrape the website from different
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.520]   IP addresses to not have to fix the thing.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.520]   No.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   You get the same data, right?
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.520]   It's not like.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.520]   It's not from the web, it's from books and things like that.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.800]   But still, if you scrape the Wolfram Alpha, you just write an interface to Wolfram Alpha.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.240]   You couldn't do it.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.160]   I should say, I think Wolfram Alpha is really cool.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.680]   Oh, I love it.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.280]   And Danny's point actually is really interesting.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.320]   I mean, the seller was that this data should be available not just to hardcore researchers.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   It should be available to anyone.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.680]   But then they're charging $50 for an iPhone app.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   For a price.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.480]   Although, I guess that's not much more than some desktop software.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   So I don't know.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:35.920]   I guess if you're a mathematician and you know Mathematica and you do these sorts of things,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.800]   this might be a great calculator type for you to use.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.720]   I'm not, so it makes nothing to me.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.960]   I did another thing where you've got it.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.040]   I don't know if you can see it again.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.560]   But one of the examples they were putting in there, so I got to go this way, is like
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   Big Mac calories.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.440]   And it's what you get on the web.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.680]   You go up there and it'll tell you how many calories you've got along, 45, 3 or whatever.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.120]   Don't cut this a lot of calories.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.360]   But I could do that.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.560]   I think I can do that just launching Safari and going to Wolf mouth on the web.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.920]   So if you're not doing the calculations, I don't think that you probably are going to
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.800]   want to make much use of this.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   It's interesting.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   I mean, I guess they need money.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.880]   Well, but I think they need to package different versions of it or they need to enable
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   the API to be made in different things.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.640]   And if it's just web knowledge like Big Mac calories, there's no reason.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.600]   Where you still working for that.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:33.400]   This is also really common though for it's really common for companies that launch these
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.680]   new search products and they don't quite know what they're going to do that where they end
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.320]   up that could be radically different.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.760]   A classic example was Applied Semantics.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.240]   And this was back in 1997, 98.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.640]   And their whole goal was to try to help you search better with search refinement, all these
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   things.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.640]   It became AdSense.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.600]   I mean, their product was actually called AdSense.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.760]   Google launched their own AdSense product under a different name.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.080]   They ended up buying Applied Semantics and bringing some of that technology in.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.880]   But it was supposed to be this thing for like scientists and researchers and it turned into
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.480]   an ad product, like radically different.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.240]   So I think Wolfram is probably going to throw a lot of stuff against the wall and try to
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.320]   figure out what's going to stick, especially given the investment they put into it.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   And they may not know.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.620]   And I think Wolfram actually said that at one point.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.760]   He didn't quite know what might happen with this.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.600]   So I'm sure we'll see even more evolutions of it going along.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.080]   But at this point, I think he'd use some VC money to open it up and figure out what it
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.080]   is.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   Right.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.960]   That's to me the issue is that it is too soon to close up in a way that's going to lead
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.640]   to really interesting development.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:42.720]   You have an article in your blog, Jeff Howard Stern 3.0, The Future of Entertainment.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:50.160]   Well, I was listening to Howard on my Sirius radio and I'm a Howard fan this week.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.240]   Because he's the other guy who talks about penises.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.880]   You know, yeah, it's you and Howard.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.880]   The two of you.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.360]   And so I heard something and because of my new Sirius radio, I could back it up like a
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   Tivo and listen to it.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.720]   I got to hear that again.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:08.920]   And Howard talked about what he could do tomorrow on the internet and how obviously
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.960]   we all know this could, you know, everybody could watch him and he could listen to him
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   live.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.040]   You could listen to him on the iPhone and he said, and I wouldn't have to work for a
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   company.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.080]   I saw the future of Howard.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.760]   And so then Tim Windsor came in the comments and said, well, that's Leo.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   That's exactly what I'm doing.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.200]   And the whole point of it was precisely I'd be my own company.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   I didn't want to have to work for anybody.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.000]   Well, I think you should give Howard a tutorial.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.240]   I should give him a call.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   Howard though.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   Howard though.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.120]   I said post with that to Gary Dellebotte.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.920]   Have you ever talked to Howard or called it?
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.040]   No, but I mean, I think it's really interesting that here's a guy who had, you know, maybe
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:54.800]   10 to 15 million listeners, went for the gold partly because he was just fed up with
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.480]   the FCC and broadcast.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.520]   So he took half a billion dollars from Sirius and went from, we don't know, but went probably
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.840]   from 15 million listeners to fewer than a million listeners.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.440]   No, no, no, it's more than that.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.240]   He brought in a loan, eight million people.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   Did he?
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   Okay.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.240]   And they can listen time and time again.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.400]   So, you know, the guessing is that it could be four or five, but that's guessing.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.200]   It's still a big drop.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   But it's a lot of money and it's freedom.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.680]   But on the internet again, I'm supposed to be the guy who's against paid content, but
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.040]   I pay for Howard now.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.400]   I pay for Howard on the internet.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.880]   He would have a direct relationship with people.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.800]   There'd be no middleman.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.000]   You know, he's you.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.240]   And he wants to do video and he wants to do the exact things you're doing.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.760]   And how much does your whole, you have a deluxe Cadillac set up right now, right?
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.520]   You were to recommend to somebody to have, you know,
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.120]   It's cigarette money for Howard.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.280]   It's, you know, for well under a hundred thousand he could do this.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   Well under.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   I mean, that's, that's easy.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.280]   That's easy.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.200]   And we're doing, we did two and a half million in revenue this year.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.120]   That's awesome, Leo.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.760]   So there's money in this.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.200]   And I mean, Howard, look, if you make half a billion dollars, you probably don't need
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   to work anymore.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.720]   Well, I think he was making that point too.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:12.560]   He was complaining about Rush Limbaugh selling tacky chairs and t-shirts and stuff.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.080]   And Gary Della body was asking him and saying, well, you know, it's a big deal.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.080]   You have a million dollars, Howard.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.360]   And he, Howard was saying, no, you don't need that.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.680]   You don't want to rip off your list.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   He's right.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.520]   And so I think he's going to earn himself.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.040]   Plus my thought is that serious.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.520]   He got some major proportion of that payment probably in stock, right?
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.520]   As a serious stock.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.520]   I'll tell you.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   Not worth the whole lot.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.960]   I'm very happy that my Google is up and my Amazon is way up.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.600]   My Apple's doing well, but my serious is.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.560]   Well, I really, I mean, it really is the future of broadcasting.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:49.040]   It's funny because my motivation is very similar to his because any, I'll tell you, everybody
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.580]   I ever met in radio, their dream was to own a radio station.
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.400]   And the reason was not because you make so much money owning a radio station, but because
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.760]   then you'd be the boss, nobody to tell you what to do.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.960]   No fakak the program director to tell you to put on.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.520]   It's a stupid motivation, frankly, but that's the motivation.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.640]   And it was certainly what motivated me.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.800]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:16.080]   I mean, Hey Howard, you know, I'm sure he listens to twig.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.320]   Anytime dude, just come on over.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.960]   I'll show you how we do it.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.960]   It's simple.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.160]   That's the motivation for people who love it.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.040]   Yeah, you know what I yes, you exactly right.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.600]   You show the way Leo.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.160]   It's your motivation to Gina, right?
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.280]   It's all of our motivation.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.360]   We want to do what we love.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.920]   We don't want any limits on it.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.880]   We don't want somebody saying, where's our TP six report?
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.480]   You got to, you know, we got to come to another meeting.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.000]   We just want to do what we love.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.520]   Yeah, I do it just because I can't stand the idea shutting up.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.440]   And not writing.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.520]   I think I would explode.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.840]   But you know, that's a particular kind of personality.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:56.320]   I think it's in some ways, you know, we've lived in a patronage system since Leonardo,
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.880]   you know, where an artist can't create without a rich wealthy patron.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.560]   And it's mass media has really been an example of that.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.280]   Jeff doesn't get to write unless, you know, somebody at time life says he can write.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.360]   I don't get to do a radio show unless somebody at Clear Channel says I can do a radio show.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.560]   It really is a patronage system.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.000]   And I don't know if artists know how to live in a world where they don't have to have patrons.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.520]   The only patrons are your consumers.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   Are you listening?
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.520]   Are you listening?
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.520]   The post.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.520]   Sorry.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.520]   Have you seen Kickstarter?
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.520]   No, what's that?
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   Yeah, Kickstarter is cool.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   Kickstarter is fascinating.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.120]   It's designed right now for artists and authors and journalists and such.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.280]   But I think it's a fundamental economic change because the idea is that you can go in there
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.160]   and the guy who designed Obama's campaign went in there and said if I raise 60,000
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.920]   bucks enough to pay for the first printing, we'll create the book.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.840]   So I went in and I pre-ordered the book.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.480]   You could, Robin Sloan, who was a current TV, who's an Internet pioneer, is trying to
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   write a novel right now.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.680]   And he put it in a mount in there and said if I get enough money, I'll write it.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.760]   And so it's really rather like the 1% rule of Wikipedia.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:05.240]   If enough patrons choose to support you, then you do it and you do it for the whole world
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   then.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.680]   You might still sell it.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.120]   And maybe the patrons get some benefit.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.080]   Now how committed are you if you commit?
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.080]   I mean, what does it play to me?
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   You give them your credit card.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.080]   That's it.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.080]   If they do it, you're paying.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:22.440]   But you might be able to go to a movie lot to watch it being made or go to the premiere
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   or something like that.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   You've invested, it's like Spot.us for journalism.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.040]   You've invested in this thing.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.040]   Geez.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.640]   This has been around when I was trying to build to it.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   This is fantastic.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   Exactly.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.440]   I talked to Fred Wilson, the VC about it this week.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.840]   He's the one who kind of glued me in on the bigger picture.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.640]   And he was talking about somebody he knows who wants to start a kickboxing studio.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   And he can go to something like this and say, "Give me a thousand bucks.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.400]   You'll get free kickboxing for a year."
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.040]   But I'm free-funded.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:58.160]   I basically go on to my customers proactively and gotten the money in to fund the business
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.760]   without having to go to another damn middleman.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.280]   Yeah, it's like micro-patriated, right?
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   Like Kiva.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.280]   It's like Kiva for Patriated.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.960]   Like Jason Kotki a few years ago, he said he kind of ran a micro-patriated drive and
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.360]   said, "Hey, just give me five, ten bucks.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.960]   And I'm trying to raise enough money so that I can support my blogging habit and make it
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.600]   a full-time job for a year."
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.760]   And he did incredibly well.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   He already had a platform.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.320]   But that's what Kickstarter does is that gives you this platform to do that.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.320]   Right.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.400]   So I just kind of bootstrapped it, but it's the same idea.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.360]   I mean, you know, of course, I'm in a little bit different because I'm in free media.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   So the money comes from advertisers as opposed to the audience.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   Right.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.960]   But I think you can do either here.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.560]   I think you can start most anything this way.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.920]   I like this better.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.480]   We would have, I mean, what we, my plan when we started Twit was never to take advertising,
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.520]   just let the, let the, have a direct drive mechanism, you know, that people who listen
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   to it pay for it.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.120]   And it's the ultimate consumer research.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.760]   And if people won't pull me up, then, you know, you shouldn't do it.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.160]   Wow, it's fascinating.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.160]   Isn't it?
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.320]   Jeff, are you going to use Kickstarter to do a project?
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.360]   I have this book that I wanted to do about saving newspapers.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.520]   And my editor said, "Please, no, please don't propose that.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.520]   No, don't do it."
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.520]   [laughter]
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.000]   My pick-and-check story would end just, you know, thumb my nose and see what's what.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   The problem is I have to actually do it then.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Right.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   It's like having a hundred losses.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.360]   Now I'm looking at the front page and I wonder how many, I mean, there's got to be many,
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.200]   many, many, many more projects in here who never do get funded.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.280]   What's interesting too, though, I bet that was also a notion of investment.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.560]   So Gina, I would invest in you writing, you know, Android apps.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   You bet.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   You bet.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.160]   And if you got enough money to say, "Okay, Gina says it's worth three weeks of my time
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.160]   to do this.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.160]   I got enough money to do that.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.160]   I'll put it up."
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:51.640]   And, you know, I get the app free or I get some tutorial from Gina or I get some benefit
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.160]   or you pay back your investors at some point.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.160]   Just me.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.160]   Right.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.160]   You're throwing the money.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.160]   That's interesting.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.440]   Yeah, I've been, I've been, Kickstarter is quite tempting, isn't it?
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.520]   It really does give you that license of like, "Oh, all those, all those things that I wanted
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.320]   to do, I bet, you know, this really can help me do it."
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.360]   We live in exciting times, don't we?
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   We do.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:16.040]   Here's a new web page from Google, Google Freedom of Expression.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.320]   It's a YouTube page.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.560]   What's the idea behind this?
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:26.360]   In honor of the Berlin Wall's fall, that's the German PR director from Google you're showing
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360]   there.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:32.440]   Kai over back, I think his name is, and they wanted to open up a page about why Freedom
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.440]   of Expression matters.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.440]   I think that's great.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.120]   You know, Google and we all live on that.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:41.480]   My smart ass response to it is also, "I wonder whether this is being seen in China."
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.640]   Guarantee not.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:50.920]   It's kind of like a few years ago they did a big thing on, for their book service, and
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.520]   they talked about Band Books Week and how bad that was.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.960]   It was the same sort of thing.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.920]   So we, you're against Band Books in the US, but we'll ban certain things in China.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   You know, okay.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   We have the other, the double irony here, Danny, is that Chinese publishers are now going
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   after Google for copyright.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.320]   Good luck with that.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.720]   Hope that works out for him.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.220]   She's.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   Let's see here.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.520]   Should we talk about reindrop?
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   Yes.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   I've been waiting for that, Gina.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   Driscollino.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.200]   What is reindrop?
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:32.080]   So Mozilla, which is my other kind of cloud company love, is launching a new product called
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.000]   reindrop, which is interesting.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.840]   There are two interesting things to note about it, and it's not available yet, right?
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.600]   So there's just demo videos out there.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.240]   The first one is that it's a web application.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.640]   So it's not Firefox, it's not Thunderbird, it's not an installable app, right, which
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.440]   is different, a different for Mozilla.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.680]   It's a web app.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.320]   And what it does, I mean, it's kind of trying to solve the same problem that Google Wave
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.040]   is, but in a different way.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.280]   And this seems to be, this seems to be like the 2009, you know, sell for new, new messaging
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.600]   apps is, you know, what email would be, you know, what email should be or a better email.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.640]   This has been on for a while, but I think Wave really kind of brought it up, brought
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   it along.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   Reindrop is basically, it's a messaging application.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.760]   So Google Wave takes email and says this should be document, you know, it's really document
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.760]   collaboration.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.760]   That's really what you're doing.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:20.280]   But Reindrop is saying, no, we want to give you an easier way to manage your messages.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.320]   So what it does, the premise is that, you know, your mom sends you an email and that
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.160]   email shouldn't get pushed down by another message from some mailing list that you only
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:33.760]   browse, that there's a, you know, message should be prioritized differently based on
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.160]   who they're from and how important those people are to you.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.480]   And that's the whole point of Reindrop.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.880]   It's going to integrate your messages from different platforms, Twitter, Facebook, your
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.240]   email, all the different places where you can get communications.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.680]   And then it's going to smartly prioritize those based on how important they are to
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   you.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.400]   You know, we've heard a few, a few different companies and products have tried to solve
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.440]   this problem and it really hasn't been solved yet.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.040]   So it'll be interesting to see what Reindrop does, but, but there are a couple of design
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.160]   mockups on Flickr and there are a few demo videos on Demio.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.800]   Isn't this kind of stuff really hard to do?
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   I think so.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   I think so.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   But I don't know.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.920]   I mean, now that if you use one unified app to interact, I think that you can, it can
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.200]   figure out what the support contacts are.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   I mean, based on your activity.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.920]   I mean, it's something that, it's something that you email ought to be able to do right
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:27.920]   now, right?
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.400]   I mean, it, or any inbox system that's looking at the people that you're already sending
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.240]   to a lot, it should be able to know what you send to this person a lot.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.720]   So I'm going to make sure that's prioritized.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.680]   And this is one of the things that Yahoo was talking about with their inbox that they were
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.000]   spending a lot of time saying, well, you'll be able to identify who your friends are.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   You'll be able to tag them this way.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.200]   You'll tag them that way.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.080]   And first, I thought, well, I don't want to spend all that time.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.800]   I just want you to do the work and figure it out magically and make it happen.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.120]   And so, yeah, if you just look at the contacts that are going along, you ought to be able
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.120]   to do it.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.720]   I mean, Gmail already has like a most frequently contacted or suggested contacts.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.160]   I forget what they call it.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:09.680]   But if you go into Gmail contacts, they do have a by frequency list.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.680]   So they should be able to do that.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.480]   And I think part of what Raindrop is saying is that the way that we get notifications
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.880]   from different systems like Twitter and Facebook is that they send us email notifications.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.840]   So if Leo sends me a Facebook message, the message appears to be from Facebook, but it's
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.280]   actually from Leo.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.080]   And I think the idea is that Raindrop would be aware of Leo's identity and be able to let
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.560]   me know like, hey, this is Leo.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.040]   We'll cross those phones.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.040]   You're Google reader, you're Facebook, you're Twitter, you're email, everything.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.040]   Right.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.900]   And then I'll rhythmically try to help prioritize it for you.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:38.900]   Right.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.560]   It's the dream that the five smart suppliers are talking about.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.200]   And listeners get mad at me when I say this again, but the hyper personal news stream.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.200]   Right.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   Right.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.200]   You've really got both companies working on this.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.920]   You know, it wouldn't be hard for Google to bring together your reader and your Gmail
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   and your Twitter now and something else and learn enough about you to try to try to prioritize.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.400]   In fact, it seems like this is something Google would be better at than anybody.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.040]   I mean, they know more about us than anybody.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.600]   You've got Gmail already configured so that you can pull in from multiple email accounts.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.200]   So you can bring in your Yahoo mail, you can bring in your Hotmail if you've got that
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   account.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.960]   You can bring all that stuff into one central inbox.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.440]   If they had a way for them to actually, I mean, I get stuff sent to me on Facebook and
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.720]   what's annoying to me is I've got enough inboxes to deal with.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.520]   So most of my Facebook mail gets ignored.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.520]   Absolutely.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   But if that was actually coming in through iMac or pop or something like that as actual
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   regular mail message, then that would kind of solve the issue of knowing that it really
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.200]   is you and who that person is as well.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   But why not roll Google voice into it as well?
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   And why?
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.440]   I mean, you put my voicemail and my text messages in there, put all contacts into that.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.760]   And who's going to do that better than Google?
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.080]   I mean, Google's got it got all the way.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.080]   That'll be way.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.920]   No, we will be everything.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   It's a baby.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.360]   We'll take care of everything for you.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.520]   Is there a wave backlash you think there are people.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.480]   People are starting to turn on wave, aren't they?
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.160]   I think they're just turning on us for talking about it all the time.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.160]   That could be it.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   No, no.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.280]   It's a combination of the people feeling left out because they weren't invited and also
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.200]   the just like WTF factor, which is like, you know, what is it?
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:20.840]   I hear that most from people who got a wave invite finally and said, oh, what is this?
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.120]   Yeah, I got the it's like the day after Christmas.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:28.360]   I got the invite and I'm in and.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.080]   I also think there's a little bit of not vetted here going on of people.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.400]   You can turn into an old fart really early and some of the people I won't name names who
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.360]   have complained about it.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.160]   I think say, well, I invented the future of the Internet.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.160]   They can't do that.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.800]   Let me think who that would be.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.560]   I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm saying old.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.160]   Who could you be thinking?
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.160]   Let's see.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.680]   We're going to get to our tips in just a second and our wines of the week or wish list
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   as Jeff prefers because he's a positive, positive guy.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.200]   But before we do that, I do want to talk a little bit about backing up your data.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.160]   This is we haven't talked about Windows 7.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.800]   Anybody want to say anything about Windows 7?
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.360]   Oh, I got a coffee.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.360]   I got a coffee.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.360]   I bought a coffee.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.360]   It was exciting.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   I went into fries.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   Look, he's got a little bag.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.200]   We got to get into the fries.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:27.360]   I had time to go do some shopping and I walked in and I had to ask somebody where it was.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.360]   Oh geez.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.120]   And we really surprised me because I thought this is this big huge rollout, right?
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.800]   And I expected a huge kiosk and I could hear them making announcements.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.480]   I've come see the new demo and everything.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.760]   So I thought it must have been a big failure.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.040]   But then I actually found somebody and he showed me where it was.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.400]   He said they've been flying off the shelf.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.160]   We had a party on Thursday.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.400]   We had a Windows 7 house party.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   It's streamers.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   It's something I've talked about.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.720]   We even have a puzzle here that we had a race between because they kindly included a jigsaw
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   puzzle.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   I can't really pick it up.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.720]   It'll fall apart.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.200]   But they kindly included a Windows 7 jigsaw puzzle and we had a race to see if we could
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.880]   finish the puzzle faster than the install.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.200]   And we did.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.680]   So that was fun.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.000]   That's the activities they were talking about.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.440]   I've got an old Windows Vista laptop that's just been sitting behind me for about a year
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.440]   and a half.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.560]   So I thought maybe I'll get some use out of it now because it wasn't with Vista.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.600]   I really like it actually.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.880]   I really like it.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.280]   The most of the reason I want Windows is so I could run Chrome for crying out loud.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.920]   Although I guess we're getting Mac Chrome sometimes.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   I'm saying.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.720]   The Deaf version is pretty good.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.840]   Is that Chromium or is that something else?
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.640]   It's something else.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.160]   Chromium is from the world.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:43.920]   It's a Chromium build for the Mac which is available now.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.120]   And I could be wrong, but I think that they fork the official releases of Chrome off of
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.360]   the Chromium project.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.160]   And just somebody on Twitter just corrected me.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.360]   Mike, Chellen, thank you.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.960]   There is code available for Raindrop.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:55.960]   It's preliminary code.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:01.320]   You have to check it out of a source code repository.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.960]   So it's the rock salt.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   One ice cream.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   Here's the rock salt.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.960]   But there is code available.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.600]   Is that what programmers say?
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   Here's the rock salt.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.160]   That's a matter how we said about my Twitter litter program.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.200]   He said, I hate it when I click on links and wind up on GitHub.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.760]   It's like saying one ice cream.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.560]   Here's the rock salt.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.200]   That's a good line.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.800]   So there's rock salt there for me to drop it.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   I love that.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.520]   They were really close to that Mac version.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.000]   And then now the Google and Apple hate each other.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.160]   It's probably a bit slower.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.160]   I haven't even long.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.160]   Didn't.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.040]   It wasn't Larry or-- oh no, Eric Schmidt was apologizing and saying how bad he felt
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.320]   that the Mac version was so far behind.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.320]   I feel really bad.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.320]   But don't worry.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:46.600]   They'll be a version for solo-esque.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   How hard could it be?
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   Come on.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   How hard could it be?
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.800]   Apparently more than a year's worth of hard.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.800]   How?
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.800]   I don't get it.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.800]   The web kit.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   The web kit.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.200]   It's really pretty stable.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.200]   The one that's available.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   It's pretty stable.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.720]   I'll be using it with Wave on my Mac.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.040]   And it's got a couple of little things.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.720]   It's going to need to be fixed, but it's pretty good right now.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.560]   Oh, I've been using it.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:06.560]   It's fine.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.800]   I just don't get it.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:14.080]   Well, anyway, that's why I wanted Windows 7 so I could run Chrome.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.840]   And I wanted Chrome so I could run Wave.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.760]   And now I have no idea why I wanted Wave.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to Windows 7, you know the most important thing
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.720]   to do is to back up.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   You got it.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:28.720]   Back up first.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.320]   Anytime you're upgrading or making a change, you are backing up.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.640]   Of course, you're backing up all the time.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.720]   You wouldn't dream of having a computer.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.720]   What?
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   You're not always.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.720]   Oh my goodness.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.160]   We've got to do something about that.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.240]   It's time to get yourself a copy of Carbonite.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.800]   Carbonite.com.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.120]   It's backup done right.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.760]   And I'll tell you why it does it automatically so you don't have to think about it.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.440]   It's one of the problems with backup.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.880]   There's two that I can see.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.040]   One is nobody does it.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.880]   You just because it's a pain so you forget so you don't do it.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.120]   So Carbonite handles that by just doing it in the background all the time.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:06.200]   Once you install Carbonite, identify those precious files, the emails, the photos, the
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.600]   music, the things you can't afford to lose.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   He just says, "Okay, fine.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.280]   I'll take it from here."
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.600]   It backs it up.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   Backs it up to the cloud.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   See, that's the second problem.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.320]   The second problem is people might be backing up but they back up to a hard drive right
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.560]   next to their computer.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.800]   What happens if the worst happens?
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:22.040]   A fire, a flood, a tornado, and your house blows over.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.720]   It goes to Kansas and then you've lost a backup the same as you've lost your computer.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.520]   That's no good.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.120]   To have a backup, a true backup, you need to get it off site.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.880]   You need to get it away from the originals.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   Carbonite does that.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:39.160]   It uploads your backups and encrypts them with a 128-bit DES.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.920]   No, AES, I'm sorry, encrypts them.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.960]   Then using SSL so it's encrypted again, it sends it up to the Carbonite servers where
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.240]   it stays safe and sound until you need it.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.640]   You can access it anytime from any computer by logging into your Carbonite account or
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.840]   if it's time for a restore, you just a couple clicks of the mouse and boom, you download
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   that file.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.840]   Now here's the best part.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.480]   It backs up all these files, the photo, the music, the emails, the financial records,
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.360]   the office documents.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:09.600]   It backs an unlimited amount for less than $5 a month.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.440]   For $54.95 a year, backup as much as you want.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.560]   As long as it's on your computer, you can back it up.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.080]   There's no second tier or anything.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.200]   Mac and PC try it free right now.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:27.560]   Go to carbonite.com/carbonite.com/carbonit.com and use a coupon code TWIT.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.720]   Now here's what's going to happen, by the way.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.440]   I want you to sign up for the free trial.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.000]   Even if you know you want this, I'm fix that coupon code.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.360]   I have the wrong one there.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.000]   Even if you know you want this, I want you to sign up for the free trial because even
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.840]   if you use a free trial for just one or two days, when you then sign up for Carbonite,
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.880]   you'll get two months free.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880]   It's worth it.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.640]   I mean, it's always a good idea to try it, make sure it works, make sure you understand
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.640]   how it works.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   You're comfortable with it.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.640]   There's no cost.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.600]   You don't even need a credit card.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.280]   It does require an Intel Mac.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.320]   I know I get emails sometimes people say, "I have an old power PC Mac.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.480]   I won't work on that."
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.160]   It does work on all the Intel Macs and it also works on Windows.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.160]   You're going to love it.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.040]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.480]   Carbonite is backup done right.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.200]   We do a little thing, Danny, every week.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.080]   Gina has a tip.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.080]   Jeff has a number.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.480]   I have a tool.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.960]   And then we get our wish lists.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:31.080]   Anything you wish for, having to do with the cloud, it's not like a puppy or something.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.200]   So we'll get to that and we'll give you a chance to have your wish.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.680]   But let's start with Gina's tool of the week.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   My tip this week is a new feature that rolled out in Google Reader, which is pretty cool.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.920]   If you click on any subscription or any folder full of subscriptions, you can now sort it
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:53.760]   by, I think from the folder settings button, choose the sort by magic option.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.760]   I love magic.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   I love magic.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.200]   Yeah, I love magic.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.680]   Who doesn't love magic?
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.480]   You can sort by newest or by oldest and then you can sort by magic.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.200]   And magic is Google's algorithm takes Google Reader, Traxure, Behavior and what items you've
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.960]   been looking at and what items you like and which items you share and comment on.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.720]   It takes that data and tries to figure out what items would be most interesting to you.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.080]   So sort by magic.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.520]   It's kind of awesome because if you want to just hit your feed reader for just a few
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.160]   minutes and just see what the most important stuff, and in fact, I tried it this week and
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.960]   I tried it earlier today when I was researching stories for this show.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960]   And it did really well.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.920]   It suggested items that I was certainly interested in.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.920]   Now, in the blog post, they said that this data is based on the things that you share
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.240]   and like in Google Reader.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.920]   So if you're using those options, which I am, you'll get better data.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.760]   So I don't think it's just what you look at.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.800]   But it's a lot like Flickr's interestingness on photos except it's based on your behavior,
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.880]   not what other people have done.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.040]   But I think it might even look at what your things that your friends have liked as well
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.560]   in Reader, but it's pretty cool.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560]   It is indeed magic.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.560]   It was good for me.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.400]   I'd be interested to see Leo what you think if it turns up interesting items for you if
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   you give it a try.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.120]   So show me how to do this again.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.320]   I'm going to go to where?
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.480]   Click on a folder or click on any subscription.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.640]   And then in the folder settings button at the top.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   OK.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.840]   I can say sort by newest, oldest, sort by magic.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.080]   And it somehow knows that this--
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   Yeah, re-orders.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.240]   It's what I would be most interested in.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.400]   Yeah, in terms of what you might think is relevant.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.120]   Google Chrome themes video uses some YouTube magic to make a lasting impression.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.040]   See, I would be interested in that.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.040]   Look at that.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040]   There you go.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   There you go.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.800]   We're pretty good too.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.000]   Wow, that's neat.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.640]   It works really well in folders especially, I think, when you have lots of subscriptions.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:52.160]   I use-- you know, there's two different services, FeedHub and 8 RSS that will give me kind
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:59.160]   of a hot stuff, you know, hot articles based on the number of clicks and so forth.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:05.520]   Like here's my 8 RSS top stories in Japan, nerds control girls with joysticks.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.200]   So that's the newest.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   Let's sort by magic.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   I think that's--
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200]   That's what it knows about you, though.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.600]   Now, top 10 entrepreneurs to watch.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   See, that's neat.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   That's really cool.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   I don't know why.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.440]   So Gina, is this dare I say it one more time and get more trouble?
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.600]   This feeds into what we're talking about with Raindrop and the algorithmic guessing
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.600]   and the news stream, right?
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.240]   Yeah, I mean, I honestly hadn't made the connection, but yeah, it is.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.840]   It's based on your behavior and what you've expressed interest about at your gestures
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.280]   with on data, it's making suggestions, smart suggestions.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:41.680]   It's an ultimate Google wish for the world is to know your intent.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680]   Right.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   Right.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680]   So they can sell it.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680]   Exactly.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.680]   One doesn't like the more than 10 people can do that.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.720]   So they can sell it.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.080]   If I knew you intended to buy a Ford F-150 pickup, I'd be rich.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.120]   And now our number of the week for Mr. Jeff Rajarvis.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120]   Two million.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.760]   I found it interesting that that's the number of businesses Google bragged on.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.280]   It's official blog are now using Google apps in the enterprise with 20 million users,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.080]   100 countries, 40 languages.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   Okay, I got the sales.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.600]   But what really interested me was that they then have a commercial.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.000]   We don't see commercials from Google.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.440]   Yahoo spends $200 million to put commercials up.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.800]   Google and commercial's up.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.920]   They have a new commercial campaign called Go Google that they're putting in airports
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   and all around.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.880]   I've seen billboards in Silicon Valley.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.880]   Exactly.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.440]   They're bragging about all the companies that are going apps.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.680]   And so then it all made sense because a few days later I saw a link.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.160]   Eric Schmidt says that enterprise is the next big opportunity for Google.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.640]   And it's going to be a different business model that they don't think that ad supported
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.080]   enterprise stuff will work terribly well.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.360]   And so they're going to charge people for stuff.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.320]   And their price point is lower than everybody else's.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.320]   Like guess who?
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:53.000]   And so Google's now starting the pitch into enterprise saying that they already have
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.720]   a huge base of 2 million enterprises to begin.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.200]   And they're trying to get Google apps primarily right in there.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.560]   That's the, yeah, that's the wedge anyway.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:05.040]   And that ties into my tool of the week, which is something Gina and I have talked about
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.040]   before.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.400]   In fact, when we first talked about this show, she said, "Okay, it could be about Google,
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.520]   but make sure it's about cloud so I could talk about Zoho apps."
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.040]   And Zoho apps are fantastic.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.480]   And now even more Googly.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.080]   This is basically like Google apps on steroids.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.520]   I mean, they have the basic apps, but they also have, you know, wiki.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   67 more.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   Is it that how many?
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   No, no.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.520]   It just goes on and on.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520]   There's CRM.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.280]   There's online web conferencing.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.760]   There's invoicing project management.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.920]   I mean, it just goes on.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.440]   And this is the new feature.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.800]   You can use your Google apps login to.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:46.720]   So if you have one of those corporate Google apps accounts, you can integrate this in,
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.040]   even import and export share Google apps documents.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.440]   So it really is nice to have that kind of interface to Zoho.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.480]   Now, when you have a choice, Gina, do you, will you choose sometimes to use Zoho office
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   instead of Google?
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:07.480]   You know, I haven't switched to Zoho just because of just like inertia, momentum, you
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.200]   know, just, I've just used to using Google tools.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.120]   But every time I look at Zoho, which is pretty often because they're often rolling out new
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.760]   stuff and they send, they send us press releases at Life Hacker.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.080]   I look at it and go, this is, this is just great.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.320]   I mean, it's just a matter of like habit and what I'm used to.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.880]   And you know, just wanted to kind of keep up with what Google's doing.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.040]   So I haven't made the switch and I actually feel kind of ashamed to say that because it
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.560]   really is a fantastic product and now that they have the Google sign in for both the
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.600]   vanilla account and a Google apps account, it's really that, you know, they're doing
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.200]   everything, they can the lower the barriers for people.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.480]   I thought maybe this would be a fun thing to use for our business.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.840]   We use Google apps very heavily to share projects, ideas and so forth.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:49.320]   I thought because of the integration, I could do this, I was able to set up a, a Twitch,
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:55.880]   you know, account with a Twitch logo and, and, you know, and share it and so forth and
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.360]   have shared email and stuff.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   So I think that there's for.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.560]   And how do you like it?
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.560]   It's very impressive.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.960]   You know, I have to say I'm kind of prejudiced towards Google because I know they're going
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   to be around.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.400]   Well, yeah, there's that.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.760]   You know, and I'm sure, I mean, Zoho has a financial model that, that makes a lot of
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.240]   sense and, you know, works really well.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   But and, you know, for instance, they don't have a project planner on Google.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.480]   So I'm using the project planner for some projects of ours.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.520]   Just, it makes sense, especially in the areas where Google doesn't have a tool.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.520]   Right.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.060]   Certainly worth taking a look at, especially as you say now that there's a Google login.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.360]   And finally, we'll wrap up with our wish lists.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.480]   Danny, have you thought of anything you wish would come true in the world of Google?
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.160]   Yeah, it's not so much from Google.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.240]   It's probably the newspapers that are poking at Google.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.120]   Like, I felt like this week we've reached this new low point in this debate when the
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.880]   walkery journal managing editor had suggested that Google was causing people to be promiscuous
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   online.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   Oh, great.
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.360]   Somehow, you know, we...
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:04.280]   You mean sexually promiscuous or news promiscuous?
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.280]   Niscuous, yes.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:06.280]   You know, sources.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280]   Oh, okay.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.320]   We're being news sluts when we go to Google and we think that we can just...
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.800]   You ignorant news sluts.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   I know.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   Oh my God.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   I felt so dirty and...
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800]   Oh, that's horrible.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.640]   So... but no, but this was...
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:23.800]   I mean, it came up at the Web 2.0 conference and there were a number of slams like that.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:29.440]   And I just kind of felt like this was from the same person that was also saying that,
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.400]   you know, they felt like we needed to have a rational debate about professional journalism
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   where we go.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.920]   And I was thinking, yeah, I think that we could use rational debate or actually we could
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.400]   just use a more rational discussion of what solutions are.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:45.280]   And what I tend to hear from the industry poking at Google, it's just a lot of complaints
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.280]   and not a lot of solutions other than...
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.160]   One of them in my life, Danny.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.160]   This is why I live with every time.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:56.800]   It was a really great post you wrote in response to Robert Thompson and the journal and I tweeted
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   it and it was...
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.880]   Yeah, what you says.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.800]   Well, and thank you.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.320]   But, you know, I would love for you and I and everybody else to be able to get past
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.120]   having to debunk the charges and just start talking about the solutions.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.640]   One of the things is like, you know, I'm not a Google fanboy, I just like to have balance
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.600]   and when I watched that thing, I thought there was no balance and there wasn't anything
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.600]   reasonable.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600]   I...
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.560]   For the life of me, I still can't figure out what the Wall Street Journal seems to want
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.560]   because they had everything that...
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   Do you want to know that?
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.440]   I think I was talking to somebody who used to work with Google about Justice topic this
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.800]   week and I think the newspapers don't want a friend.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.520]   And it was Google's mistake to think that they could befriend them.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.560]   And instead the newspapers want someone to blame because they f-ed up.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.800]   They've had 15 years since commercial browser came up, out 15 years ago this month and they
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.800]   haven't done Jack because they protected their old world.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.480]   And I've been trying to work with them and, you know, I want to see them advance in the
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.320]   future and some people are getting smart and the New York Times is doing good things and
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320]   so on and so forth.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.440]   And Martin Nissenholz defended Google and said, "Welcome to competition."
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.080]   The executive of the New York Times was in charge of digital.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.080]   But you're right, Danny.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:10.280]   It's all it is, is whining and mewling and moaning and mourning and no constructive sense
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   of how to move forward.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.320]   Well, and so that's my wish.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.840]   I want that constructive thing.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   I want the specifics.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.240]   I don't want any more of the rhetoric.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.840]   I want to know exactly what it is that you want so that we can actually go forward because
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.000]   I think enough time has been weighted on the accusations that go.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.600]   And, you know, I'd like to see that.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.360]   I think there are things that can happen.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.760]   I think there are places where Google definitely needs to be called on and held up.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.640]   But when they do that, I want them to stand up when they do it.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.120]   And most of the time I just don't see this stuff standing up.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.720]   So I wish I could be more positive about that.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.720]   No, that's why I call it the wine, not the wish.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:45.720]   You're right.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.720]   If they can get the wine.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.720]   I'm going to let them know.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720]   All right, well, go ahead.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.640]   Any more time I'll come up with a wine against Google itself.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   No, that's fine.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.800]   I think that's a very good one.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.800]   That's a very good one.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.480]   I think that's appropriate.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.840]   Well, the good news half of this is that Google worked out a deal with Virgin to provide free
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.800]   Wi-Fi access on planes across the country.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.800]   That's the good news.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800]   Now my wine.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.320]   You just stop saying, gee, you won't believe it.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   I'm in an airplane and I'm online.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   Enough.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.320]   Enough.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320]   Enough tweets.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   We got it.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:23.280]   You won't believe where I'm calling from.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.680]   You can tweet from the air.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680]   We know it.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   Stop.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.080]   All right, I did it once in night.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.800]   It was about five years ago on SAS and I'll never do it again.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   I apologize.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   I think five years ago it was probably OK.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.760]   It was pretty unusual then.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:37.760]   It was unusual then.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.560]   I have yet to have Wi-Fi in a plane and when I do I will absolutely tweet that I'm going
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   to annoy Jeff.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.600]   I'm on a plane.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.080]   Not you.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:55.320]   How long before Saturday Night Live does a parody song I'm on a plane?
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   I wonder whether those pilots were too busy tweeting this one.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.720]   They missed their destination this week.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.720]   What happened?
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.720]   They over-sailed it.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.720]   What happened?
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.720]   150 miles.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   Oops.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   Oops.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.400]   You know, air traffic controllers think all pilots are idiots.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.720]   They just wish they'd leave it on autopilot the whole way.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.800]   Just let us bring you in.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.240]   I talked to a pilot when I was on Emirates flying to Dubai as a fan.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.760]   Hi, Bruno.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.560]   And he told me he was really interesting.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.680]   He flies the A380, which is the big Airbus.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:32.360]   And he said it's fly by wire.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.280]   In the old days you'd feel the rotors.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   You'd feel movement.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280]   You'd feel shake.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.240]   And of course they simulate that so that you know what's going on with the plane.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.440]   But really it's joystick.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.440]   It's electronic.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.440]   There's no feedback.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.240]   There's no force feedback from the actual wing.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.640]   And United pilots complained.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.800]   I think it was on the 777.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.520]   They complained because they didn't have to do trim anymore.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.920]   The plane trimmed did all the trim.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:03.240]   So Boeing in order to continue to sell airplanes to United put a fake trim button on the joystick.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.480]   It doesn't do anything but you have to press it.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.320]   And Bruno says all the pilots, all the rest of the pilots hate the United pilots because
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.640]   they're such old farts.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.080]   They needed a trim button.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.240]   And now everybody's got to press the button even though it does nothing.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.440]   You know, the whole autopilot thing, that's where automation scares me.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.600]   You know, it's like when the guy who's flying me from San Diego to New York is just kind
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.720]   of sitting there, you know, watching things happen automatically, that makes me nervous.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.640]   I want him or her to be a lot more engaged.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.840]   Well, Bruno listens to all our podcasts because he says there's nothing to do.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.200]   He says, yeah, yeah, a friend of mine is a pilot.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.640]   Yeah, she says the same thing.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:47.920]   It's amazing and does a better job, I think in most cases than the pilot would frightening.
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.280]   It's only a matter of time.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.200]   You know, already cars in the Prius has this avoidance detection.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.800]   If you if you if you veer out of your lane, it tightens your seatbelt improves the breaking
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.600]   of beeps at you.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.440]   It's just a matter of time before they drive themselves.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.880]   Gina, do you have a wish list item?
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.680]   My wish I'm going to I'm going to shamelessly steal Danny's idea and based on raindrop and
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.240]   the greeter sort by magic, I want a sort by magic button in my Gmail.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.080]   So that your mom's mail always goes to the top, right?
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   Yep, exactly.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.360]   Because I miss mom's mail all the time.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.360]   Mm hmm.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360]   Good thinking.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.720]   I think everything by magic.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.720]   Everything.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.120]   We should have magic every everywhere.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.120]   Except my planes.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.120]   Yeah, that's a little different.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.120]   We need to fly by magic.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120]   Everything by magic.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.120]   Say again?
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.120]   What?
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.160]   We just need a button that will automatically make everything automatically by magic.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160]   We had a button for that.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160]   So we'll get to it.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.720]   Yeah, just one button that does it all.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   I don't know.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.080]   My only wish is that the droid phone comes out soon because I can't wait to get my hands
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.880]   on one of them.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:54.080]   I, you know, I really hope that developers will not abandon Android.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.400]   I know that, you know, upset them when Google shut down the third party ROMs.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   But I think it's our last best hope to providing some competition to the Apple store.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.360]   My concern though is, you know, I was with Verizon for a long time.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.840]   When I lived, I lived in the UK and I lived in the U.S. and I had two phones.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.440]   And I had a phone in the UK that would have been perfectly fine to use on Verizon if it
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.120]   could have taken a SIM card, but there's CDMA and there's GSM.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:25.840]   So I want to, if that phone comes out, the one thing it probably don't do is let me take
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.960]   it to another provider down the line if I want to.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.840]   I'm going to buy this phone that's going to be a brick if I ever decide to leave Verizon.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.480]   And the reality is, you know, every year or so I'm dumping my phone sadly anyway, right?
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.200]   But still, is it going to let me work on a GSM network if I wanted to?
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:49.160]   The phone handset is the Motorola Sholes and there is a GSM, UMTS version of the Sholes.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.000]   So that's an interesting question.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.800]   I mean, Verizon may not sell it to you, but there will be a, that Motorola phone will
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.040]   be a, there will be a world edition.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.920]   You know, Verizon does sell some phones that have, you know, both GSM and CDMA.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.000]   They need, they need to do that.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.280]   It's a real problem for Verizon and Sprint customers is they can't travel.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.880]   They're kind of just stuck.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   You may not leave.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.720]   Hey, Danny, it's been really great having you.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.200]   And please come back and join us again.

[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.800]   I'm not going to touch that guy.

[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   I did it.
