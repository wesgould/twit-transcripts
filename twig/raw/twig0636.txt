[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Coming up on this week in Google, it's me, Jason Howell, filling in for Leo. Don't worry. He'll be back next week.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.560]   Also joining me, Stacey Higginbotham, Jeff Jarvis and Ant Pruitt. We talk about how Facebook is now meta and squirrel.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.120]   Also, Ant shares his views on the Pixel 6 Pro and specifically about the photo capabilities of the device.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.160]   Zillow is apparently bailing on flipping houses and TikToks seems to know why.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.640]   Email celebrates its 50th birthday and is it better to buy or lease electric vehicles?
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.160]   We try to explain that and so much more next on this week in Google.

[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. I'm Jason Howell returning for the last of two weeks in a row.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   Leo is, I think, honest way back at this point. I think maybe either he gets back from Mexico today or tomorrow.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   But not back in time to talk about all things Google and let's be real. All things meta, which we're going to talk about today.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Joining us today, of course, the return of Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   It's great to have you back to Stacey.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   I'm glad to be back. Thanks, y'all.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   Yeah, it's good to see you. Welcome back. We kept the seat warm for you.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   So you can give us all of your thoughts on what Zuckerberg had to say last week.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   And maybe some Google as well. I don't know. Just maybe.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   Also joining us, Jeff Jarvis, the Leonard Tau Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   Do we play the song every time now or do we just...
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   I don't know. I don't know. I'm proud in CrowdStrike and that's the concept.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   Or we could jump to go. Or we could play a random piece of audio.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   There we go.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   Graduate school of journalism at the city, University of New York.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   Oh, Stacey hasn't heard this. That's right. I haven't heard it.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   That was so awesome.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   Okay, I'm so sorry to finish your intro.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   No, no, no. You need to soak it in, right?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   We were all here last week to kind of soak in the barbershop for Ted.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   I just... Glorious. It was glorious.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   Okay.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   So Jason, Jason, just a friendly note here. You've got a little dirt on your chin.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   You might want to wash that off.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   Oh, yeah. I'll work on that the entire episode.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   I'll be reaching up there trying to dust that off and realize, no, it's stuck to my face forever.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Not forever. I guess I can shave it off. And I probably will at the end of this month.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Also joining us, I'm going to go ahead and deflect and move on from that kind of...
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Yeah, I know you're there.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   That's okay, Shaggy.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   So weeks, also joining us.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   And Pruitt, how's it going, Ann?
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   Unbelievable, sir. How are you?
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   All I can say is bless your heart when I look at this beard.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   I'm gonna say that when you said it with air quotes.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   I heard the quotes.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Okay.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   I'm not close to you there.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   I'm like bearded people. We reject you, sir.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   I know, right?
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Look, a boy's got to become a man sometime.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   Oh, man.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   I can go grab hard-head to the tenth grade hard-head and bring him in here.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   And he's got pretty much what I have on his face in comparing to you.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   I'm telling you, I knew it was going to be like this.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   My dad is the same way. And I do think that this is, you know, it's genetics.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   I would guess anyways. I guess I don't know that for sure.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   But my dad, he never grew out of the hair on his face because he always told me,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   "Oh, yeah, it doesn't know that it grows."
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   And then I think my grandpa as well. So this is just a how old...
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   Have you ever tried before?
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   No, this is my first time ever letting it grow out.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   I mean, outside of like, you know, we go camping and like for four days,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   I'm not shaving because we're camping or something.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   That's it.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   Wow.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   So it's an experiment as well as a fundraiser, you know, which I could talk about that later.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   I just apologize.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   Yeah, I was like, do you want to explain to people why you're doing this?
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   Yeah, you might as well put the plug in.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   I might as well go ahead and put it in.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   I'm basically, I'm doing it if you've ever heard of Movember.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   It's a way to raise awareness for men's health and mental health.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   And so, yeah, through the month of November, you let your facial hair grow out,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   however much or however little you have.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   And it's a way to kind of get some attention around the cause,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   raising funds for these causes.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   So if you go...
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   Actually, if you go to my Twitter profile at Jason Howell,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   my pinned tweet is a link to it.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   But you can also go to movember.com/m/JasonHowellTwit.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   And yeah, if you want to donate a little to help me get up to my goal, that would be amazing.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   But, you know, it's really, it's a twofold.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   It's a two-pronged thing that I'm doing.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   So you have more of two hairs, Jason.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   You have more than two fogs.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   I don't know, there might be maybe 50, maybe 100 hairs down here.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   I'm also very, very proud that my wife has not given me more crap about it than she already has.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   So, at least there's...
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   So, Jason, when you do go to the metaverse, will you make your avatar have a full beard?
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   Sometimes when I'm in VR, yeah, I do.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   I do not appear.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   It's the only way that I can do it.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   Sorry, Jason.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   That's all right.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   I think that's a good segue way for where we know we're heading at the very start of this show.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   So, let's remind everybody, because last week you said it, and we all resonated with you,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   you said it on Twitter again, how sick you were of talking about Facebook.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   And here, damn it, we've got to talk about Facebook again.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   I mean, which is partially because...
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   I mean, mainly, it's because, like, as I looked through all the news for this week,
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   it's really the only thing that stands out as, like, the most notable thing from the last week
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   is the fact that Facebook really kind of rebranded itself.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   There were hints that it was going to happen, and ultimately, it happened during the connect event.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   Zuckerberg had a whole long spiel, like, an hour long talking about the metaverse
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   and kind of ended things with the name change.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   Meta is...
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   I don't know.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   Is this basically the same thing as the alphabet holding company of Google thing?
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400]   That's how I looked at it.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   I don't see it as some sort of rebranding the way we look at the likes of Federal Express is now fed it.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   It's now FedEx.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   I mean, they didn't change a thing.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   I believe with them going from Google to Alphabet, people still talk Google, this week in Google.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   Yeah, I've seen it coverage all over, now calls it meta.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   I've seen a lot of meta out there.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   Whereas I've seen...
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   If they write your right answer, everybody says no, that's Google.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   I've still seen journalists write Alphabet and things like that when it comes to official
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   documentation or whatever, but when it comes to just general discussion, people say Google.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   I don't think this is going to change in any way for meta versus Facebook.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   Well...
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   It may be the metaverse expands.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   I mean, right now, Facebook is just Facebook.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   People even...
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   We use...
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   In the media, they use Instagram and WhatsApp kind of not interchangeably when we talk about
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.560]   the apps, but when we talk about Facebook and Facebook's harms, you know, you kind of...
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.520]   We don't always need a distinction between the different products.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.960]   So if meta...
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.400]   The metaverse is a thing, then maybe we will call it meta more often.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:03.520]   If the metaverse will be a thing, after watching Zuckerberg, I'm more dubious than ever.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   I don't think his metaverse will be a thing.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.360]   I do think we are going to have a real AR experience that then grabs it.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   It gradually goes into VR.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.760]   I think it'll be time consuming.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.040]   I think we don't know the kind of apps that will drive us into VR for good.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.240]   I don't think gaming is a strong enough pull.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.480]   So that'll be interesting.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.040]   Work, virtual work is certainly something that has a strong enough pull to bring us all into
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.480]   the metaverse, but in that case, I would look more at what Microsoft announced...
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   Was it yesterday?
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.960]   Two days ago?
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.360]   But their version, which is less, will connect various metaverses, which I did say would
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.280]   happen.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.200]   And maybe it's Slack that will deliver your Zoom that delivers your metaverse.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.880]   So did you all watch the video?
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.080]   I didn't see the whole...
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   I didn't see Zuckerberg's ones.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.240]   I wasn't interested in it.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.720]   I purposely tried it wrong.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.480]   I know that, but it's a traffic accident you had to watch.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   Oh, really?
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   It was all right.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480]   I'm like...
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   I only watched half of it, but it was...
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.360]   I was Slackjawed through the entire thing.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.640]   The effort to have these little in-jokes like, "Gee, what should I wear?
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.400]   Oh, said the guy I always wear."
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.680]   It's cute, but you could tell...
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.400]   You had a staff of 20 writers to come up with that moment, but it was...
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.640]   Yeah, I was Slackjawed.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640]   It was amazing.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:41.080]   Ms. Stacy, you mentioned what Microsoft is doing and how to try to tie this in from a
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.960]   corporate standpoint.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:49.480]   My question is why even have these VR spaces for work?
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:55.320]   There's a lot of complaints about just general health and people sitting at desk all the
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.480]   time and staring at the camera for their virtual meetings and whatnot.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:09.640]   What exactly is the advantage of having a VR meeting to talk about stuff on the TPS
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   reports?
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   That's a very good question.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.600]   I'm so glad you asked it.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.880]   I think I would hope we would get a more sophisticated vision of meetings.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.200]   I think we're in the midst of this now with everyone being remote.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.440]   So as a remote worker since 2004, I can tell you that I have had all kinds of questions
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.240]   and all kinds of meeting experiences and some meetings can be a phone call or on a
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240]   polycom.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.640]   Some meetings go great over soon.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.000]   I think there are things like collaboration and if you think about designing hardware
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.400]   or even working with someone collaboratively on building a PowerPoint could be better done
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   in VR.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:01.080]   So I don't think every experience should be in VR, especially for work.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:09.280]   I think conferences in VR become more interesting just because it allows you to communicate
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.640]   and kind of meander around in settings in a slightly less awkward way than some of the
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.560]   current options that are available to us.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:27.880]   So I view VR is not an everyday work thing, especially in the near term, but as a set
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:34.000]   aside chunk of time that you would use for a project, if that makes sense.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.600]   But I could be really, really, really, really wrong and we could just be in VR all day and
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.400]   that would be like a frickin' nightmare.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.200]   Oh god, that would be horrible.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.600]   I thought about that.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.480]   And don't get me wrong, I enjoy my experiences with VR.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:56.880]   They're very much confined to an hour here and an hour there and shared experiences with
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   my kids.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.600]   Spending all day working inside of a metaverse, which is kind of one of the questions that
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.840]   I had out of this, is do we understand what a metaverse is any better now that Facebook
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.560]   has gone all in on this?
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.200]   And if it's so far out in the future, why now?
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:22.360]   Why is now the time for Facebook to make such a significant dedication or devotion to this
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.080]   futuristic unit and it does feel like a lot of deflection, right?
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.160]   There's a lot of people saying this is deflection.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.640]   Do you believe that, Jeff?
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.240]   To an extent.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:38.160]   I think that, yes, I think the timing and the naming and all that seems convenient.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.040]   But no, I do think there is a sincerity.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   It has been for a long time.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   I mean, they bought Oculus.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   They care about this stuff.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   They want to try to believe it's there.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.720]   They keep believing in their some future.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.200]   They've got it in their heads.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.960]   And they did say some things that were actually good, that they understood the necessity of
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.720]   interoperability and taking your personality and your stuff elsewhere.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.520]   And they started talking a little bit about principles, but then they didn't really ever
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.160]   go there.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   This is the time.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.560]   I mean, learn the lessons they should have learned, which they haven't learned.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.320]   This is the time to say, let's talk about what's required here.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.760]   And all we get is Facebook with avatars in terms of the impact.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.280]   And that's not so good.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.200]   So I was disappointed by that.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.480]   So no, I think they're sincere, but I agree with you, Jason.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.520]   I still don't understand what the better versus even though Leo explained it to me.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.720]   I don't really see, I agree with Stacy that I think that I'm not a gamer.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.360]   I really can't get it.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:42.520]   So I imagine the value in a meeting maybe, but I'm not really sure how it beats soon and
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   not having to commute.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.800]   Imagine the show in the metaverse.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.920]   So anybody in the audience, like on the discord or the IRC or maybe I'll charge people money
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.560]   to get into the VR version.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.560]   I don't know.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.400]   So we're all sitting there together and I could actually virtually punch Leo or when
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.520]   we all interrupt each other.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.480]   You know, I could actually raise my hand and because I'd be out of the corner of your eye,
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.120]   you'd see it and you'd be like, oh crap, I can't interrupt Stacy.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120]   That would be horrible.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.120]   Right.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   Right.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.920]   But again, that's entertainment, Miss Stacy.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   Why?
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.920]   Is it utility?
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   Why are we entertaining people?
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   Right.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   Not on purpose.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   Okay.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   It's a job.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   It's quasi in from information.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   Okay.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   But in immediate, it's the same thing.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   Like as someone who is terrified of being an aggressive female, I'm constantly in meetings,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   but also someone who's chatty and feels like I'm a know it all.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.920]   I'm constantly blowing over people to talk about things that I know about meetings and
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   it would be nice to have more social cues.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.920]   Something.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   I look at this is old.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   Daniel Suarez is demon in D space.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.640]   The way he described it, it sort of reminds me of Google Glass where people were wearing
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.720]   these little sports goggles or whatever and it had an HUD in it.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.760]   And sure, the way he described it is they had these thicker, thicker arms on them.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.320]   So there's battery and communication and stuff like that.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.440]   But it didn't look intrusive.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.480]   It just looked like regular people walking around with sports glasses, even though they
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.440]   did have this AR overlay.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.880]   I think something like that would be awesome to have, but then there is also some privacy
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.320]   implications because they could look at people's credit scores or D space score and things
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   like that.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.840]   And you have to worry about all that.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.680]   And then you have to look at the infrastructure, who's going to manage all the infrastructure
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.040]   and battery life or you're going to care about battery packs.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.720]   And it's a lot tied to it.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.920]   So this whole metaverse thing, I just don't think it working as day to day life, but whatever,
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   prove your own Facebook.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.720]   I don't think this is near term.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.280]   I mean, yeah, this is far out.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   I feel like what happened here is, you know, you talk to any, any engineer, especially male
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.920]   engineers of a certain age, the metaverse has like where they freaking grew up, right?
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.960]   You know, child at the 80s, 90s.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   I find.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.400]   I don't think it's really, it's, yeah, they read about this.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.440]   They want, I don't want to get into what they want.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.080]   I don't know.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:30.640]   But you look at this like rich immersion entertainment and it makes sense to a lot of
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.120]   people, not everybody obviously to, I think the older you get in the more ingrained with
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.080]   real people, you get the less something like this makes sense, right?
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.720]   So, but I do think we are heading to a richer communication environment.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.480]   If that's going to be AR or full VR, I don't know.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.320]   I think VR for like entertainment and maybe meetings in the future.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.480]   But I do think we are, we are processing so much information through our phones.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:07.080]   I think having a system by which we can process information around us from the world through
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.400]   classes is a no brainer, right?
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.040]   It's where we are headed.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.920]   So if you say, okay, then I need very smart glasses that are portable, that I get better
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.160]   wireless, that is what we're building, right?
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.840]   And that's going to be super fast.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.040]   And we're going to have to think about what it means to have information about the people
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.560]   and the places.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.560]   How do you display it?
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560]   How do you store it?
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.400]   What do you display to certain people?
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:38.480]   What are the ethics of saying my name and age, you know, to everyone around me?
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.720]   To I don't know.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.800]   I mean, all of those things are things.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   We're going to be there.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   We're going to be there in like 10 years.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.040]   Now, the whole metaphor is I don't care.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.480]   You gave me the first use case that makes sense for me to see you so I don't do what
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.240]   I just did, which was interrupt because I was going on.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.000]   I could see that's all right.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.400]   And so I need those kinds of things.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.720]   The other thing was if you want to, if you play that video starting at about three minutes
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.240]   45, I'm curious for your reality check because they never really present what it's really
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   going to be.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.800]   It's some kind of loose thing.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.040]   And where there's a whole bunch of stuff going on that I don't think is I think because
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.880]   of its lack of realism, I mean lack of doable, of it being doable.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.640]   It doesn't really present what the vision could be.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.520]   And it makes it harder, I think, to develop it.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:45.600]   Is it more like a conceptual view, like what you would see it as CES when they bring
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600]   out all the products?
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   It's a concept product.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.160]   I was complaining about it.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.760]   I just went through the tape and if you go to about 350, you'll see from the one I have
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.760]   the rundown.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.760]   It's probably pulling it up now.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:08.600]   You'll see the mix of real person avatar, he's the AR person.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.360]   And I don't know how you mix those things in.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.760]   And I know I'm getting ahead of myself.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.360]   It was the reality, but I think we've got to speak in realistic terms if we're going
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.160]   to develop anything coming up.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.040]   Sorry, Jim, we're around like three three three.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.560]   It's about three 45 into that tape.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.560]   Three 45.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.880]   You're in the game room scene at the beginning of the tape.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   There you go.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.360]   Oh, the Pixar movie.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   Right.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.520]   So you've got a real person.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   That's Buzz.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.200]   Then you've got a hazy person.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.920]   And then you've got an avatar all mixed in together.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.640]   Those were the stars, Buzz.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.040]   And then you've got a video feed into it.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   Sure.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.920]   And you've got an interaction going on.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:21:01.480]   It's presuming that your tactile, this is a report of looking at AR art.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.600]   So now they're all flying around it within the better verse.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.680]   But the problem is this is a God's eye view of what it would be.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   It's not a me.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.440]   Even though I am God.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   A me.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.360]   You can tackle back and forth.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   Check out this.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.640]   Well, that's what I'm wondering.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.640]   That's what I just don't know.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.200]   I don't know how to judge this in reality.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.240]   Am I accessing this from my desk chair?
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.480]   Am I accessing this from the couch?
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.520]   You have to see this.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.840]   The bus station.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.560]   Or does everybody have a dedicated VR room for all this?
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.960]   You have to go through your own room to your own pocket.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   I need to connect.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   I don't mean to be literal.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.800]   I just mean to be what I understand about it.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.000]   Well, so I think easily in video games, you can switch a lot of times.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.680]   You toggle between a God view in a first person.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.680]   Right?
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.760]   So I feel like you probably could do that in VR if you wanted to.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.600]   You should be in the two.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600]   Yeah, I would imagine.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.440]   But if you spend time in VR, what you...
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.840]   I mean, yes, they have to show you the God view or they don't have to, but it makes sense
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.160]   that they're trying to.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:13.720]   When you spend time in VR, it does feel like you have the view that you normally have
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.160]   as a person and you can kind of feel it.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.560]   It's just like you're aware of things like out of the corner of your eye that you may
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.560]   have.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.400]   And when you make your natural gestures, you get more information.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.200]   So like when I'm like, "What was that?"
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.560]   I see it.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.880]   So I think it's actually an extra sensory perception if you think about it to be able to go to
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.920]   God view because then you see everything differently.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.120]   But I don't know how...
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:43.960]   So that's kind of an interesting user interaction kind of thing that you could think about.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.120]   If you're in a crowd of people, maybe you want to see the whole thing.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.120]   Yeah, and I'm trying to think of my experience with VR.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.480]   There was an article where was it?
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.440]   It was Washington Post that was kind of making a connection that Facebook is...
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.920]   Meta is not anywhere near the first company to actually do a lot of these things.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.800]   Roblox is a game that my kids play and granted it's not in VR.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.040]   But it's very similar in a lot of ways to what Facebook is talking about.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.840]   It's ever present avatar that follows you from experience to world to game.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.600]   And all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   SteamVR, VRChat, also Rec Room, Rec Room is a game that I've played on VR.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.920]   I love to play.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:35.120]   That has a lot of these familiar kind of touch points I'd say from what Zuckerberg was kind
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   of pointing out.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.920]   In none of those cases that I've experienced, do you have that actual God view mode that
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   I've experienced anyways?
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.120]   Maybe it's possible.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.400]   I just haven't experienced that.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.440]   It's always the first person kind of experience.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:57.200]   If you want some more humor from this, if you go to 1630, you see Zuckerberg on the
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   Metaphoil.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.800]   Oh, the hydrophoil?
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.200]   Yeah, the hydrophoil.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   So it's amusing.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.840]   But I think it goes on forever.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.760]   The whole thing is an hour and 20.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   So it was a long-- that's what I kind of found a little bit humorous is it was so long and
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.480]   it was almost entirely dedicated to the Metaphors.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.320]   And still at the end, I would have a hard time explaining this.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.880]   Here's the joke too.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.640]   He's trying to pick his outfit.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   Do I need some sunscreen?
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640]   I love it.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.560]   Yeah, his face is covered in the sunscreen.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   All right, back.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.640]   I love that he's less robotic in the Metaphors.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   I don't know if you'll notice that.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.960]   But I was like, wow, he has so much more fluid.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.560]   He's almost more human in the Metaphors than he is in real life.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.400]   He's like, oh.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.080]   I think what occurred to me by the end is that this idea-- like you're right, Stacey.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.680]   This is a long-term view.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:03.320]   But for the right now, this particular idea seems like a really niche market to hit your
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.840]   trillion-dollar company too.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.360]   Which could end up being a Metaphors/Facebook being just incredibly forward-thinking.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.080]   And 10 years from now, we're like, all right, they obviously realized something that we
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.440]   didn't back then.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.760]   But I don't know.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:27.440]   It's like Facebook decided this juggernaut that we've created, let's do Roblox instead.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.520]   And it just seems like a really interesting kind of direction to go for me.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   It's the Bitcoin of 2021.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.560]   Oh, what was that, Anne?
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.720]   Is it the Bitcoin of 2021?
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.880]   They're going in super early.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   No, no.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   I think this is a point of what's the word I'm looking for, continuation for all of the
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   Internet.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.920]   I put this in the chat, but I think it's fundamentally true.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:57.760]   We do things on the Internet initially, what drives us, what drives most of the killer
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.040]   apps is sharing and connecting with people.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.360]   Facebook, that is literally what they think they do.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.720]   They want to connect the whole world and share.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.880]   We can argue about how and what and blah blah blah.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:17.200]   But we are going to have, through VR, you do get a richer connection.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:25.040]   You do get to communicate more with your body, with other, more information comes through.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:30.760]   So think about it as the fidelity of the information that's available to us online has gotten richer
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:36.520]   and richer from email and static images to GIFs to FaceTime.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.280]   Can you hear my dog?
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.840]   Gailping is she snores?
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.160]   I was up it.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.600]   To the video.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.760]   To this type of video, Zoom things that we're having.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.440]   So it makes sense that we would do that for certain occasions and maybe as it gets lighter,
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.400]   wait, we'll do it more often.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   Nobody.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.360]   I mean, think how long video calling AT&T showed the first video phone in like 1960 something
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.680]   and we didn't start doing it until FaceTime.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:11.480]   So I just want to continue them.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.320]   Yeah, that's a really good point.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.560]   These things are not immediate.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.760]   It does take a long time for them to make themselves obvious, right?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   And it has a swirl value.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.640]   And yes, and I think that's the other thing.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.080]   And write down a major squirrel value.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.080]   Huge squirrel value.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.880]   You know the thing Mark always goes on about meetings?
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.320]   Let's do something around that.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.760]   This is a good time.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   Right.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.440]   It seems to work for us.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440]   Maybe it'll work for the world.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:45.320]   Well, I still think he's going to promote himself to be metagod and then somebody's going
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.200]   to be stuck with Facebook.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.320]   But I think that could be a good thing.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.080]   I think he'll do a larry in Sergei.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.240]   I still think that he'll still be.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.640]   Yes, he's still up controls his talk.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   Yes, he's still in charge.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.560]   No, it doesn't get rid of him for those of you who hate him.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.840]   But does it change his rules officially that someone could take responsibility in a different
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   way?
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   We'll see.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.920]   Yeah, if he still has veto power, I don't think it matters, right?
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:19.240]   Yeah, but if you look at how Google has advanced since larry in Sergei went elsewhere.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:25.440]   You could argue, Leo argues it got in dollar, but you really don't sense that they had
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.720]   their thumb on it.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.880]   That that was them doing the right thing.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   Would he?
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   I don't know.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   But I think it's possible.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.680]   I think it's possible that only the hugest issues would then come to him as opposed to
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.560]   part of the problem in the whole structure of the company right now is that so much comes
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   to him.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   Right.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:48.760]   And he makes such terrible decisions because I don't know if he's like, yeah, I just, I
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   don't know.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:57.600]   It'd be pretty, pretty tone deaf at times, to say the least.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.960]   All right.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.880]   Well, that's our, that's our metal block.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.560]   I mean, there were, there were other things that happened that connect things that they
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.360]   showed off, you know, VR headsets, Project Cambria and other things.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.080]   But is there anything that we need to touch on there before we take a break and move on
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   to other topics?
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.920]   The Cambria was like a, a, what do you call those cars that don't really exist?
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.560]   They show it to trade the frustrate me because you can't buy them.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   The concept car.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.640]   The concept car of headsets.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   Right.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.800]   So it doesn't exist yet.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   Fine.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   This is what we're working on.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.000]   I think the most interesting part to me was the guy at the end going through the technology
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.040]   of what they are working on and the, the discrete elements they have to build.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.800]   That was, that was geeky and interesting.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   Mm hmm.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   Otherwise, no.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   Agreed.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   Agreed.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   And scene.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   All right.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   Let's take a break.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.400]   Then we can hopefully talk about some Google in here.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.640]   I knew we had to start off with Facebook, but then we can go in whatever direction we
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   want.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.520]   And I never imagined that we, I never imagined that we'd possibly talk about Zillow on this
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.520]   show, but I think it's the intro.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   I've got to understand that.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.520]   Amazing story.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.760]   So we've got to talk about Zillow at some point, but let's take a break and thank you
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.320]   for the great, the sponsor of this episode of this week in Google.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.640]   And that is Udacity.

[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.240]   You've been sitting on the sidelines going, you know what?
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.440]   I want to get to autonomous vehicle, you know, creating autonomous vehicle systems.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.520]   Well, Udacity has a program for that.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   So we'll talk about that.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.240]   Udacity has specialized and exciting content that can help take you further in the career
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   that you want.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.840]   They also offer the latest cutting edge nanodegree programs talked about on this show specifically
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.080]   about nanodegree programs in previous years that you really, you can't find this anywhere
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   else.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.040]   Udacity is here to encourage your career growth and they want to provide you with the information
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.920]   about the career that you want.

[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.400]   And then hopefully that's going to help you get the job that you want.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.760]   Here are just a few Udacity success stories before we move on.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:25.520]   Jobin said Udacity armed me with skills to develop models and gave me an innovative experience
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.320]   with quick, high quality recurring feedback.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.800]   And then Aaron, Aaron's kind of like the true success story here, said Udacity's nanodegree
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.200]   programs and career resource center played an integral part in helping me land a job
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.960]   offer from Google, none other than Google.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.040]   You can check out one of Udacity's top five nanodegree programs.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.840]   That's data engineering, product manager, data analyst, data scientist, lots of data
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.040]   in here and programming for data science with Python.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.800]   If you didn't know data is hot right now, if you're looking to get into the most cutting
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.440]   edge technology careers, you can get nanodegree programs in AI, flying car and autonomous
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.840]   flight engineer.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.840]   There's intro to self driving cars, machine learning engineer, robotics software engineer,
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.520]   that would be fascinating and so much more.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.400]   Udacity's courses are created with partners and industry leaders in Microsoft, Google,

[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.760]   We thank Udacity for their support of this week in Google.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.760]   Okay.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.120]   So let's see here.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.160]   Well this is next in the agenda and I might as well just ask you about it now because I
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:21.240]   know and during last week's show, it was during the show that you got delivered your
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.440]   Pixel 6 Pro, right?
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   Yes, sir.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   Kids showed up right during the show.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.080]   I'm stuck in Illinois.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.720]   I'm so jealous.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.880]   And here it is.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   I got it.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   I was going to come to 7.1.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   I was going to come to 7.1.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.880]   I'm going to come to 7.1.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.880]   And it's a slippery phone.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   So I would agree it's a slippery phone.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.680]   Did you get a case?
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.680]   Yeah, I did.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:49.760]   I had the case delivered before the phone because Amazon, but I'm so glad I did.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.400]   This thing is just ridiculously slippery.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.720]   Yeah, no, it really does need a case.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.840]   I don't feel comfortable without a case on this phone for sure, but that's just standard
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   options.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.440]   You went with a clear case too?
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   Of course.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:07.960]   I mean, if you're going to put the phone in colors and stuff, what's the point of not
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   showing at all?
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.560]   So my recommendation, hold up, let's see if I can show you.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.520]   This was clear when I got it.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   Cool.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   Yeah, they do.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.120]   Wow, you start to fade like blue.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.960]   So you should clean your case or get a new one?
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.640]   I wonder if putting it through the dishwasher would work.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   Don't take my--
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   That's an idea.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.640]   Don't take that lightly.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.400]   I'll do it when I'm done with this one in the seat.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.000]   Yeah, see what happens.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.280]   So, OK, so you've had it for a week now, Ant.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.440]   What do you think?
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:46.600]   And I'm super interested in hearing your thoughts on the camera system, obviously, because that's
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   your bag.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.920]   But what do you think about the phone?
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.160]   The phone in general, I think it's totally fine and adequate from a speed standpoint.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.960]   That whole fingerprint reader that most people have been fussing about, yeah, it's a little
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.680]   work compared to the other phones I've had and some of the other phones that are out
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.000]   there, but it still works.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.920]   So I don't think it's that much of news or anything.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.720]   It's just half a second slower.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.440]   And does it really make that much of a difference in your day to day life that that fingerprint
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.160]   reader's half a second slower?
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.720]   But overall, I think this is a really, really slick piece of hardware.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.400]   Nice.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.160]   And have you put the cameras through any extra effort cases?
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.440]   Yeah, I have been playing with the cameras.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.200]   I still want to play more.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.960]   From the video standpoint, I haven't played too much because I was hoping it would have
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:46.160]   some sort of capability similar to what Apple has in its cinematic mode.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.720]   Yeah, I've seen it there.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.960]   So it's just another 4K 60 frames per second camera, whatever.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   But having the regular camera versus the telephoto camera on there, it's been a little
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.480]   bit interesting to me because it doesn't have any type of macro capability or anything
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   like that.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.120]   So I wanted to play around.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.720]   And let me see if I could share my screen.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:13.880]   I took some photos here recently, share my screen to there.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.240]   There we go.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:21.520]   Now this is JPEGs versus the raw files that you can get with it.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.920]   This here is a JPEG file.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:29.680]   When I say JPEG, that means after you snap the image, Google's AI in process and say,
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.360]   "Hey, this is what this picture is supposed to look like in the end."
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.800]   And I took it in fairly...
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.840]   This is in the middle of the day.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.880]   This was like at 1 o'clock, I believe.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.440]   Yeah, 1.12 PM.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.640]   So there's plenty of light outside.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.080]   But yet I'm looking at this image and there's a lot of grain and noise in the background
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.360]   and it just doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.960]   I shot it using the telephoto lens.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.960]   Excuse me.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.980]   I know you were saying that you had issues going from the regular lens to the telephoto
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.300]   lens like it just kept skipping and jumping back and forth.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.300]   I had her head that problem.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.300]   In situations.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.300]   Certainly.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.300]   Yeah, I haven't had that problem.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.740]   It just sort of locks in for me once I hit zoom.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:16.860]   The detail on this is not great, but it ain't horrible either.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:23.780]   But it just shows that whatever the AI processing on this image is sort of hit or miss because
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.340]   this is what the raw looks like.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.820]   As you can see up here in the upper left, it says DNG.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.020]   So that's a raw file.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.940]   That's no processing.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.860]   That's just what I did with my own camera controls and just hit the shutter.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.580]   And this looks much better.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.380]   And from a photography standpoint, this is a lot more flexible to work with and dial
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:48.980]   in the settings and make it look better, changing exposure and stuff like that.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.940]   There's plenty of data to play with and you get nice dynamic range and things like that.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.340]   Unfortunately, most regular people don't care about that.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.740]   Do they really understand why they would use it?
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.180]   You know, like, oh, the files are bigger.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.940]   Like I can store less photos on my phone.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.420]   You know, they're just not going to get there.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.420]   Right.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.340]   It's going to take some work to be able to pull this out and make it work for your Facebook
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.740]   or your Instagram or your Twitter or whatever.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.660]   But from a photographer standpoint, yeah, this is pretty good.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.420]   I enjoyed the flexibility.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:26.780]   I can even go in and just change the color of this green stem to be, you know, like a
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.020]   more of an older, dead dying.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.340]   Yeah, you really brought me down now, aunt.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.340]   You're killing it.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.740]   Oh, boy, if I want, but if I want to make it vibrant, I can make it even more vibrant.
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.740]   There we go.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.740]   I'm feeling bad.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.540]   You know, so the file has plenty of data to work with.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.820]   But again, that's not something the regular person is going to care about.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:53.460]   Now this one, this is another raw file and this one looks pretty good right out the gate.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.260]   I didn't save the JPEG, but the JPEG came out looking just as good as this one.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.900]   I don't really have to touch it.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:05.460]   But again, this is plenty of light outside with this smaller sensor than a regular camera
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.740]   and it's going to look pretty good.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.380]   Next I wanted to take a look at the actual zoom capabilities.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.340]   This is that tree way off in the distance over here in this scene.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.340]   Okay.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:24.340]   The zoom capability, I find you need to stop at about nine X.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.060]   You go more than that, you start to lose detail and it starts to look really, really
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.060]   fuzzy.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:35.860]   And this is raw as it says up here in the upper left, but this is just, I don't think
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.020]   that's usable.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.900]   I can play around with the exposure and make it look a little bit better, but from a detailed
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.420]   standpoint, no, it's just, it's just gone.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:51.100]   Do you encounter digital zoom that is in your estimation usable?
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:55.580]   Because I feel like anytime there's a digital zoom, I just, my eyes see the crunch and I'm
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.780]   like, I'm not going to go.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.780]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.780]   It is totally.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.100]   So that's why an optical zoom for me is like essential.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.740]   I need an optical zoom because I want to be able to zoom and I don't want to have to settle
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.420]   for that crunchiness.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.140]   It is so hard to find good zoom.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.100]   Like I said, I think the threshold is at about nine X on this phone.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.420]   I don't go any higher than that.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.740]   I actually have some pictures on Instagram.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.180]   I could switch that screen.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.620]   There we go.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.340]   I set up a macro shot and I set up three different things.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.980]   So this is using the one X zoom.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.980]   Okay.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:36.140]   And that's the four X optical and this is the nine X and this looks really good for nine
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.140]   X.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:43.500]   And even if I wanted to crop in, I got plenty of detail that are cropped in with nine X.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.740]   And then if I wanted to do some post process and I could bring it out even more.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:53.780]   So again, I think the sweet spot for this phone is to stop at about nine X or so.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.780]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.540]   And then nine X is probably going to work better on an object like that.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.940]   That's relatively close to you to begin with versus a nine X on a tree that's off in the
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.940]   distance side, right?
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.940]   Right.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.020]   Because that was so much closer so you could get much better focal focus on it.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.020]   Now this is Kylo.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:19.140]   Again, this is a JPEG that we're showing on the screen shot this in a less ideal situation
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:24.380]   here in the studio where it is a little dark because I want to control lighting, shot it
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.220]   where he was backlit.
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.580]   So that's a challenge for the camera.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.140]   And this one came out.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.140]   Okay.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:38.060]   It was able to give us some details in his face versus the raw file.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.060]   Catch my breath.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.220]   Ooh, versus a raw file.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.460]   This is what it normally would look like.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.660]   His face is really, really dark because it was backlit and the camera didn't really know
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.660]   what to do.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:54.740]   And if I wanted to play with it more, I can because it's got all of the data here to play
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.260]   with and make it look good.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.260]   Ooh, sorry.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.220]   I hate stairs in my eyes.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.220]   You're right.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.220]   I hate to touch this last one.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.220]   I hate ant.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.660]   You should add some cardio.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.300]   I hate cardio.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:17.540]   But getting back to that, the setup to get that macro shot, something that's critical
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:22.060]   is being able to have a tripod or something like this here.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.060]   This is a little glyph.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.580]   It's called a studio neat glyph.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:30.740]   I definitely need to have that locked down because when you zoom in, you get a lot of
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.860]   microshakes in your camera and it's just going to make it blurry.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.660]   So I was able to lock it down on the tripod and take those shots.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.660]   Let me see.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.780]   There we go.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.980]   This is what the setup looked like.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.420]   And I just stood up there and just tapped the screen to set the zoom to be able to get
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.060]   whatever zoom I wanted to use.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.300]   And of course, I'm using light that I can control.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:01.220]   But again, these are scenarios that regular people aren't really going to worry about.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.420]   No, most people are not going through this trouble to snap a shot.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.420]   It's not for wars.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   They're just carrying that phone.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.060]   No, absolutely not.
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.060]   But nice to know that the camera hardware is capable of creating good shots.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.740]   It's still that gum capable.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.220]   You know, if you have all of the tools around it.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:23.740]   And then lastly, I wanted to show more of a somewhat real world experience with it.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:28.620]   Granite, I did have one of my lights there in the garage to shoot this.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.220]   But this is a JPEG.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:34.220]   This is what Google says, hey, this is what our picture is supposed to look like.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.220]   Not raw.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.700]   Notice the skin tone we talked about.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:44.340]   They were doing a big push for real time for real tone for people of color.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.780]   This one looks, it's still a little bit green.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:54.740]   Because if you look over here in this histogram in the upper right corner, you can see there's
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.980]   a little bit of green pushing through there.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:02.940]   Even if I go to select my white balance, the white balance is going to say the same thing
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.940]   and it gets rid of that green.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.140]   And this is more so.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.780]   This is more so what the skin is supposed to look like.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.020]   But now, yes, as you said, it's blown out.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:16.740]   It's needed dial back that exposure just a little bit.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.340]   But detail wise, this is great.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.740]   Oh, your wife is going to hate you.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.740]   My God.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.740]   This is great.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:34.620]   She's seen this picture, you know, but this is coming from a phone and I could shoot this
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.660]   for anybody to, you know, present to their family as a portrait or what have you because
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.500]   it's really, really good quality.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.100]   And if I wanted to do some retouching on it or whatever, yeah, I can do that.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.100]   Let's see.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.940]   Like I can get rid of that little mark right here on her skin.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.940]   That's gone.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.780]   It's a little blemish there.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   That's gone.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.060]   And boom, we're good to go.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.900]   But this is all straight out of the head comes smartphone and yeah, pretty awesome.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.820]   Google not get out the part.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:06.820]   Nice.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.580]   Okay, there's the verdict.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.580]   There you go.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.980]   Now, okay, does it take phone calls?
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.060]   I hope not phone calls.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.540]   Who wants to do that, Stacy?
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.220]   It takes spam phone calls.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.860]   That's all I ever see.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.860]   It takes them and you don't answer them.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.140]   So because it warrants me.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.900]   I do appreciate Google for that.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.260]   I'm always like, who are these people joking about their car warranty?
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.860]   I've never had one of those on my Pixel.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.380]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:41.180]   So then Stacy and Jeff, you both have them en route at this point, right?
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.700]   When yours arriving, Stacy, any moment?
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:51.220]   It's pending because it's stuck in freaking someplace Iowa, St. Corso.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   Wow.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   11.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:57.620]   So as of October 27th, it's stopped moving.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.820]   It is just sitting there.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.460]   Oh, no, just staying.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.460]   I'm real sad.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.660]   So mine, I was going to get it.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.260]   I think late October, there's a 128.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.260]   I didn't want that.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.260]   I wanted 56.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.260]   So I reordered.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.260]   So then it was December 1.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.980]   Then four days ago, it was suddenly December 23, 24.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.540]   Now it's November 17, 18.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.540]   Oh, OK.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.580]   It's my mood as a result.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.020]   Yes, right.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.180]   Today's a good day.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.940]   Today's a bad day.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:35.580]   Yeah, this is all very much fluctuating.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:39.060]   Google actually has warned about this, the fact that there's going to be, you know, it's
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.420]   high demand.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:46.380]   There's all sorts of issues happening with shipping and keeping it in stock and, you
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.260]   know, long delivery times and everything.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.300]   So if you bought the 6 Pro, and I think the warning was specifically about the 6 Pro and
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.220]   not the regular 6.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.620]   I didn't get the Pro.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.940]   So you're on the regular 6.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:06.420]   I'm on the regular 6 and mine has it shipped on the 27th from Carol Stream, Illinois.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.420]   And that is where it is.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.420]   Right.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.460]   So it's like, is it an ingra microprocessor?
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:15.460]   They made the shipping label.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.740]   I don't know that it really shipped.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.740]   Until you see that.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.620]   Well, they say it's actually shit.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.540]   I know, but now I've learned that.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:29.500]   Like in the FedEx thing, it's usually pretty good about like, you know, do we have the
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.740]   label or yeah, it's a lie.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.740]   It's a lie.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.740]   I hate to tell you.
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.740]   It's supposed to be here today.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.020]   Oh, that's a bummer.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.020]   That's disappointing.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:47.140]   Hopefully I know I was like, oh, I can't wait to, you know, yeah, the show.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.980]   I have a question for you.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.340]   So as part and anyone, this is, oh, this is things you can instead of convincing Leo
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.700]   to buy something, you can convince me to take something free.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.260]   So you know, the Pixel Buds A series.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.220]   They're like, Hey, you get them for free.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.220]   Do you want to read it?
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.220]   I got them.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.220]   Just get them.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.220]   I like it.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.220]   I like it.
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.220]   It's a different set of earbuds.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.300]   Yeah, I know, but I'm very much against buying things I don't need or want.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.300]   I know, not buying it.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   I think it's more elegant design.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.300]   It's more comfortable.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.100]   I prefer them.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.100]   Yes.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.300]   Yeah, quite serviceable.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:32.260]   And I know that Jeff a while back, I think it was on Twitter where you and I had the
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.660]   back and forth that I may have convinced you to buy that the A series and afterwards,
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.580]   I was like, okay, well, I hope his experiences is as good as mine has been.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.580]   I know I'm still mad at you.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.220]   What matters for two reasons now.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:48.660]   What is it does have the occasional dropout, which what happens, I say Jason.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.660]   Oh, but not as many.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.660]   Not as often.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.660]   It's very rare.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.660]   It's very rare.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.660]   I will say that good.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:59.420]   But number two, now I have two sets of them because the other one just comes with the phone.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.220]   Now there's nothing I could have done about that, Jeff.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.500]   So you can't blame me for that one.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.220]   I'm still blaming you Jason.
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.220]   All right.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.980]   I've not experienced the dropouts with these that I have.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.660]   I mean, they've experienced with some other ones, but what I am experiencing, I believe,
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:19.180]   is more of an Android 12 problem where Bluetooth just toggles off randomly, just it's often
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:21.780]   and I'm listening to an audio.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.100]   I'm having all kinds of Android 12 issues.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.380]   Well, that's not true.
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:31.180]   I just had my biggest one was I took me forever and I had to finally Google it to figure out
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:36.060]   how to find my pulling up to all of my apps because they don't have them all on my various
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.060]   screens.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:41.020]   So the full app view, they changed it.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:45.500]   So instead, if you're looking, if you're on Android 12 and you're pulling up from the
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:51.820]   bottom like you normally do, that just gives you the windows that you have open to mess
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.820]   with.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:56.460]   But so you have to pull up kind of from the middle as opposed to from the bottom to get
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.460]   your own.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.620]   From the very, very bottom, you're right.
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:59.620]   You're right.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:03.580]   If you're if the thumb starts on that gesture pill or whatever you want to call it at the
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:07.140]   bottom, that's going to do a different action.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.460]   I do it all the time.
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:12.660]   And I just I was like, I'm flipping it.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.300]   I'm like, huh, flipping again.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.500]   I'm like, huh, it was to change something.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.660]   And then I'm like, I usually see me.
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:22.700]   I was like a frustrated monkey just jab it on my phone trying to figure out which other,
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.660]   you know, I was like, this way, this way, this way gestures.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:32.300]   It was it was less outfalls until I just just like, okay, I'm just going to have to let
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.300]   this up.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.300]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.180]   Well, it's interesting that you mentioned that because last night on all about Android
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:41.060]   Ron, Ron told the story, his sister had the same experience.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.380]   I can actually show it off if, if anybody's interested in seeing it.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.300]   So you've got the little, the little gesture pill down at the bottom.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.580]   If you swipe up from there, what's what's it's meant to do is if you swipe up and hold,
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:58.380]   that gives you access to, to your recent apps, right?
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.100]   But if you're kind of in this middle area, you do it, it gives you access to your apps.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:05.420]   But one thing that it will do is if you do it a couple of times, trying to get it from
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.940]   there, then it'll give you that little hint and be like, Oh, no, do it up here.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.940]   And say this is how you use this.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.260]   And you don't, and you don't have to use the little pill.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.300]   And I mean, like anywhere along the bottom, it works.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.300]   But sorry, let me rephrase that anywhere along the bottom, it pulls up all of your open
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.300]   windows.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.300]   It's like, what is that on hot, hot corners on your back?
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.300]   Anyway.
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.300]   Oh, right.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.300]   Right.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.300]   Right.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   Right.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.300]   Right.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:38.340]   Do you all use temper glass on your phones?
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:43.460]   Or do you just use a regular screen protector, one of the flimsy scratch resistant screen
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.460]   protectors?
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.780]   You use a screen protector at all.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.660]   Yeah, I don't have a screen protector on this.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:54.420]   In general, if it doesn't approve, if it ships with one, I keep it on, but I never
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.380]   think to buy one and put it on.
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.380]   Interesting.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.020]   So they've never shattered a screen.
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.820]   I've shattered one of the screen phones.
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.820]   I've made for the protection.
[00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:09.420]   Oh, I always have to have a case on my phone.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.580]   So it doesn't work.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:15.580]   Well, I have a case online and that protects the edges and things like that.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.060]   I just don't want to chip the screen.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:23.580]   I've seen too many people walking around here in public with these charred screen.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.940]   Yeah, they're just chipped and their thumbs are bleeding and I'm like, that could have
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:29.940]   been prevented.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:30.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.700]   If you had put a screen protector on there.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:40.700]   The problem though is when I got the phone, the tempered glass wasn't quite available
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.260]   on Amazon for this particular model.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:50.100]   So I temporarily had a six tempered glass on here and I finally got the six pro version
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.260]   to put on here.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.420]   But it isn't quite ready for the fingerprint reader on there.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.260]   And a lot of them, if you look on Amazon for it, it'll say, hey, this is not going to work
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:03.300]   with your fingerprint reader just yet.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.780]   But some are starting to pop up in there now and I just ordered one last night that said
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.180]   it's supposed to work with the fingerprint reader.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:15.660]   I won't know until next week when it gets here, but that's something for people to consider.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:21.740]   Even though it says it's not going to work, I can still set up the fingerprint profile
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.740]   in here.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:27.260]   But when I lock the phone and try to unlock it with the fingerprint, it won't do it, which
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.260]   makes no sense to me.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:34.060]   How could I even set up the fingerprint profile, but not be able to unlock the phone with it?
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.420]   It can make the key, but you can't fit it in the door.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.180]   That's so weird.
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.180]   That's so weird.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.660]   And then I also thought, well, maybe I should try the little pattern thing on there just
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.660]   to see what that's like.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.340]   I haven't done a pattern in forever.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:50.020]   Yeah, I mean, and that didn't work either.
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:55.340]   I could create it, but I couldn't get back into the phone, which meant I'm stuck.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:55:01.940]   So I had to do a factory reset from the bootloader to get back into my phone.
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:07.700]   Yeah, and see, these are all great reasons why I don't have one on my screen.
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.020]   It has nothing to do with any of that.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:15.300]   But it sounds like I should maybe take that warning and not put one on for now.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.740]   Yeah, I never--
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.300]   Scooter X just says in the chat that there's a setting in the touch preferences for screen
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.300]   protector.
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.460]   I'll look for that.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.940]   There might be a sensitivity slider.
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:27.940]   Sometimes they--
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.780]   Remember that from Android 10 or Android 11 didn't think about it now, though.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.140]   Yeah, let's see.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:38.340]   I need to change my color scheme, because like--
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:42.820]   Yeah, so you're now on Android 12, and you didn't have Android 12 before, right?
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:43.820]   You weren't doing the beta.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.420]   Right, I wasn't doing the beta.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:50.500]   I mean, it's fine.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.860]   Anytime something changes, you're automatically like, "Ah!"
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:56.660]   Like, "Do I love the clock?
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.660]   Is it--?"
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:01.340]   I mean, it looks better, but I'm like, "Is it more legible?"
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.340]   No.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   Everything feels--
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.340]   I still hate that much.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.340]   I still hate that much.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.340]   I still hate pink.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.060]   Yeah, everything feels less legible, and because I have a picture of a quaca on my phone--
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.380]   Oh, yeah, yours is all pink--
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.620]   Minus on diarrhea brown, and I hate it.
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:17.420]   Baby, we call that on the show.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.500]   We call that baby couldn't help it brown.
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.500]   Baby, that's right.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.500]   That was last week.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.500]   That's what everything--
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.500]   That's what we call it.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.500]   I'm like, "Ugh."
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:31.180]   So, I either have to change my picture or have to go in and figure out how to change the
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.300]   colors, but I kind of resent.
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.620]   I'm like, "What is so like--?"
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:36.620]   What is that?
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.060]   That was like when I was in high school, and you would change your Microsoft--
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.540]   Was it Microsoft?
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:42.540]   What was it?
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:45.500]   You would go in and custom scheme every-- anyway, the point is--
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.140]   Yeah, yeah, that was custom skin.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.140]   I don't have to--
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.780]   Totally, I remember doing that with Windows.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   Yeah, and you would--
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.580]   Well, I would spend lots of time.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.220]   Like, what looks good at turquoise?
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.060]   This speaks to my aesthetic.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.060]   Yes, right.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.060]   That's so me.
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:07.180]   Right, and this is called material you, which makes the impression, and Google has signaled
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.820]   as much that this is all about customizing to you.
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:12.620]   But there have been a lot of people that have pointed out.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:17.980]   Actually, the previous version of Android allowed me to do more customization than what
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.500]   this is allowing me to do.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.500]   So it's kind of an interesting--
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:25.340]   Oh, I assumed if I figured it out how to do it, it would tell me.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.340]   Look at that.
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.340]   Look at that.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.620]   Oh, you can't-- you're not getting the color, but it's really gross.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:31.620]   Mm-hmm.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:37.580]   And I just did this green sensitivity setting on here, and it still does not recognize
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.380]   my fingerprint with this screen protector on.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:46.620]   So I have to wait to get the new screen protector and try it out.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.620]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:51.820]   Well, basically, do you find that the finger thing works?
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.180]   Yeah, totally.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:57.340]   I actually tweeted about that this weekend because I noticed a lot of reviews and a lot
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.140]   of people complaining about the fingerprint sensor.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:03.940]   I'm like, you know, my experience has not been bad with it.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.020]   Maybe a little bit better with the 6 that I'm using right now than the 6 Pro that Leo
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:11.300]   has, but I mean, that could be just how he set it up because they both have the same
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:12.300]   sensor.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.900]   So it's not like one has a different type of sensor than the other.
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:21.660]   No, I mean, I'm able to get into my phone almost every time with my fingerprint.
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:25.100]   I don't know if it's, you know, when you're training it, if there's a better way to train
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:29.220]   it than others because I've certainly had phones that like, no matter how I trained
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:33.540]   my finger on the sensor, you know, every single time it went to unlock my phone, I had to
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.700]   do my tap two or three times before I got in.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.900]   And that's super annoying.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.540]   I am not getting that experience with the 6 right now.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:44.540]   I didn't have that experience with it just not working when I didn't have the screen
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.540]   predicting it worked.
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:50.140]   You know, it was just, I definitely could tell it was slower than previous phones, but it
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:51.140]   worked.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:56.180]   And even that slower is just that much slower, you know, it wasn't terrible.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:57.180]   Right.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.180]   Right.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:02.900]   So yeah, I, you know, it could just come down to the fact that everybody uses their phone
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.860]   a little differently.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:10.020]   I don't know that it's any worse than, you know, other fingerprint sensors out there.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:14.220]   I'm just, I'm also not a like, my preference is not an in display sensor.
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:20.100]   I think that they're less, less reliable, less effective in general versus a hardware
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.100]   sensor.
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:25.460]   I like the, the rear device, you know, touch sensor that we've had on all the pixels.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.100]   Um, here, here Jason.
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:29.820]   I agree with them.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:33.860]   Give me that, that, that one on the back that just felt more natural because your hands
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.060]   already sort of right there.
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.380]   Yeah, it's right there.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.380]   There's a tactile.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.980]   It's more sexy.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.080]   It's more integrated.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:47.300]   It makes the back of the phone look sleeker because it doesn't have a big old hole in
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.300]   the middle of it or something.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.320]   This is part of that whole lakes.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.300]   Like, there's more than one design aesthetic y'all.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:58.680]   We do not all have to look like the sleek future blobs from the apples anyway.
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.940]   Having said that, I like the design of the Pixel six.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.820]   Like I'm, you know, like I'm, I'm, it's okay.
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.620]   Like the video gets back.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.860]   The sensor is in the front is fine.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.100]   Well, the yoga gets back.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.460]   Would you prefer the pro or the six?
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.200]   And that's an interesting question because I have actually really enjoyed the smaller
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.180]   six and I think, and I don't know that I would have expected that prior to the six
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:28.300]   pro, I was using the five, which is way smaller and I just, which felt super small when I
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.060]   started finally using it.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.740]   You know, it took me a while to switch over from the four XL to the five.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.220]   And when I did, it was like, wow, this is a tiny phone.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.620]   Like this is going to take some use to it.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.060]   And then I got used to it.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:43.140]   And then the six pro comes, it's like back to gigantic phone.
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.420]   And now that I've been using the six for the last week, I would totally stay with the six
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.940]   if it had that telephoto lens.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:56.100]   I just, I know me and the cameras on my phone and I, I want slash need that hardware, that
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.740]   like optical lens for, for telephoto.
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.020]   It's just, it's a, it's a lens that I use all the time.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.820]   And so that's kind of worth it for me to use the six pro, but I would prefer the six
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:07.260]   if I had my choice.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.380]   If the six had that, I would be fine sticking with it.
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.620]   I think that's a great factor, but the six pro hardware is what you're saying.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.620]   Right.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.860]   Yeah, I suppose so, which, you know, kind of speaks to the fact that Google used to give
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.420]   different sizes with similar, with the same hardware between both.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.620]   And now they're kind of doing the trend where the smaller one is less capable and the larger
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:30.820]   one is more capable is even more premium than the premium phone.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.820]   You know, that's a little smaller and, which is kind of a bummer.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:39.740]   It would be nice if, if both phones had, you know, all the bells and whistles, but having
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:44.460]   used both, do you think the price difference is justified?
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.460]   Mmm.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.460]   Good question.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:53.060]   I think, I think no question the value pick when the dust settles is the six.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:58.460]   The six pro is nice, but you're paying $300 extra dollars for a handful of features that,
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.020]   I don't know, are they worth the $300 extra dollars?
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.540]   That's a lot, you know, that's, right.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.660]   That's a, that's a considerable bump up.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.340]   And so I would, I would probably recommend the six pro.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.340]   Ha.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:19.740]   So it reminds me of Canon with it's R six versus the R five last year.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:25.100]   I took, had both of those cameras in hand and shared images from both of them, the same
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:32.500]   shot and both of them look really dad gum good, but one did not look $1,500 better than the
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.500]   other one.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.500]   Yeah.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500]   Right.
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.340]   That's, that's often the case.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:44.180]   I mean, like when you go up to the premium thing, you're, yeah.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:49.260]   But how I was looking at someone who buys a lot of premium stuff, it's kind of like,
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.820]   oh, it's kind of like whiskey.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:56.220]   You know, if you age it, you know, after about the 12 to 15 year period, going up is kind
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.220]   of gimmicky.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.300]   There's, you got the complexity you need.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.300]   Right.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.900]   And then as I going up, bragging rights.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.900]   So true.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.900]   All right.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:10.700]   Thanks for letting me show those pictures off.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.700]   That was awesome.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.700]   Man, fun, totally.
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.700]   Right.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.700]   Love it.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.500]   I still want to shoot some more and I've been playing with some stuff out in landscape
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.740]   scenarios and stuff like that.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.820]   I want to shoot some street photography with it head over to Santa Rosa and just walk around
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:32.420]   town and do a little street photography with it and see how it performs out there and
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.860]   just regular day to day life.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.900]   Because that's what most people are going to use these camera phones for.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.900]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.900]   No question.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:41.460]   And I mean, you know, next week Leo returns to this show.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.860]   I can almost guarantee you.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.260]   I mean, maybe not, but I imagine he's going to show some of his photos from the six pro
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:51.940]   from, you know, being in Mexico at a very cool time, you know, being there for the day
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.180]   of the dead and everything.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:56.420]   He probably got some pretty awesome shots.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:00.700]   And so, and so I don't know if it's his plan to show it next week, but I'm telling you
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.100]   so that you can remind him so that maybe he'll show you some of the shots because that would
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.700]   be a really good example of what you're talking about, right?
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.980]   Like having the right camera for the right experience and what are the pictures that
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.500]   you get out of that.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.500]   I'm curious to see.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:19.700]   Someone asked me, I can't remember if it was in our discord or just on social, but someone
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:23.980]   asked, okay, this six pro has this telephoto lens on it.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.100]   Can I go to the ball game and take pictures of it?
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.780]   Take pictures of the game with that telephoto lens.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:35.940]   And I think the way these telephoto lenses are being marketed to people is they assume
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.060]   they can do that.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.940]   No, you can't.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:45.300]   It's still a tiny half inch sensor and you're trying to zoom in on a football player, basketball
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.820]   player or race car going by.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.460]   It's not going to look good.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.460]   It's just not.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:54.060]   You need a lens on a camera body.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.980]   He just got a larger sensor and much better optics on that lens.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:01.820]   If you're trying to do some zoom in like that, right?
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:09.580]   As a journalist, when I was working for places that had photographers but still sent us out,
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:12.180]   they're like, look, zoom it through feet.
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.100]   Don't try to do anything else.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.100]   Just zoom with your feet.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.140]   And I'm like, okay.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.140]   That's so true.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:20.140]   That's smart.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.140]   Very true.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.140]   It's probably the best.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.180]   I mean, I'm by no means a photographer.
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.220]   So that was probably the best advice they could have given us.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.860]   Bend those knees and walk slowly.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.420]   It's like a panning shot.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.300]   If you're recording video, I guess.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.220]   Let's take a break and then we will come back and we'll talk about more.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.620]   Maybe when we come back, we can talk about Zillow and there's so much more in there
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.340]   to touch on.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.860]   But first, let's take a moment and thank the sponsor of this episode.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:55.620]   This week in Google is brought to you by Andela, which is a global talent network with a mission
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.540]   to connect brilliance with opportunity.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.340]   Your company is expected to move faster than ever before.

[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:10.420]   And we thank Andela for their support of this week in Google.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.340]   All right.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:18.060]   So let's talk a little bit about Zillow, which is not a topic I thought would come up on
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.060]   this show.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.260]   But hey, here we are.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:25.540]   Zillow is apparently ending its home buying business, which is a business that it, from
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:30.820]   my understanding, I hadn't been following this until this news broke, but it's kind of interesting.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:35.540]   They were buying up properties all over the country or the world.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.540]   I'm not really quite sure.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.380]   But they were using their AI system to help them to identify properties that they could
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.260]   buy, basically fix and flip, right?
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.580]   Buy up the properties, flip it.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:52.820]   Yes, they would make a profit, but Zillow would really earn a 5% convenience fee on the
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:56.580]   deal, on the deal that came out of that.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.540]   And they're now saying that they're getting out of that.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:05.420]   They're going to end up losing somewhere in the realm of $500 million in the process.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.620]   They're selling off the properties that they do have.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.740]   The rooms are right.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:14.220]   Their AI is calculated on both sides of the equation, both on what is a good price to
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.060]   buy and then what is the potential of the future sale.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:22.860]   It's just so volatile and so unpredictable that apparently their systems did not work
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.780]   in this case.
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:29.140]   They pitched 7,000 of their homes to institutional investors.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.300]   And I thought this was interesting.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:34.500]   I think maybe you placed this in here, Jeff, but I had read a little bit about this too,
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:39.780]   that there were some TikTok videos that were kind of trying to understand exactly what this
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:41.540]   whole Zillow thing was.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.820]   And you posted this in here.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.700]   So maybe you can give it an explanation.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.700]   But it's interesting.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.740]   Yeah, so I didn't realize TikTok was doing this.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:51.740]   And what shocks me about it is that it's a tremendous conflict of interest because TikTok
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:11:01.300]   is the service that people use now as much as anything to find out the value of homes.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:05.340]   So they can, and that's something that they make up out of the air based on comps, but
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.580]   they can adjust that one way or the other.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.660]   And then they can have an impact on the market.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.340]   The market's just there buying and they're a participant.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.180]   So that's pretty yucky.
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:21.740]   So there's a guy who's been a real estate agent for 11 years who put up a video saying,
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.340]   here's what could go wrong with this for the market.
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.660]   So I don't know if you want to play a little bit of it.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.940]   Yeah, it's pretty interesting.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:36.700]   And if we can't play it, it's just that Twitter link that's below the story, Line 42, John.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:42.500]   But I mean, yeah, if we can't play it, I mean, it's essentially, he's talking about Zillow,
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:48.580]   you know, finding a whole group of properties in a particular region, a particular area,
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.900]   buying them all up, selling, sending 300,000.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.900]   Oh, right.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.740]   Here's this guy does a good job.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.740]   Yeah, he does a really good job.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:01.420]   Everybody used everybody used everybody new up to look for houses and everybody goes on
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.940]   there and searches for houses when they're bored and stuff.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:07.300]   And so that company, they just sit back and they just collect all the data.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:11.940]   They just know what zip code is looking at what zip code and how much those people can
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:12.940]   afford.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.380]   Everyone's looking at this one zip code and everybody seems to be able to afford this
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.380]   certain amount.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:21.900]   And let's say that billion dollar company uses that information to go into that zip code
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.860]   and start purchasing houses because the people that are selling their houses, even though
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:29.660]   they sell it for a little bit less, sometimes than what the home could actually be worth.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.260]   And they pay these high fees to this billion dollar company.
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:33.900]   It's a convenience factor.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.460]   So this company's scooping up houses less than what they actually could cost.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:44.140]   And let's say that that company, excuse me, can you that company, I was 30 with it to
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.380]   my own radius and let's say the price is 300,000.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.780]   So they buy all of these home for 300,000.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:58.100]   And then on the 31st home, they buy it for 340, even though they know all of the all
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.300]   of the combs because most people have to get a loan.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.820]   If you get a loan, you have to get an appraisal, which means the appraiser is going to look
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:08.420]   at what homes have sold in the area for that size net price per square foot.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.740]   So they're paying cash.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.900]   They don't need an appraisal.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:17.260]   Why would they pay 340 for this 31st home?
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.900]   Whatever, they've only paid 300 for these others.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.700]   Well, what that just did is create a new comp.
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.340]   So when they go to sell these other 30 homes, that extra 40,000 dollars, you can say this
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:34.980]   one sold for 340, just made them 1.2 million off that one neighbor because they know from
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.700]   their research how much people can afford in that account.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.740]   And let's say that then they're going to come in, they bought that home at 340 that
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.940]   still needs work.
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.540]   So they're going to come in and do their good old paint spackle and change the carpet and
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.540]   call it a remodel.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:54.420]   So now we can tell them for 360 because we know off of our data that so much people can't
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   afford.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.580]   Wouldn't that be weird if a company did that?
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:02.380]   And then say that this company also starts letting you use their own lenders and their
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.620]   own title as your company.
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.020]   It makes you write your contract on this.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.020]   It goes on.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.100]   It's really well explained, I thought.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.100]   Yeah, super well.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:19.020]   It's exactly what happened with the LIBOR scandal back in 2012 or so.
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:22.660]   I mean, that is which is, hey, we have insider knowledge.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:26.300]   We're going to use that to set up a basic comp price.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.180]   And then we're going to benefit off of that.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.180]   Repeat.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.860]   Oh, so such a scheme.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:32.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.460]   And they did it badly.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:38.740]   They're the Trump, Trump owning a casino.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.780]   Only he could lose money owning a casino.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:47.460]   And so they owned ends of the market and they had a I don't know what was going on
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:49.860]   and they screwed it up.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:53.620]   I was obviously not working for them.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:54.620]   They're getting out.
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:15:01.100]   But I mean, this, so this TikTok video, I mean, okay, I, it's brilliant, brilliantly
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.100]   laid out.
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.140]   Is that exactly what's happening here, though, or is that just his thing?
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.860]   Well, there's two things happening.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:12.500]   They're in trouble from the TikTok video did influence people to look at what they're
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:20.860]   doing, but their AI also, because of the current craziness in the housing market, suddenly
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:26.500]   they're like, oh, we did not account for this and the outcome.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.500]   Perfect.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.500]   Open door.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.500]   Is it, is it open door?
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.980]   Is that the, there's another real estate company that just did the same thing.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.420]   Same thing because they were like, oh, cricky.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.420]   Yes.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:41.060]   They, they just had to lay off people and yeah.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.660]   It affects people's lives in their houses.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.900]   Their stock fell from one oh five last Friday to 65 today.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.900]   Couldn't happen to my server scam.
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:59.780]   I heard a little bit about this, you know, a handful of months ago, some, some people
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:04.260]   back East, especially in the Atlanta area and those suburbs there.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.260]   People were.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.260]   That is a popular place.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.260]   They're in offers.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.260]   Tutions.
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:09.260]   Mm hmm.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:14.500]   People were getting offers on their home and everybody was basically trying to encourage
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:18.740]   each other to push back and say, don't take the offer.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:26.300]   This is how, this is how people of color are losing the ability of owning homes because
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.620]   it's not like a lot of us own homes.
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:33.860]   Anyway, you own a home, stop just giving it away and just sort of selling out.
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.140]   And that was the big push that I heard about it.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:40.260]   It's all, it was all from Zillow coming in writing big checks and everybody saying, no,
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.260]   don't take the check.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.420]   That's all I heard about it back then.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.820]   It's not just Zillow.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.860]   There's actually a lot of private equity firms are now.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:55.540]   There's company called, uh, homes of America, America homes and then invitation homes.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.540]   And those are.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:57.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:58.540]   That was the other one.
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.700]   They come in and buy single family starter homes as an investment.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:08.500]   What they're trying to do is basically generate a portfolio of consistent revenue generation,
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.140]   like monthly revenue generation from the rent.
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:14.260]   And plus they own the underlying asset.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:19.180]   And from there, they can, you know, securitize it or do whatever they want.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.100]   So that's what's happening.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:24.260]   Zillow, it.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:31.220]   That's a slightly different thing, but a lot of people it correlated as the same, but those
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.180]   people will continue to own the homes as an asset.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:39.900]   Whereas the Zillow people are trying to make money on the commissions and, um, kind of flip
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.740]   the homes for the most part.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:45.740]   Think they're seeking to own the homes over the long term.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.540]   Just flip it.
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:51.420]   But either way, both are a tool for gentrification and both are right.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:18:02.940]   So being pushed the cost of single family affordable, like starter style homes in markets.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.420]   And there's the Atlantic did a good look at it where they were like, this isn't so bad
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:11.460]   because they looked at like the absolute number of homes that were being purchased, but they
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.660]   didn't look at the type of homes.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:22.380]   And so it's there's a, it's a very controversial thing, I would say, especially as we're seeing
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:25.300]   kind of a home shortage.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.820]   And as I mentioned, it is a tool for gentrification.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:33.020]   Yeah, when I'm in Charlotte, there was, you know, within the last 10 years, there was
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.580]   a couple of different neighborhoods that I can remember looking at that was considered
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.020]   the hood in their quotes.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:44.500]   But now you go there, you, you better have a couple million in the bank if you want to
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.500]   live there.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:52.180]   Uh, because people went in and bought up those hood, tastic homes or single family homes and
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:56.340]   destroyed them and pushed everybody out of that area.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:59.860]   And it doesn't look the same as it did 10 years ago.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.500]   Bill Thermic mentions.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.500]   Yep.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.500]   Yeah, indeed.
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.500]   Wow.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.660]   And then I'm curious what happens.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:15.180]   So when, so let's say Zillow moves into a neighborhood and buys up all these homes and
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:20.140]   then starts creating the new comps by selling them for way more and does this with the entire
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.140]   neighborhood.
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:28.060]   I mean, that was, that was a manufactured, uh, inflation of the price at a wide scale that
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.620]   covers a large geographic area.
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.700]   Once Zillow is done, does that ever come back down to earth or does it stay up there?
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.700]   Has Zillow driven it up?
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:42.580]   That's a 2008 financial crisis in Las Vegas or Phoenix.
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:47.180]   Eventually they, I mean, right now that I would be interested to see if anyone in Vegas
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:51.100]   or Phoenix is your home back above water.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.100]   Right.
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:57.420]   That was caused by cheap financing, but this is basically caused by over inflated valuations.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:19:59.420]   Which could lead.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.420]   I think there's got to be an investigation.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.420]   Absolutely.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:03.180]   You want to investigate an algorithm?
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:06.580]   Uh, investigate that is to say the output of it.
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.740]   Were there any patterns once they went into this business?
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:14.500]   Was there any pattern of actual sale versus Zillow price comp?
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:17.180]   Um, because it wasn't, it's not just a comp.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.540]   That's, that's the idea of the issue.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:24.700]   The comp is the actual sale of a nearby house, but Zillow of course gives you a projected
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.700]   price of your house.
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:33.100]   Uh, they got the stockpile and they're saying, and this stockpile is actually worth this.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.860]   Not the, they could say it's worth it.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:39.180]   One is they could undercut the price with their, if they're in the market to buy and
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:42.100]   they could, they could say, well, no, your house is only worth 280.
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.100]   If left, left, right.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.780]   But that's it, right.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:48.100]   Or they can inflate it when they're in the market to sell.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.180]   Because they can get off both ends of it.
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:55.260]   Hold on though, because what happens is when you do unless, unless this is all cash.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.740]   So if this is all cash and you're buying cat, buy to house with cash, go you.
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:04.740]   Um, but if you're going to seek a loan, what will happen is this actually happened to us
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:08.860]   here, the person who's giving you your loan is going to come in and send out their own
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.980]   person to value the house and do an estimate.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:15.940]   And then if that estimate is not a line, then you can't get finance.
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.020]   But what I'm saying Stacey is you could have an impact on the actual sales by people's
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.980]   impressions one way or the other.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.980]   Yeah, most people know that those estimates are whatever pretty inflated.
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:32.420]   I mean, you talk to anybody about their value of the, you know, oh, Zillow doesn't have
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   it.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:38.380]   It's either too hot, your T cat or your county assessor has it too high and they usually
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:41.380]   have it too low and, you know, whatever.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:45.900]   Anyway, fascinating story that, who would have thought that we'd have an A.
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.860]   I ethical tech regulation story out of Zillow.
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:51.860]   Exactly.
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:52.860]   Didn't see that.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:53.860]   Yeah, sir.
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:54.860]   Very interesting.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:22:02.860]   Um, did you know that the Google's forced two factor authentication switchovers starting
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:03.860]   to happen?
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:07.220]   They had, they had mentioned that it was going to happen by the end of 2021.
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:11.140]   They had estimated around 150 million accounts were going to be auto enrolled into factor
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:12.140]   authentication.
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:15.860]   Uh, but now apparently there are a lot of reports coming through saying it's happening
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:20.780]   people are getting notified and when they get notified, they have seven days before
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.700]   the switch takes place.
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:28.420]   Um, if they haven't, if they haven't set like set up an authenticator link with an app on
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:35.220]   their phone by then or an, or a set up SMS code authentication, it automatically activates
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.620]   via Google's own two step verification.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.800]   And that's the, that's the one where it gives you the prompt on the phone on another device
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:45.780]   or whatever to say, Hey, is, you know, are you
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.380]   logging in over here?
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:53.460]   Um, so that would be the, the method that would be used, but, um, uh, it's, it's beginning.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:59.540]   Do we foresee any, uh, any major or I'm one, I'm sitting here thinking about this news
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:07.460]   and either everybody here in the Pruitt household is already on two F a or it hasn't rolled
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.460]   out to them yet.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.740]   I'm leaning more towards B.
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:12.740]   Probably not.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:15.340]   Because I haven't heard it's not very many.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.340]   I haven't heard someone.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.340]   You haven't heard the complaints.
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.340]   It's on my phone.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.940]   Wait, wait, I can't get into my account anymore.
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:22.940]   Okay.
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.980]   I only, I only know that my daughter is doing something on her computer when she comes down
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:31.540]   after she's like, mom, my, my computer won't turn on anymore.
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.100]   I just downloaded, you know, this OS up.
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:36.300]   I'm like, oh, don't.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:44.300]   I just want to, I want to go back because this has not been really widely reported, but it's
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.780]   ties to your tech ethics, which is worth noting.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.420]   And it's, it's actually pretty cool.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:54.460]   This week the, I had to, I was slow to get it because I couldn't remember the acronym
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:24:00.700]   for the agency, but the US equal employment opportunity commission, the EOC, they're actually
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:07.340]   launching an initiative to ensure that AI used in hiring and employment decision complies
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.540]   with federal civil rights laws.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:10.540]   Good.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:11.540]   Good.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:16.420]   So this is, this is kind of, I mean, you could argue that the, in the home world, I guess
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:20.740]   Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could kind of look at Zillow, but this is actually a chance to
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:29.620]   actually regulate the hiring practices that may choose people named Keith over people
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.620]   named Dwayne or whatever.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.620]   Right.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:38.180]   The thing you do in that case is you're not regulating the AI, you're regulating this
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:40.660]   output, which is a more sensible way to go.
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:46.140]   You're going to, you're going to audit what it does, which is perfectly sensible to do
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.860]   and, and see what bias is built in.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:52.580]   And it's also, but, but, but the interesting thing is Stacey, I think it also, because
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:25:01.220]   of the data sets that are used in hiring, it also puts a spotlight on the actual hiring
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:05.540]   that feeds the AI, which is also necessary.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:09.620]   So having the data set of hiring and knowing what those trends are, you go after hiring
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:12.580]   managers and you see what's going on out there.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:18.060]   And then when you, when you replicate that bias in your AI, yes, you want to go out for
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.060]   that as well.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.660]   You want to go out for both real life and AI.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.660]   Yes.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:25.100]   And they, they're, they're efforts.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:29.660]   So this is, hopefully this is what other enforcement at this level will start to look
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:33.140]   like, but what they're doing, it's not quite as deep as you would like it to be.
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:34.780]   I'll just tell you that right now.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.820]   They're going to, I got to do their working group.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.340]   They're going to listen to the whole public.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.820]   And you are going to be like, this is the issue.
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.940]   That's actually important in this because as long as they listen to everybody, it's important
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.940]   to know what to look for, like how is bias, especially when you're blind to it because
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:52.860]   you're a bunch of white open.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:56.580]   And then they're going to figure out, you know, what's, then they're going to look at
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.580]   the impact.
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:58.580]   So that's a thing.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:03.240]   They're going to look also not just for bad ones, but good ones so they can identify
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:09.100]   promising efforts there and promulgate those and then try to issue technical guidance to
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:13.300]   any organization that asks for it based on what they've identified.
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.060]   So I think that's actually pretty good.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:20.340]   I just, I was really excited because this is the first effort of this kind to come from
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.440]   the federal government, even though we've been talking about meeting stuff like this
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.780]   forever.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:31.220]   So it's small landmark that nobody noticed in tech and AI ethics.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.220]   Good.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.980]   Yeah, I didn't see it either.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:39.300]   And I was trying to search it, you know, so that I could add it to the, I put it on 139
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:40.300]   for you.
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:41.420]   No, no, no, it's okay.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:45.340]   But to speaking to your point, I tried to search it just through Google and it took me,
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:49.940]   it took me, no one covered this deeper Google food actually located.
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:51.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.940]   It's line 129 for you.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:53.940]   I tried to help you out.
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:54.940]   Got it.
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.940]   I appreciate that.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:56.940]   Thank you.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:57.940]   Thank you.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.940]   But I think you're pretty.
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.180]   I was like, I know you're spinning your plates like that.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:03.420]   I can picture you going, where the hell were that?
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:04.420]   I know.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:08.620]   I have the different ways of talking while I'm locating a cell to put the order of the
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:14.580]   story that that came and what time and everything we think we make it happen.
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.620]   What else emails 50 years old?
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.220]   Did you celebrate emails 50 year birthday?
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.220]   By throwing my email.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.220]   Yes.
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:25.220]   Yes.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.380]   How do you celebrate exactly?
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.460]   Do you delete all your emails or do you create more emails?
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.900]   I hate to get, because there, you know, there's, I don't want to get into it because poor,
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.780]   poor Mazna had to go through this.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:39.060]   There's one guy, I don't want to say his name, who claims that he invented email and goes
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:41.860]   after anybody who says somebody else did.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.660]   So I go in there.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:45.860]   I don't want to get sued by him.
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.460]   Well, I found.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.420]   No need in my inbox.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:55.460]   So I made my first email, I had my first email account when I was like in at home, but my
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:01.740]   college email account was my first like one for me, not part of my dad's like compu-serve
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.740]   account, right?
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:08.420]   Or prodigy, we had both.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:13.980]   And I went in and I found one of my college emails that I apparently had forwarded to
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:20.580]   my email account when I transitioned from whatever to whatever, whatever.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.940]   And oh my God.
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:29.500]   I used to like write these soulful like like 19th century letter style emails.
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:34.060]   Remember when you were right to your friends via like using email?
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.940]   I can't think of a replacement for a letter.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.780]   It literally was a replacement for a letter in the beginning.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:41.780]   Yes.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:42.780]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:47.300]   What was the last time I sent a multi paragraph email that wasn't like a formal memo?
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.300]   Yeah.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:52.060]   We've come a long way.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:56.860]   You say that and that's where I feel like I'm the only person on the planet to still
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:01.460]   use this email from a personal standpoint.
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:06.740]   People are accessible through social media and that's great.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.420]   But it can only go so far on social media in my experience.
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:12.820]   There's some things that are personal.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:17.860]   I don't want to put out there and I tend to tell people, hey, either call me, they know
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:23.580]   who they are or shoot me an email and we can chit chat and whatnot.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:30.220]   And when I say email, it's almost like I could see the deer in headlights and reaction from
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:31.220]   them.
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.220]   It's like email?
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:33.220]   What is email?
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.580]   Oh, that's where I send spam.
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.580]   Right.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.580]   Got it.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:43.500]   I mean, I said people like the last heartfelt email I sent was to one of my friends about
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:49.340]   a year ago when their father passed and it was just to sum up.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:55.220]   It was basically in lieu of a card because Lord only knows where her physical address.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:59.820]   But just reminiscing about her dad.
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:03.140]   It felt personal.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:06.740]   But that's like the last and that was a special occasion.
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:15.820]   So do you all know people beyond your PR list and work list that actually check their
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:19.180]   email regularly?
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.900]   Like if I send an email to this or that person.
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:26.580]   Check it and do something about it are two very different questions.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:28.580]   Good point.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:36.220]   My daughter doesn't check her email except she has a personal email and she has a school
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:37.220]   email.
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:42.620]   She checks her school meal every day by and they actually put a timeframe like no assignments
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.820]   after eight.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:46.580]   So that's good because she checks it at eight o'clock.
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.580]   That's nice.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:48.580]   Never again.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:54.940]   And her personal email she checks like maybe once a week.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.940]   Wow.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:56.940]   Wow.
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:03.940]   I'm in my inbox every day and I follow down to the inbox zero.
[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.740]   Oh, no, I hate you.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.500]   I finally got it down.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:15.060]   But I still check it every day for just for random messages from people that I haven't
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:16.820]   talked to in a while.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:19.140]   And it's nice when I see those.
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:23.420]   But yeah, most of the time it's a bunch of spam and other gibberish in there.
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:24.660]   I don't care about it.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.660]   I only have.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:26.660]   Check it every day.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.060]   Yeah, I check my email every day.
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:36.820]   But well, I check my personal email daily and my work email is just like it's just always
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.820]   up.
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:41.860]   But I literally have no personal emails.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:47.620]   I have a woman who's yeah, checking up on an appointment who's a real person, but everything
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.500]   else is crap.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:58.540]   Yeah, I'm that guy who says basically says to myself, third time, maybe I'll play attention
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:31:59.540]   to it.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:02.180]   But a lot of times it's just I don't know what it is.
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:03.540]   And it is important enough.
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.540]   They'll come back.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:07.540]   I'm going to be confused.
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.340]   I'm feeling those important messages three times.
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:15.060]   I can't do this and deans.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.580]   I've got to pay attention to students.
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.580]   I would pay attention to.
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.180]   But when I screw up that, I feel very embarrassed.
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:25.020]   But other than that, but this is when Facebook comes back into the picture because people
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:30.100]   would much rather you communicate through Facebook for those personal chats now instead
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.460]   of sending something to you.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:35.220]   Well, I think that's the key personal chat.
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:41.620]   When I think of communicating with my friends, yeah, it used to be long, soliloically slash
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.100]   letters on email.
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.860]   And now it is chats.
[01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:51.980]   Like any of my distant friends who don't live in the area, close friends or whatever,
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:55.860]   I'm probably messaging with them via pick your chat client.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.580]   I've got a folder full of them.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:02.060]   But it's no longer sitting down and writing a paragraph.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:05.580]   Well, because you're afraid what's going to come back.
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.620]   It's like a boomerang problem.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:11.700]   They're going to send it back to me.
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:18.020]   And I think it's become a rule of life that every possible communications platform will
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.180]   get overloaded and then useless.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.180]   Right.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.100]   We don't answer our phones anymore.
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:24.780]   We don't want to email anymore.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:29.180]   We dread having slack messages.
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:31.860]   People find our text and it's too much.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:33.860]   Maybe alone.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.340]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:42.180]   Do you think there's more anxiety with email versus those messaging apps, Mr. Jarvis, especially
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:47.460]   when you have the people that's on the iOS platform versus the Android platform, you have
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.700]   what is it, the green bubble versus the big bubble?
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:50.700]   I'm a second-class citizen.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:52.700]   Right.
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.700]   Right.
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.700]   You don't have any of that with the email.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.500]   Let's just type it up and send it.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:02.680]   There's a brilliant guy named Bob Wyman, who used to be at Google, who instructed me
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:07.980]   one day and he said, "The problem with email, Jeff, is from the very," I said, "I can point
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:08.980]   to an email broke.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:11.700]   It's the very first day when they said to make it sender controlled."
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:14.180]   And we've talked about this in relation to Google+.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:22.860]   Because Google+ put on extra layers of receiver control, which for a while made it much better
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.860]   and nice.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:31.860]   But I think the sender controlled is going to get spammed and it's going to become useless.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:36.060]   But we can send them for different newsletters and things like that.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.060]   Oh, newsletters.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.060]   Oh my God.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:39.740]   Who would actually sign up for a newsletter?
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:40.740]   More email?
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.740]   Jeff.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.740]   I have a hard time.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:43.740]   Shut your face.
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:47.140]   I just made a joke.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:51.420]   I do sign up for newsletters, but there's a limited number, right?
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.420]   Yeah, right.
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.980]   And you go to the ones that are valuable like Stacys.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.980]   I go to Ben & Evans.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:58.020]   You don't have to go to mine.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.180]   I know I'm not in your worldview.
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:03.060]   You actually are.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.820]   But there's a limited number.
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:06.980]   There's a finite number.
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:10.620]   And now the Atlantic just hired another eight people to write newsletters.
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:14.380]   The newsletter Overdose is going to hit hard.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.380]   It's hitting hard.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.380]   And what's the matter?
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.780]   I'll subscribe to.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:25.220]   I think is one of those matters of there's a time and place for email.
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:31.740]   That is, if there's something going on between me and my coworkers at Twit, I'm going to
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.740]   send it an email.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:37.740]   If there's something going on with the schools and the students and whatnot, I'd rather have
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:42.660]   that an email just for the time stamps in the paper trail.
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:43.660]   That is true.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:47.140]   There is something to be said for the fact that when you send an email, it's easier to
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:52.740]   refer to, I find it's easier to refer to that paper trail later if I need to refer to something
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:58.900]   versus random chats here and there that might get launched more organized.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:01.420]   Yeah, way easier to find things.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.300]   See, 50 years later, you're still all right email.
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.980]   Just we figured out what you're all right for.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.820]   I'm not getting rid of it.
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:11.740]   I wonder who still uses pine.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.740]   Wow.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.380]   I've heard.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.620]   I've never used it, but I did hear about pine.
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.620]   We're a little young for that.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.620]   Right.
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.860]   Craig Newmark used to use pine since I've known him.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:26.060]   He doesn't know anymore, but he used to.
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.140]   What differentiates pine?
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:31.380]   It's, it's differentiated.
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:35.140]   It's a command structure.
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.140]   You mean?
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:38.140]   Okay.
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.140]   I just like it's the old pre-web.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.140]   It's pulped wood.
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:47.500]   So it's actually, actually, did you know Stacy, that before pulped wood, paper was all made
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:53.620]   from fabrics so that they would, they would advertise to get the ladies to please recycle
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:59.580]   the underwear and hankies and rags because they were needed and there were countries that
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:07.100]   declared rags a strategic national asset and you weren't allowed to exploit, export rags.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:09.100]   Get me going and see what happens.
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.100]   This is a warning.
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.100]   They still have it mentioned.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:12.100]   I know the story.
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:13.100]   I, I, well, I.
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:14.100]   Yeah, poor Jason.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:15.100]   It's like, oh crap.
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:17.260]   I couldn't get the rest of her story.
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:18.260]   Fast.
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:20.260]   Let's squirrel them.
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:21.500]   Squirrel drivers get fast.
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:22.500]   Do anything.
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:26.540]   Do you like a shark in one?
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.660]   You're like a shark in water, Jeff.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:29.660]   You go in there.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.260]   You never know what chicken had come out of the water with it.
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:36.100]   You used underwear and paper, you know?
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.100]   Whoa.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.860]   Oh, hey, Jeff, I thought I thought you might find this interesting.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:43.820]   Wemo cars are coming to New York City.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:44.820]   Are you excited?
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.820]   Yeah, actually I am.
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.820]   It's the other way to die.
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:52.620]   And then the way to die.
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:53.620]   Wow.
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:54.620]   Do you have a look at it?
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:58.620]   Well, I never take cabs in New York City because it's way slower in the subway.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.500]   So I can't imagine that it's going to be very useful.
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500]   Tourists will.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.500]   Sure.
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.500]   Sure.
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:12.660]   Those funny looking cars with the thing on top.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.620]   Any before before we go into the change log, any of these other stories in here, I feel
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.300]   like we've done a whole show.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:21.940]   We've talked about a very small handful of stories, which is not to say it's been bad
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:22.940]   at all.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:23.940]   It's been a lot of fun.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:26.940]   But I feel like there's some of the reasons that we haven't talked about.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:31.140]   I wanted to get Mr. Jarvis's take on Google being back in Spain.
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:33.340]   Yeah, I'm curious about that too.
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:38.100]   So the story here, folks, is that is the Spain.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.100]   Good.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:40.100]   Pardon me.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:41.100]   Germany had what you know.
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:45.540]   All you longtime watchers of the show know was the Leistunguschlstrecht.
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.540]   Yes.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:51.260]   And that was the ancillary copyright that was going to try to restrict Google from quoting
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:54.180]   from news without paying didn't quite work out that way.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.700]   But because it allowed negotiation and Google said, we're not going to link to you.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:01.020]   You want us to link to you, give us permission and we'll link to you.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:02.420]   And that's what happened.
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.380]   Spain replicated it but said no negotiation.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:09.340]   You got you got to pay the link and Google said, no, we don't.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.340]   Goodbye Spain.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:11.340]   Are you even there?
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:12.340]   Cheese.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:13.340]   What you saying for in Spain?
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:14.340]   No, or a war.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.140]   No, you don't say no.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:19.540]   So you see, they said goodbye Spain.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.540]   And so.
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:21.540]   Adios.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:25.540]   They said they said, I'll feeders and Spain.
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:26.540]   Adios.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:32.940]   And so they left and the news publishers, you know, come up your nose to spite your face
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:33.940]   were hurt by it.
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:34.940]   They all lost traffic.
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:37.500]   But Spain was being stubborn about it.
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:42.300]   Then the EU came along and created its version of the Leistunguschlstrecht.
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.700]   I just love saying it every time I can.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:47.860]   And it allows negotiation.
[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:55.780]   So Spain, because it's in the EU, just adopted 13 and 15 of the or 15 and 17 articles of
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.940]   the EU copyright law.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:03.100]   And thus because negotiation is allowed, Google just announced we're coming back Spain.
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:05.620]   What else is?
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:08.300]   So they did announce their plan is to return the last night.
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.300]   Yes, they have a.
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:13.380]   I saw it for debate is the way I didn't see the follow up.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.380]   Great.
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:15.380]   So they said we're in.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:18.460]   And I suspect the web summit was this week.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:22.980]   God knows why anyone will go to a place with 40,000 people.
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:31.500]   But I suspect it was timed to that so the Google come in on a triumphant horse saying we return.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.980]   We're back.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:34.780]   We're back.
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:38.540]   Meanwhile, Australia is being stupid.
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:44.020]   And it's trying to tell Google to unbundle search from Android, which is just like, can
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:51.380]   you do a little history here about the EU and Microsoft and the browser, but fine, whatever.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:54.140]   They'll feel like they're big and important.
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:56.140]   And did.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:57.140]   Cool.
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:03.140]   So there's a lot of stuff.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.140]   But you're right.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:07.380]   The things that stood up were Facebook.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:13.300]   You know, if Gina were here, we'd talk about the return of wave from Microsoft.
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.300]   Right.
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:19.580]   They have a wave competitor or it looks like it anyways.
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:20.820]   I didn't put the story in here.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.140]   But when I was looking through it, what is it called?
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:24.700]   Microsoft Loop.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:27.900]   And just kind of put a little smile on my face.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.060]   It's live collaboration.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:30.060]   It's wave.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:34.820]   Yeah, it really looks a lot like it too.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.700]   It looks like it could have been the evolution of it anyways.
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.940]   All right.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:44.740]   Well, barring any other story, one other story.
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:52.660]   Yeah, go for it, which was that Hertz announced they were buying thousands of Teslas Tesla
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660]   stock.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:55.580]   100,000 cars.
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:42:04.500]   Tesla stock with skyrocketing must became wildly richer than he already was.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:08.780]   But then Musk came around and said, no, no, no, no, no, we didn't do any deal.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:13.580]   We're not doing, they're paying the same rate that consumers pay because his number one,
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:17.540]   his supply chain is slowed up.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:20.620]   So he doesn't want to act like he can't sell the car to consumers because they're all going
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:21.620]   to Hertz number one.
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:22.620]   Number two.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:28.780]   Well, I didn't realize is that car manufacturers don't want to admit selling cars to the rental
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.740]   companies because it's a gross deal that reduces the brand.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:37.500]   So here you have Hertz saying 100,000 and people saying, oh, good, this will make electric
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.500]   cars really popular.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:39.500]   That's great.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:45.340]   And then Musk being the usual fart at the dinner party comes in in his way and says,
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.900]   oh, so who knows what's true here?
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:48.900]   I found that interesting.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:56.460]   So Hertz said they were going to, and they were going to offer 100,000 Teslas by the end
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.940]   of 2022.
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:02.700]   And Elon Musk was like, no, we don't have a deal.
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:09.260]   And people, they do get upset partially because a lot of people have pre-ordered their freaking
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:12.060]   Teslas and probably are like, right.
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.060]   Hello.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:16.060]   You have some of my money.
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:17.060]   Right.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:23.220]   So car manufacturers selling to the rental services that cheapens their brand.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:24.220]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:26.460]   A couple of reasons.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:34.420]   One is because there's a lot, you know, I'm in the national emerald club or whatever it
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:37.660]   is where you can go and pick cars.
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:44.500]   There's a lot of brands you'd never ever see there because it's too plebeian to be picked
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:45.500]   that way.
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:51.180]   A, B, the models they order are always stripped down.
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:55.180]   And the manufacturer of a higher end car would rather have you see the super duper car
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:56.180]   with all the stuff.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:57.180]   And so they don't.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:58.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:43:59.180]   Got it.
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.180]   I thought it was.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:01.180]   Okay.
[01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:05.660]   Elon Musk didn't even put cup holders in the backseat of his first freaking Teslas.
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.820]   So let's talk about stripped down.
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:15.020]   By the way, me ask you, Stacy, what a lot of people do, more people do subscribe to your
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.780]   newsletter, just despite me from what I've been a joke before.
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:18.780]   And you're rich.
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:19.780]   I tell you rich.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:20.780]   Would you buy?
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:22.980]   Are you looking that you replace your phones?
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:24.100]   Are you looking to replace your Tesla?
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.740]   How long is that just the last for you?
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:27.740]   Well, let's see.
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:32.380]   We got it in 2015, September of 2015.
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.340]   Given what's going on in the world, I don't foresee me replacing it for another year or
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:40.740]   two, just because that doesn't make economic sense.
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.580]   And then my daughter is 15, so she'll start driving, but we're not going to get her a
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:50.400]   car until she leaves for college, if she even needs one for college, because we both
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400]   work from home.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.620]   It makes sense.
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:45:00.640]   Would you get a Tesla or would you say there's, you'd be looking at other, because there's
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.380]   so many other electrical choices out there.
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:06.800]   I would 100% get an electric car.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.220]   Teslas are super fun to drive still, but there are other fun cars to drive that are
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:12.220]   electric.
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:16.420]   So my options are much, I mean, when I bought my car, I wanted an electric and I wanted
[01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:18.300]   it to be as fun as possible.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:23.840]   Like, in Tesla, which just blew me away based on the two other cars that were available
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.760]   at the time.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:29.360]   So I would definitely look at it.
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.360]   I've liked it.
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.360]   I probably wouldn't buy my car anymore though.
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.960]   If I bought an electric car, it probably leaves it.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:42.720]   It doesn't make sense to buy based on the kind of technology that's in cars now.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.720]   Yeah, right.
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.720]   And the software.
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.720]   It's a negative support.
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.720]   It's a great software.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:53.720]   It just ages out so quickly.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:59.720]   Yeah, we just got, I mean, I just replaced my 3G modem in my car with a 4G modem.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:05.720]   But, you know, I can't, I can't upgrade to all the cool software features, like autopilot
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:07.720]   features that, and people assume that.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:12.720]   That's the other thing when you're driving people like, okay, I backed it to someone accidentally
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.720]   at the grocery store.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:14.720]   You do that.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.200]   I was like, okay, actually my car is not.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:20.200]   Assumptions.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.480]   Yeah, right.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:28.320]   That's a really interesting point that I had not considered is that cars prior to electric
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:32.000]   were, cars now really are, you know, more and more.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.800]   They're computers, you know, with wheels.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.600]   And you know, legacy vehicles that lasted, you know, decades, you know, if you're, if
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.720]   you're nice to them.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:48.400]   Yeah, I just hadn't considered the fact that it may have made more sense to buy outright
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:54.840]   older kind of style vehicles, but these newer style vehicles with the need to upgrade and
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:57.280]   the way and the parts that get upgraded.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.840]   Like, I've never considered lease before.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.080]   I've always thought like a lease was kind of throwing money away.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:08.880]   And we are definitely, we are definitely in the realm of considering because we just got
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.200]   solar on the house, we got it with an electric vehicle in mind.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.400]   So we want to be able to charge it here.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:19.200]   So I mean, we're within, I'd say a couple of years of getting an electric vehicle to
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.320]   replace one of ours.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.800]   And I don't know that we had even considered leasing, but that's, that's a really interesting
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:25.800]   point.
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.640]   So Jason, I screwed up to look into that.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:28.640]   Leave it to me to do this.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:33.480]   We had, we had a sob 9000 back when the, oh, those were the days, which we loved.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.280]   We adored that car.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:41.600]   And so then decided to get another one and lease and I wanted, I, I negotiated like hell
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.240]   to make sure that I get a longer lease because I loved this car and GM had taken over a sob
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.640]   and it was crap and I was stuck with it.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:51.920]   I could not get rid of the car for four years.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:57.280]   So you are, you know, you do have a lease, you give up a little control with the lease
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   too.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.280]   Right.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.280]   Right.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.280]   Yeah, you do.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.480]   I mean, there's, there's pros and cons, but like we always bought used cars.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.960]   I even bought a used Tesla, right?
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.200]   Because the car depreciates so much coming off.
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:12.920]   So it still depreciates so much driving off the lot.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:16.200]   And yet for resale, barring the pandemic.
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:20.480]   So this is a weird time because you can resell your car really well actually.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:28.280]   You know, the appreciation value of, you know, a five year old computer is tremendous compared
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.960]   to buying it new or buying just a, even two year old computer.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:33.960]   Right.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.440]   So that's one issue.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:40.840]   There was something else about cars that I was trying to think of, but I can't.
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.800]   They go fast.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:43.800]   I don't know.
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.960]   I don't know what your other thing was, but they do go fast.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.960]   They do go fast.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:53.440]   Oh, insurance companies, they're so expensive to repair.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:58.480]   So as we turn them into theaters, they're becoming so much more expensive to repair and
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:05.440]   insurance on them rises, but also the ability to total a perfectly fine working car is
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.440]   crazy.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:10.800]   Now you could have, you know, with all the sensors in a mirror plus a bumper, that could
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.000]   total a new car.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.720]   I mean, it just, they're not an asset that retains its value like they used to.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:18.720]   That's interesting.
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:21.160]   Well, I would more each day.
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.600]   I sort of wish I had a motorcycle or a scooter, but yeah, right.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.280]   It wouldn't be ideal for me to have a scooter to go back and forth from the scooter here
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:36.160]   to the studio, but just putting around the neighborhood or whatever scooter would totally
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.040]   work because I sometimes I don't want to drive my car, especially when I look out and see
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:46.040]   that it's almost $5 a gallon for petrol is just it kills petrol.
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.040]   Petrol?
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.040]   Where are you from?
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.040]   Petrol.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:50.040]   Petrol.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:51.840]   I was wondering if anyone would catch that.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.240]   Because I'm not supposed to say gas, right?
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.760]   You're acting posh.
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:03.800]   And I really found out recently what that meant posh.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:04.900]   Posh.
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:09.880]   I think what you actually need to get instead of a motorcycle is what Matthew Ingram last
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:14.000]   week's guest had as the Jetson one.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.240]   That's what you need to get the ultra light.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:22.040]   Stacey, it's a four engine personal helicopter.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.520]   Oh, nice.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:26.520]   You don't need a light car to fly it.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:27.520]   I drew a car.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.280]   It's a drone car, basically.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.280]   92,000 dollars.
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:31.520]   Do we need to do the change log?
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.000]   Yeah, we need to do the change log.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000]   Should we do that now?
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000]   Sorry.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000]   Let's do it.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.360]   No, no, I just was like, where am I?
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.360]   It wasn't your fault, Ant.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:41.120]   No, wasn't your fault at all.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.320]   This show goes where it goes.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.480]   And right now it's going to the change log.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:48.720]   The Google change log.
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:57.000]   All right, we got some stories in the change log starting with Google Fi apparently about
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:04.840]   to get encrypted and encrypted phone calls between five between two Android phones on
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:05.840]   five.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.800]   So both users need to be on fire in order for the phone calls to be encrypted.
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:13.160]   But apparently spies will fly.
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:14.160]   There you go.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.160]   Yes.
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.160]   There's spies.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:17.960]   It kind of has a nice ring.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:21.640]   That could be a promotion at the day at some point.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.680]   There we go for that.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:26.120]   Okay, Android 12 beta program.
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:27.360]   Oh, that's right.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.360]   That's right.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:29.360]   Sorry.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:30.360]   I'm getting ahead of myself.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.440]   November security update is rolling out two pixel devices.
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:35.600]   That includes the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:41.000]   It addresses some deals or some issues with the phone.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:48.040]   So the thing to remember here is that if you are enrolled for the beta program for Android
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:50.600]   12, you're not going to get the November update.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:55.880]   So you need to do it to unenroll yourself and you'll get that November security update.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:52:00.440]   The reason that you have to do it this time and you didn't before is because of the Android
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.200]   12L update that we talked about last week.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:06.760]   That's going to be the beta for that is going to start next month.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.840]   So the idea is if you stay signed up for the beta next month, you'll start to get the
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:15.120]   Android 12L beta releases until that's released.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:20.280]   If you unenroll, then you'll be on the regular Android 12 track and you'll get the security
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:25.280]   patches starting with the November one that just came out.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:33.280]   And it should be noted that Pixel 3, I think, is almost at the end of its life as far as
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.560]   updates are concerned.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:40.520]   It was only supposed to get updates until October 2021.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:47.040]   It's still got Android 12, so in some ways you can consider yourself getting an extra
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.200]   update than it probably was supposed to.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:53.120]   You're going to get one final update sometime in Q1.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:56.880]   But keep that in mind if you have the Pixel 3, you're not going to get any more security
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:03.160]   updates out after the last one in Q1.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.160]   Let's see here.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.200]   There is a Google Chrome update, I guess, that is coming out.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.520]   I feel like there's Chrome updates every other week.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.720]   All the time to six, zero days.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:14.680]   Yes, Steve Gibson was actually just talking about this yesterday.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:18.760]   I was on security now with Steve and he was talking all about just the insane amount
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:22.960]   of zero days that Chrome has been seeing week and after.
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.720]   And every time there's one of these, yeah, every time there's one of these GD Forbes says,
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.840]   "This is why you must delete Chrome."
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:34.200]   And the core of this is good.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.280]   Of all these media places trying to tell you why you should delete something because something
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.520]   went wrong for a day.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.560]   And ZDNet has fallen into this trap.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:43.560]   Forbes is bad at this.
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:47.600]   I'm being driven nuts by the former press.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:50.160]   It's now become nothing but click-blade land.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:53.000]   And it's awful.
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.120]   Indeed.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:58.920]   So look for that update.
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:00.680]   Just always look for a Google Chrome update.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:02.280]   It's probably fixing something.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.760]   It's probably a good idea to get it regardless.
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:10.400]   But apparently there's some zero-date tax that it's fixing there as well.
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.400]   This is interesting.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:12.400]   Chromecast.
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.360]   So if you remember with Chromecast and you have something playing, maybe you're casting
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.200]   to a TV or whatever, when you use the volume buttons on your phone, it would change the
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.360]   volume that the Chromecast is playing back at.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.600]   Well, apparently those volume controls have been disabled on Android 12.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:33.640]   And more and more people were complaining about this thinking that it's a bug.
[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:35.680]   It turns out it's not a bug.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:43.560]   Google has needed to disable this functionality because it's citing legal issue essentially.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:49.080]   They wouldn't really elaborate on exactly what it is.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:55.680]   This article 9 to 5 Google kind of questions if maybe it has something to do with patents
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:56.680]   by Sonos.
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:01.960]   There's a lawsuit that's been underway since early last year.
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.480]   So maybe it has something to do with that.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.520]   But Google has said they're working on a fix.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:10.000]   They've got a solution for this and it'll come back probably included in the next version
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.760]   of Android 12, which is going to be 12L.
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:18.320]   But in the meantime, your volume buttons aren't going to work on your Chromecast.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.080]   Actually, I think it might be this final tap has the patent there.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.080]   You can't go to 11.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:24.840]   Unless you get there.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.760]   Well, at least let us turn it up to 10 then.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:29.760]   You know why?
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.760]   Exactly.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.960]   If it's 11, it's 11.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.160]   No one needs 11.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:37.240]   Let's see here.
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.120]   Assistant smart displays are I don't have one of these.
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:42.920]   So I've never run into this.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:46.120]   But apparently you used to be able to make all sorts of calls on it.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:48.840]   And now it's going to be limited to just your contacts.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:53.480]   I don't know if this has to do with like dialing, you know, wrong numbers or something.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.320]   Is this something that you've used?
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.320]   You could dial.
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:59.920]   You could actually call like restaurants and stuff to see if they were open or something.
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:02.320]   Oh, which would be useful.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:03.320]   Super useful.
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.520]   I hope they're not getting rid of that.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.520]   But if it's your contacts, that makes it seem like, yeah, you probably wouldn't be able
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:08.520]   to do that.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.920]   Who puts the restaurant in their contacts?
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.960]   Because you could always have a nice restaurant.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.880]   You didn't need to do the contacts.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:16.320]   That new Indian place moved down the street.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:19.440]   I should add that to my contacts so I can call it through my nest up like no one's going
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:20.440]   to do that.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:26.320]   No, actually, I have the I have our local Mexican food place.
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.920]   Well, same here.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:29.920]   I have two contacts for restaurants.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:32.120]   And I will use those smart devices.
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.400]   Yeah, that's different than what I'm saying though.
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.720]   What I'm saying is if there's a new place that moved in downtown, I'm not going to add
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:39.720]   them to my contacts just to call them.
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:40.720]   Okay, I'm just thinking.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:42.960]   But if it's a place you love, absolutely.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:43.960]   I've done that too.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:44.960]   Yes.
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.960]   Gotcha.
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:46.960]   Gotcha.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.960]   But I don't think he's online.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:50.960]   Right.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:55.520]   I got this offer in the mail, Google One users in four countries.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:02.320]   Now have the offer to get a free second gen nest hub if you upgrade to their two terabyte
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.040]   annual plan.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.840]   So that's the $99.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:09.240]   Well, it's $100 a year for that plan.
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:15.240]   So you would save 17% compared to paying $10 every month.
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:18.840]   And that would ultimately make the nest hub free if you did that.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:19.840]   So.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.560]   And this is part of Google's.
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:26.160]   Let us give you stuff to sign up for our recurring revenue services.
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.160]   Totally, totally.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:34.480]   Let's and also let's let us have the stuff that we give you be conduits in your home
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.280]   to more of our stuff, right?
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.360]   Like here's the nest hub and now said there's a lot in.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:44.960]   And eventually they're going to launch a subscription for sleep and wellness from that thing because
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.000]   that's the nest hub that does the solely sensory.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.560]   Oh, that's right.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:55.440]   Yeah, I've got the 200 gig plan of Google One.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.440]   So it's like three bucks a month.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.520]   So this would be a step up.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.760]   I don't know that I necessarily need two terabytes of Google Cloud storage.
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:05.200]   And does if you shoot those raw images.
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.200]   Good.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.760]   I have two terabytes.
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.120]   You do.
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:12.080]   So I wonder if you is this only for upgrades?
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:15.080]   Oh, must be only for upgrading upgrades.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:19.080]   I don't know why they do it.
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.080]   Otherwise.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:25.680]   And then finally, Jekard, if you remember Jekard from years ago, Google I/O, it was
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:32.600]   the technology that was embedded into the fabric, showed off on Levi's jackets and stuff.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:39.480]   And apparently the Jekard SDK is going to be released by Google so that devs can make
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:42.200]   their own smart fabric apps.
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:44.760]   You can buy the Levi's Jekard jacket.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:48.400]   You can also buy a backpack from is it Mark Jacob?
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:49.400]   Samsonite.
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:50.400]   Samsonite.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.400]   Samsonite.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:55.760]   No, Saint Lauren and Samsonite both have backpacks.
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:56.760]   Okay.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:58.760]   Someone fancy.
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:58:59.760]   Santa Hall.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:03.760]   And Sam's tonight.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:04.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:07.760]   So those are the real.
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:08.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:12.600]   You too could create apps for three things that exist in this world.
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:19.120]   I think Ikea, so I think Ikea should make a couch with Jekard fabric on the armrest.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.920]   So you can, as long as you can turn up the volume, I guess.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:27.120]   No, it's been disabled.
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:32.920]   I feel like that was one of the use cases or one of the examples that they showed off
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:33.920]   at Google I/O.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:35.280]   I specifically remember that.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:37.920]   I feel like maybe it was.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:41.840]   Or maybe people were just wishing for it, but I do remember that talking about that
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.840]   and going, actually, that would be pretty useful.
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:48.520]   Imagine if you bought your couch expecting it and then Google for legal issues had to
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:49.520]   turn it off.
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.800]   Oh, just took it away.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.880]   Wouldn't that part of the couch kind of get like dirty over time too?
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.600]   Because you're always like, Oh my God, it'd be so filthy.
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:00.160]   Yeah, it would be kind of gross.
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:06.360]   That's why it would have to be a denim couch because denim, it's okay if it gets dirty.
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.360]   You know what you could do?
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:11.360]   You could do the, you know, how like old people's couches have like slip covers over the things.
[02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:16.080]   You could put in a slip cover and then you could upgrade it over time and keep it.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:19.080]   Yeah, you could put a screen there with your TV guide.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:24.520]   Yes, just a size for the couch there.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:25.520]   There you go.
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:28.360]   George's father on, on Seinfeld.
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:32.280]   It would be like a screen protector for your couch.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:34.280]   Can I say?
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:35.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.280]   All right.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:39.440]   That's the Google change, change log.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.600]   We're at the end of that section.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:42.600]   There we go.
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:44.080]   So the horns.
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:45.920]   All right.
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:49.840]   We're going to get to tips, tricks and things and stuff.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:52.160]   We've got all that coming up next.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:55.360]   But first let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of this episode of This Week
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.960]   in Google brought to you by CashFly.
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:00.280]   No stranger to this network.
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:05.120]   We've been working with CashFly here at Twit for years, over 10 years actually.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.920]   CashFly is the CDN that's been innovating content delivery since 1999.
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:16.480]   CashFly now offers ultra low latency streaming and it's not the web RTC solution that's
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:17.680]   let you down in the past.
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:21.320]   Stream delays are less than one second.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:24.120]   But there's also a whole lot of other perks that come along with this.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:31.320]   They have the HTML5 player that offers easy support anywhere with SDK available for even
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:37.360]   better mobile support, whether you need your player to be running on a website or applications,
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:39.120]   mobile devices, really, it doesn't matter.
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:41.840]   Another platform they've got you covered.
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:49.320]   CashFly is the fastest CDN for throughput globally with over 50 points of presence distributed
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.480]   all over the world.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:52.120]   They're low latency network.
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:56.080]   Your video streams are going to be streaming quickly anywhere you happen to have viewers,
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.200]   regardless of what continent they're on.
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:03.400]   CashFly's ultra low latency video platform can deliver video to more than a million users
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:04.400]   concurrently.
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:08.440]   That's amazing as well as ingest thousands of synchronous streams.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:13.360]   Their platform is designed for transmuxing thousands of streams simultaneously with live
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:14.360]   failover.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:20.440]   They can ingest all the big EZRT, PRT, MPS, SRT and more to deliver ultra low latency
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.640]   SLDP and HLS streams at the same time.
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:25.640]   Super flexible.
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:30.080]   You get a custom built solution that's based on your unique needs and is built on top of
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:35.800]   their reliable, robust global network with ingest and delivery where you need it.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:42.240]   Best of all, they have 24/7, 365 day support, priority support in fact.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.320]   You know that they're always going to be there for you when you need them.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:51.000]   CashFly's infrastructure can support more than one million concurrent streams today because
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.640]   of their reliable throughput and scalability.
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:57.200]   They're going to be up to five times faster than other CDNs.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.840]   It's the world's most reliable CDN backed by a 100% SLA.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:07.400]   CashFly is helping others in need and has partnered with World Central Kitchen in fact.
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:10.880]   They have a goal of serving 300,000 warm meals.
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.080]   So far they've already donated more than $50,000.
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:21.920]   And CashFly pioneered the first NCAS CDN infrastructure in 2002 and their best hop technology
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:27.280]   actually automatically finds the fastest route to and from customer origin across their global
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:33.080]   network of POPS for maximum performance and reliability.
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:34.360]   And I mean the proofs in the pudding.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:41.000]   If you've been following and watching and listening to Twit over the years, you've undoubtedly
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.840]   you've experienced the awesomeness of CashFly delivering you our media quickly and it doesn't
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:50.320]   matter where you are, it comes to you fast.

[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:24.560]   Alright, so let's do tips, tricks and things and Stacy, you're back so we'll take yours
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:25.560]   first.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:26.560]   What you got?
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:32.120]   Okay, I am telling you about the flick flick flick flick flick.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:33.120]   The flick twist.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.520]   Sorry, I was like, what's it called?
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.560]   Y'all are probably familiar and this is a Kickstarter.
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:41.920]   It won't ship till January, just letting you get all that out of the way.
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:45.040]   But it is a legit company shortcut labs that makes it.
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:50.440]   So you should actually expect to receive this in a reasonable amount of time.
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:54.240]   So flick makes some really awesome smart buttons.
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:55.240]   They're nice.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:59.880]   They're Bluetooth based and they have a hub, the flick hub that extends that beyond Bluetooth
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:01.720]   range and your smartphone.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:04.760]   And you can use it to control so many things in your house.
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:09.200]   Why is there a blood splattering with a thermostat thing?
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:11.160]   Oh, back up.
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:12.720]   What are you talking about?
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.560]   The video has blood splattering in a stick about a thermostat.
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:19.040]   What's going on here?
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.200]   Oh, you know, it's just Halloween.
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.440]   Yeah, who does?
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.080]   Yeah, it's spooky.
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:26.080]   Okay.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.000]   The twist is the very Asian.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.960]   I'm like, I don't know, Jeff.
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:32.120]   Okay, I'm sorry, but I couldn't figure it.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:34.320]   But it confused me, Stacy.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:35.320]   Okay.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:38.680]   Well, I watched the video like a week and a half ago.
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:40.680]   I don't know.
[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:41.680]   Oh, you're right.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:42.680]   The very first frame.
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:51.000]   It's like the twist and it's a blood splatter on the floor.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.560]   It's a good question.
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.560]   It's a good question.
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:54.560]   That's a good question.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:55.560]   It's a good question.
[02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:56.560]   It's a good question today on showtime.
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:57.560]   I'll go ahead and back you up, Jeff.
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:58.560]   That's a questionable first frame for your product.
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:05:59.560]   Yeah, it is.
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:00.560]   It is.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:01.560]   Yeah.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:02.560]   What is this possibly going to have to do?
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:03.560]   They're killing something.
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:05.960]   That's a sell-up-frame thing to start things off with.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:06.960]   Yeah, it is.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:07.960]   It is.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:08.960]   I just want to.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:09.960]   I'm not nuts here.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:11.200]   I said, "Well, it's the Dexter."
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:15.440]   So it's somehow doing the IOT of Dexter on IOT.
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.160]   It's not making any sense.
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:19.440]   So I just didn't get it.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.520]   Thank you very much, Jason, showing up now.
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:25.800]   And Stacy's still irritated with me because she's getting hungrier and she wants to go.
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:26.800]   I am hungry.
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:27.800]   I'm like a good person.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:28.800]   I lost my appetite.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:29.800]   So here we go.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:30.800]   All right.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:31.800]   All right.
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:36.920]   Jason mentioned pudding, so I'm ready as in the proof is in.
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:38.480]   Okay.
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:40.880]   So the flick twist is a variation on the button.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:46.120]   You've got 14 options of things to do because you've added instead of just a short press
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:47.480]   and a long press.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.960]   Now you have twists.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.280]   You have 12 twists.
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:54.440]   I think the big challenge that we're going to see with this device, which does look admittedly
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:58.240]   pretty cool, is the fact that there are 14 things you can do.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:01.280]   I can't imagine remembering all 14 of them.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:04.000]   But they're working on that.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.240]   Anyway, I do think it's kind of neat.
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:09.840]   It's 79 euros for early birds.
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:13.520]   It's about 92 bucks for this one thing.
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:18.440]   I would imagine putting two in your home if you were in love with this concept for like
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:21.360]   a master switch upstairs and downstairs.
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:24.960]   But like I could also see it on my, you can use it to control apps too.
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:33.120]   So I could use it on my desk to control like all my lights for my video setup or, you know,
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:34.120]   other things.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:37.280]   I don't know if I'd have full 14, but I'd have a lot.
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:39.720]   I could turn the thermostat down from my desk.
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:42.160]   Oh, now I'm one for my desk.
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:44.760]   But if you get this, it is still Bluetooth.
[02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:50.600]   So be aware that you'll need the hub if you want it to work outside of the range of your
[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:56.520]   smartphone or the device that it's supposed to be working with.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.760]   And that is the information about that.
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:07:59.760]   It's a neat.
[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.640]   I mean, I love buttons and I love the flick buttons.
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:06.840]   So I am like right up here in the target market for that.
[02:08:06.840 --> 02:08:09.520]   And how do you feel about twisty buttons?
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:10.960]   I love twisty buttons.
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:11.960]   Well, it depends.
[02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:16.240]   Do they click like the saddest thing about the nest and their like cheaper redesigns is
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:17.240]   they got away.
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:22.440]   They did away with the physical click and I was like, Oh, yeah, I know it's cheaper, but
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:26.320]   Yeah, there's something there's something satisfying.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.320]   Yeah.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:29.520]   Yeah, indeed the flick twist.
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:34.520]   So I don't know if this is a clickies or not.
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.720]   Yeah, hard to know.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:40.800]   Kind of, yeah, you mentioned the nest.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:44.160]   It kind of has a nest thermostat quality to it.
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:45.160]   Kind of look to it.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:47.320]   Yeah, it's bigger than the buttons are small.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:52.560]   They're like this big, but I wish I had a button running around to show you, but I think
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:54.560]   and I have it.
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:56.720]   So 41 days to go.
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:09:02.280]   If you want to back this and get it, who knows when you can there you go.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:03.640]   It's on Kickstarter.
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:04.640]   Cool.
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:07.080]   Jeff, what's your stuff or your number?
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:11.440]   I'm going to do just things disgusting food things things that will bother you with food.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:13.640]   Number one is line 149.
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:15.920]   I'm jealous of this as hell.
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:21.080]   Somebody had a Taco Bell wedding and the best thing.
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.800]   They had beef Wellington and they chose Taco Bell Taco Bell.
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:35.880]   The best thing is they made a bouquet for them out of sauce packs.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.240]   I hope they got paid so much.
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:42.040]   Well, so then I went looking into this because of course this was fascinating.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:44.640]   I'm already married, so I can't do it again.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:47.160]   But nor do I want to do that.
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:48.160]   You can remarry it.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:49.160]   I mean, you could never do that.
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.920]   You can do renew your vows.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:52.640]   Renew your vows to Taco Bell.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:55.200]   Certainly not do this.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.320]   So if you go to the pictures there on that story, you can see them there.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.200]   It's going to be eating a cake together.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:04.000]   They're eating a taco together over the sauce packet.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:11.360]   Do you need to do the churros or the cinnatwist?
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:13.280]   What the hell did they call their churros?
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:14.280]   I don't know.
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:15.280]   They did the taco because it's a taco place.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:16.280]   It's Taco Bell.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:17.280]   You want to put your churros.
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:19.520]   I know, but Taco Bell has the cinnatwist things.
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:21.280]   Someone in the chat, please help me.
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:22.280]   What are those called?
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:23.280]   Churros.
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:24.280]   Churros.
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:25.280]   Yes, cinnatwist.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:26.280]   They were called.
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.880]   Well, anyway, so there are these beautiful sauce packet things.
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:30.680]   I'm asking you, Jeff.
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:32.680]   You're going to believe me now, yes.
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:36.160]   If we go to the next line down, it turns out it's the thing.
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.640]   And there's a company that offers Taco Bell weddings.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:42.400]   And they have their own kind of little chapel there.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:46.160]   And if you scroll down there as well, now that we're there, you're going to see that
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:53.240]   they offer you wedding's Taco Bell wedding swag and the sauce packet hub bouquet and
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:58.400]   a sauce packet bow tie and Taco Bell.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:03.960]   Oh, oh, it's a taco twelve pack on your way out of the chapel.
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:06.720]   Yeah, this is unbelievable.
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:07.720]   And then there's three.
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:09.320]   There's three weddings below that.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:12.520]   There's three testimonials.
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:13.520]   There are more.
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:14.520]   There are six whole weddings here.
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:15.520]   Is that what you're telling us now?
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:20.520]   I'm just going to say there's three testimonials from the three couples who have ever done this.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:25.520]   Hey, this is nuts.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:26.520]   What?
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:29.520]   Hey, you know, what this sauce pack I'd be wearing.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:31.520]   All right, so that's one.
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:36.720]   I got, but, but you know, before you move on, before you move on though, would the bouquet
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:41.400]   toss just be really careful that bouquet is made out of Taco Bell sauce packets gets too
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:42.400]   rough.
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:45.280]   That Taco Bell sauce is going everywhere.
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.080]   And I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:49.480]   I guess it depends on how much you love Taco Bell.
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:50.480]   It's just a warning.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:53.760]   Yeah, they have a Taco Bell sauce pack garter.
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:56.240]   You can throw that too.
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:58.040]   All right.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.040]   Now we have online 152 or we have played this video or not because it's going to rot if
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:04.040]   we can't play 152.
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:05.040]   Is it tick tock?
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:07.040]   Is that possible?
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.040]   I think so.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:11.560]   I don't know whether we can't get atrocity to food.
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.560]   It's mac and cheese.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:19.080]   Okay, well, that's that's the line above the line below has the actual video on 39 152
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:20.400]   has the actual video.
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:21.560]   What's got what's having to it.
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:22.560]   So look at this.
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:30.760]   They put in a slab of cheese macaroni cream pepper cheese and then they bake it.
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.520]   But it gets worse.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:37.640]   They get it out and then you smoosh up the slab of cheese with all the macaroni.
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:40.160]   Okay, that's kind of disgusting enough.
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:41.920]   And then they put raisins on there.
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:42.920]   What no raisins.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:43.920]   Raisins.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:45.960]   That's the atrocity.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:47.760]   Who would do that?
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:53.040]   I mean, everybody in TikTok's bacon cheese, the big for sand, big feta, big this.
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:56.000]   Yeah, they're all doing that part.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.720]   The audience sounding a little weird.
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:04.000]   It almost sounds like he's running Linux on his machine.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.720]   I mean, it actually does sound like exactly that.
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.160]   I was just working on the best of and that's in the best of.
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:12.400]   I got reacquainted with that clip.
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:14.320]   Let's go to terminal that.
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:17.040]   Yeah, switch terminal.
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:18.040]   That was disgusting.
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:19.360]   Putting raisins in your mac and cheese.
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.200]   I've never heard of that before.
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:24.440]   I can't imagine that tastes good.
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:25.440]   I do not believe.
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:29.520]   My wife thinks that raisins are a conspiracy on their own.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:33.400]   They're only meant to hide in foods and surprise you in unpleasant ways.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:36.480]   I either have like raisins and I get scones with the way it's doing.
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.000]   And she thinks I'm insane.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.000]   I like your girls.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000]   Raisins are OK.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000]   Raisins are good.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.000]   They're OK.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.520]   Raisins are fine on their own.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:48.160]   But when they're like, they just spoil baked goods like little palaces.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:50.160]   They're like my wife.
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:51.160]   Yeah.
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:52.920]   I mean, I can understand that.
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.120]   All the raisins that could be found inside of like a trail mix like with nuts and M&M.
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:13:59.120]   Those are exceptions.
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:00.880]   There's also raisins in there.
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:01.880]   Totally game.
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:02.880]   Totally game.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:08.440]   That's Stacy, a raisin scone.
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.440]   Look at her face.
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:14.040]   You know what I have for breakfast every day since the pandemic started?
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:16.040]   I have dry raisin.
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:17.040]   Dry raisin.
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:18.040]   I don't like raisin.
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:23.000]   Who would put milk and cereal and make it all soggy that never made any sense to me.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000]   Where he's never made.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000]   Okay.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000]   Raisin.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.000]   Dry.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000]   Dry raisin.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000]   I eat brand flakes.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.640]   You know what?
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:32.640]   Have your ketchup.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.440]   That sounds like punishment.
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:35.440]   It's torture.
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:37.840]   Yeah, that doesn't sound delicious.
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:41.720]   Although I do remember it's been a long time since I've had raisin brand.
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:46.320]   I do remember raisin brand was very susceptible to getting really mushy with milk.
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.720]   So yeah, it makes sense.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:48.720]   Why would you?
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:50.920]   I don't get put it in a milk and make it.
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.000]   Why would you eat raisin brand?
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000]   Mix it palatable.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]   Yeah, I think that's where I ended up.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.440]   It's not how can I how can I continue to eat raisin brand?
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:01.040]   It's like I don't like it with milk.
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:02.720]   You know, there's nothing now.
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:03.720]   It's okay.
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.720]   There's so many delicious breakfast foods out there.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:06.720]   I'm out.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:07.720]   I'm out.
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:08.720]   I don't need anymore.
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:10.760]   That don't need you raisin brand.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.920]   Yeah, what you got?
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.960]   Well my pick man floss weekly.
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:18.960]   That's my first one.
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:19.960]   Floss weekly.
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.360]   These last couple of weeks these episodes have been just tremendous with doc circles and
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:27.520]   the rest of the floss weekly host.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:36.840]   Today he sat with Paula Hunter of Moduloop and they talked about just the state of financial
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:46.000]   inclusion and transfer of money from banks to countries that are developing countries
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:53.760]   and the use of cryptocurrency and the difficulties between changing currency from this one to
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:54.760]   that one.
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:56.520]   That feature phones involve everybody.
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.480]   They don't have the best and the latest and greatest smartphone and all the challenges
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:01.960]   that comes along with that.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:06.840]   And it was just pretty just really interesting and they're going to do another discussion
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:11.640]   similar to that next week with another person from Moduloop.
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:17.560]   So it's pretty good stuff and doc and Sean were the host for this week's show.
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:21.840]   But next week I can't remember who's on but it's doc and somebody.
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.840]   But yeah floss weekly.
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:27.840]   Twit.tv/floss.
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:29.160]   Thanks.
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:33.560]   And then my other pick is Andre Mack.
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:38.840]   He used to have a YouTube channel but I don't think he's uploaded it uploaded to it for quite
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:43.880]   a while now but he's a part of Bon Appetit and I don't know how you all feel about Bon
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:48.800]   Appetit but their YouTube channel is pretty good and he's a Somali.
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:50.840]   I can never pronounce that properly.
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:54.920]   I got that but basically it talks about wine.
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:59.920]   And what I dig about him is he looks like me.
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:06.640]   He's a black dude and he's introducing wine and talking about the nuance of it because
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:11.520]   being in Sonoma County I need to learn about wine and especially if I get to hang out with
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:16.360]   Lisa Laport I need to know about wine because she knows her wine.
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:22.160]   It's been fascinating to try to learn more and he's been quite helpful and I'm still
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:29.320]   trying to get my palate to be as defined as his and figure out the differences between
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:30.320]   different wines.
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:31.320]   And I'm getting there.
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:37.400]   I'm better with whiskey but wine has been a bit more challenging but it's also been fun.
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:41.600]   You've had practice with whiskey before you moved to the Bay Area were you much of a wine
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:43.800]   drinker at all or is this kind of a new thing?
[02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:45.320]   Yeah this is all new to me.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.680]   I would have it if someone offered it to me but I never just went out and bought it but
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:52.800]   now I will go out and buy a pin on the wire now.
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:53.800]   Yeah.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:54.800]   Yeah right on.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.800]   Yeah.
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:57.560]   There's a lot of dimension to wine.
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:00.120]   It's a cool rabbit hole to jump down.
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:05.840]   I mean as with so many things I mean bourbon whiskey included.
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:07.480]   Tequila I found that with tequila.
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:10.520]   I always thought tequila was just tequila.
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.200]   Oh that's the liquor that you drink when you want to get really wasted or whatever.
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:20.640]   And then I ended up working at a restaurant years and years ago that it's one of its specialties
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:23.440]   was that it had just had this killer tequila bar.
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:27.240]   Tons of different types of tequila and that was a total education working there.
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:32.960]   I was like whoa there is dimension and depth to tequila that I didn't know existed.
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:37.320]   You can just sip on its own and yeah it was just really cool.
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:39.640]   You can find that in a lot of that kind of stuff.
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:45.640]   Yeah Queen Permit likes tequila and our neighbors had to sort of educate her to say hey no this
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:46.840]   is not tequila.
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.920]   This is tequila and give her something that's you know much better and it's night and day
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:52.920]   in the taste.
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:53.920]   I'm not a tequila fan.
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:57.320]   Big control substance.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.920]   I'm much rather a mess gal versus tequila but it's there.
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:05.160]   I think it tastes like all the smoky stuff tastes like band-aids.
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:07.640]   Yeah I'm with you Stacey.
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:10.800]   I much prefer like a good tequila over mess gal.
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:12.480]   Mascale has too much of that smokiness.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:13.480]   It's hard for me.
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:14.720]   I try so hard.
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:17.280]   I can do a little of it but I'm just like.
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:18.280]   Yeah me too.
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:19.280]   Me too.
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:20.280]   Me too.
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:28.320]   Well okay Anthony Nielsen points out a discord tequila is Mascale technically.
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:32.560]   You're right but there's something about what's marketed as Mascale.
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:38.920]   That ends up having that overly smoky flavor that I just can't really get too deeply into.
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:40.520]   Thanks Anthony.
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:48.200]   Okay my tip is something I learned on the show last night on all about Android that
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:53.000]   an emailer sent in an email had heard me say on the show that I have never actually
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.480]   owned or used the Chromecast with Google TV.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:20:01.040]   We've talked about it a lot but I don't have one and I haven't bought one because we have
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:04.640]   Nvidia Shield TV in both of our rooms.
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:05.640]   Yeah.
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:08.920]   And an emailer I wish I wrote down his name I'm sorry.
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:13.320]   Wrote in to say hey you kind of can't afford not to have one because right now if you have
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:18.000]   a Netflix subscription already and even if you don't Google has a deal going on right
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:23.320]   now where they have a bundle with a Chromecast with Google TV and six months of Netflix for
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:31.000]   90 bucks which basically when you do the math it's something like what is it it's the Netflix
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:40.320]   value it's in here somewhere is $83 $84 applies to Netflix and so essentially you're getting
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:45.960]   the Chromecast with Google TV for five bucks that and so I have a Netflix account but it's
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:52.280]   not the standard version it's the 4K version so it's so the monthly fee is more but still
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:59.160]   this $84 would still apply to my Netflix account something that I'm already paying anyways
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:03.760]   and then the difference is the five or six dollars and you end up with a Chromecast with
[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:10.880]   Google TV which is a pretty darn good deal either way but you mentioned this earlier Stacey
[02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:17.520]   and I'm totally in this boat too as tempting as this is to do I kind of don't want to do
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:22.960]   it because I don't really need it like part of me thinks I might want to do it because
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:26.680]   just from the experience of using the product and we talk about these things in the network
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:31.920]   all the time so it could be a work opportunity to just be more familiar with it but it also
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:35.040]   kind of feels like a waste like I'd be getting this thing and then it hardly be using it
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:43.400]   don't buy it don't buy it have Google send you a review Chrome or buy one yeah right I
[02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:48.080]   mean don't don't insert do not into making only a personal business
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:58.600]   whatever it's not a good thing is someone who lives with me I just need to say someone
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:06.400]   who lives with all these devices and it has to deal with like yeah no I believe yes I'm
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:12.080]   right there with you it's a lot to manage at the same time if if someone out there has
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:16.640]   been looking to upgrade you know their home home setup and been thinking about a Chromecast
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:20.360]   with Google TV and you already have Netflix this is a really great opportunity to get
[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:25.360]   one for like six bucks that's ultimately what I'm going to a cheapo college student
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:31.600]   yeah off your Netflix account right right you are an adult go into the world we have changed
[02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:38.680]   the password that is one thing to remember about this is when you get it like you know
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:42.560]   someone might be inclined to get this and then take the like brand new Chromecast with
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:46.680]   Google TV and gift it to someone which is not a horrible idea except for the fact that I
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:50.680]   think in order for the the terms of this to complete I don't know if it's like you get
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:55.760]   a rebate or whatever it is you have to actually set up the count the Chromecast with your Google
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:00.720]   account but then once you do that that satisfies the requirement you can remove your account
[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:05.120]   and you could still gift it someone would be happy to get it I'm sure that college student
[02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:13.320]   probably wouldn't care so there you go true good take you yep and then well I already
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:20.160]   mentioned it but mauvember.com/m/jsonhowltwit and on Twitter @jsonhowl you can yell at
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:27.920]   me and say dude look at that stuff off your chin is that what happens you shave when you
[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:31.120]   get enough money or do you have to wait until the end of the month I think I have to wait
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.800]   until the end of the month but you start the month clean shave and that's the thing you
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:40.960]   started clean shave and you don't shave for the whole month and you just sort of watch
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:46.920]   and wait see what happens as we play your tail with your house face there this feels
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:52.080]   like a lazy way to be like I don't want to shave so I'll just say I'm doing it for charity
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:59.440]   I mean I'm not gonna lie it's it's a I mean it's not a laziness for me for me it's just
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:04.880]   really good day yeah I mean I don't I don't care shaving like I don't mind shaving because
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:09.560]   it's never difficult for me to shave it's actually really easy yeah it takes about two
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:19.000]   seconds yeah it really does not take me very long washcloth right no I do it with tweezers
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:26.320]   you know I just I don't have to find whole ten yeah that's it sorry by your good sports
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:33.000]   it's a great reason to to be lazy that's there's truth there all right we've reached
