[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.000]   I'll introduce first our regulars, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.680]   from CUNY, the city university of New York,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.520]   and blogger at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.400]   And the author of a fabulous book on Google.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.720]   I'm going to give you all the plugs now, Jeff.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.680]   What would Google do?
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   I've been upstage but properly solved.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.120]   You're going to get upstaged here in a second.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.840]   Well, it's a way--
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   Somebody who actually reported it.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.240]   As opposed to me, I just lather.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.920]   That laugh, of course, is Gina Trapani from Smartowear.org.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840]   Buzzmachine is Jeff, smartowear.org.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.280]   Hi, Gina, and think up.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.780]   Hi.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.760]   How's it going?
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.080]   I know it's going great.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.680]   Really glad to be here because we have a fantastic guest
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.840]   on the line, Mr. Steven Levy, who is an immortal.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.080]   In the computer book realm, he wrote The Classic Hackers,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.280]   which I'm very pleased and proud to say it was reissued
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.200]   by O'Reilly last year.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.160]   And I got an autograph copy in my little hot little hands.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.320]   One of my favorite books of all time.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.560]   Let the squing begin.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.840]   Let the squing begin.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.200]   [SCREAMING]
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.440]   And the new book is called In the Plex.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.080]   And it is, as you say, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720]   It is-- it reportage.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.560]   Steven, actually, the modern word, I guess,
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.600]   is it was embedded at Google.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.760]   Were you embedded at Google?
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.480]   Well, Sunday Grey.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.120]   I spent a lot of time there and got access to literally
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.400]   anyone I wanted to talk to.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.240]   That's nice.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.960]   That was amazing.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.640]   How come they were so helpful?
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.880]   I think a couple things.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.760]   One is they knew me.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.280]   I've been covering them a long time, almost as a start
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.160]   for when I was in Newsweek.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.240]   Also, I think that at this point,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.320]   they think they have to open up a little more.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   I think that they feel they've been maybe too secretive.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.000]   And now that a lot of trust issues have opened up,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.800]   they thought it was to their advantage to let someone in
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.040]   and explain how things went and a little more depth.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.160]   Do they try to strongarm you at all and convince you?
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.800]   Did they spin?
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.080]   Well, originally, Elliot Schreig, who was then
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.800]   the head of the PR when I was negotiating the terms here,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.240]   said that he--
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   He's not a Facebook label.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.320]   I know exactly.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.800]   If I gave Google approval over everything in the book,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.240]   they would give me a badge.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   But I thought that wasn't too good a deal.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.320]   So--
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.960]   You know--
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.520]   Good for you for turning that down.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.840]   Somebody's going to buy a book that's approved by Google.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.320]   What happened was kind of the opposite,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.400]   because I got so familiar with the place.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   And people knew that I was seeing things
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.080]   that journalists weren't allowed to see,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.920]   because everything was embargoed until the book came out.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   We would wind up gossiping very quickly into an interview.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.960]   And they would talk to me more like a peer than a journalist
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.880]   there.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.400]   So it turned out to be great that I was there so much.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.880]   And everyone knew that I was doing this inside book.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.800]   So they felt free to talk to me.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.600]   Yeah, that's what happens with cameras, too.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.040]   Eventually, people just get used to it,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.880]   and they kind of forget.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.360]   And they just--
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   And this has been several years, right?
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.560]   Steven, when did you start researching the book in earnest?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.520]   I started the intense research in June 2008.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.720]   So just by my start at Wired.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.040]   Right.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.080]   So it's been quite some time.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.800]   So folks were just used to having you around.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.960]   You were kind of one of them during all that time.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.680]   I mean, it shows in the book.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.800]   It just leave you there.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.760]   So we can keep talking.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.600]   It is great in the sense that you've got quotes,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.480]   you've got conversations, you've got stories about things
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.960]   that we were covering from the outside,
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.320]   from the inside looking in.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.040]   And that makes it so much fun and so interesting.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.760]   I have-- I confess I haven't finished the book.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.400]   I'm still about in the middle of it.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.280]   There is-- I should have gotten the audio book edition.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.480]   You didn't get to China chapter, yeah.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.520]   That's my favorite part.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.480]   Well, let's talk about it, because we were sitting here
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.400]   covering that from the outside.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.600]   And starting with that December-- infamous December meeting
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.680]   between Eric and Larry over what to do about China.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.320]   Were you--
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.820]   Right.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.840]   Are you about to privy to what was going on there?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.480]   Well, that was the end of it.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.120]   And I have to say that there were things they didn't let me in on.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.640]   And one thing is they didn't invite me into their war building.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.040]   They usually have war rooms to handle crises.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.160]   But in this case, they did a whole building of people
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.240]   in crisis mode after a break in 2009.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.720]   In late 2009.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.760]   But that was just the end of this long process,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.560]   which I felt was leading to their inevitable pullout anyway.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.840]   They got increasingly uncomfortable
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.960]   with the original terrible compromise they made to censor.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.440]   And there was actually-- after the Olympics in 2008,
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.760]   when China didn't let up, there was a rump group
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.640]   of executives within Google who started to urge them
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.840]   to reconsider the policy.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.560]   So this was stuff was going on even before that break in.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.680]   If they're heading in a break in,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.160]   are you thinking of a bit of critical mass?
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.080]   I don't think--
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.760]   I think eventually it would have.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   Some people Google disagree with me.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.080]   But it just got more and more untenable.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.480]   China kept asking for more and more and more.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.760]   And the competition with Baidu was always going to be tilted.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.720]   And there was cultural gaps on top of that.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   So I don't know.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.240]   Maybe they would have stumbled over for a longer period of time.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.200]   But certainly, there were a lot of people at Google
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.280]   that were increasingly unhappy with this compromise.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   They thought that they were going to change China.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.240]   They thought that the justification for this compromise
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.200]   of censoring the search engine was
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   that they would give more information to China.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.760]   And they would say when they censored things and people
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.800]   they felt would push back against the government.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   And then demand-- we knew our information.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.200]   Stop censoring Google.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.840]   But it went in the opposite direction.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.400]   China was actually asking them to censor the search engine
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.720]   outside of China and the Chinese language.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.840]   So if you searched in New York City for Tiananmen Square,
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.040]   you wouldn't get any information about the protests.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.000]   You would just get happy bureaucrats and tourists.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.680]   You know, it's kind of ironic because one of the things
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.080]   I learned in the book that I did not know
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.760]   was that Google was going to buy Skype.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.360]   Right.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.960]   What happened?
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.920]   They bought gizmo instead.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.280]   Yeah, when eBay wanted to move it,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.800]   Google was just about to buy it.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.160]   And they were having a meeting to give the final approval.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.120]   But one product manager, the guy who bought Grand Central
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.400]   and was developing Google Voice, a really colorful guy
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.600]   named Wesley Cham, devised a plan to sabotage the purchase
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.360]   during the meeting.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.960]   He sort of sandbagged it, made it look like he
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.480]   and other executives were on board.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.560]   He got Sergey on his side in Salar Commandry,
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.480]   who's a very powerful figure at Google
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.560]   with a lot of people who don't know.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.440]   And halfway through the meeting, he started pulling up
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.160]   all these questions and it turned out
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.040]   the questions had no answers, like who was going to take
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.680]   charge of it and other things.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.200]   And then he started pointing out all the negatives of it.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.520]   And by the end of the meeting, Sergey just said,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.760]   you know, this is terrible.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   And actually, here's the worst word than that.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.160]   And Eric said, that's it.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.480]   And by the end of the meeting, the purchase was tanked.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.000]   Well, we wouldn't have Skype 5, maybe, if it had happened.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.280]   And you sound great now, Jeff.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.720]   Thank you.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.040]   You're fix.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.720]   I have Google Voice if it happens.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.960]   Thank God we have Google Voice.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.120]   I love Google Voice.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.080]   Thank goodness for that.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.600]   I believed.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.200]   But you do describe their layer management style.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.400]   Larry and Sergey's management style is kind of ad hoc.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.480]   In fact, there's a quote in here I'd love to find.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.360]   That basically says that Larry is just shy
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.560]   and doesn't want to talk to anybody, has no people skills.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   And Sergey has people skills, but he is very arrogant
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   about people who are not as smart as he is.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.800]   Yeah, that was a quote from actually an ex-Googler about them.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.320]   And it's interesting.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.560]   Larry, he is not a very extroverted person.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.960]   But when he's in his comfort zone,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.160]   he's very articulate and fun even.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.720]   When you see him in those TGIFs, the meetings
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.760]   they have every Friday afternoon, where all the employees
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.200]   get to ask any question of Larry and Sergey
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.280]   and the other executives, he's very relaxed.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.480]   And he and Sergey banter.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.120]   It's almost like hope and Crosby makes jokes there.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.360]   So what do you-- this is out of the book,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.800]   but what do you think of Larry taking over--
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.120]   was that a shock when Eric Schmidt stepped down
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.360]   and Larry took over?
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.400]   It was a big shock.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.640]   It was someone besides Larry.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.000]   I'll tell you that.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.480]   I found out about this.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.800]   Literally, the last weekend, I could make changes in the book
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.960]   before it got shipped off to the center there.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.480]   And I was very relieved it was Larry
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.800]   because I realized looking through the book,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.320]   then it almost poor shot at it.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.280]   Because Larry's values are really the Google values.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.360]   They are Sergey.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.280]   It also subscribes to these values.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.680]   But it's really Larry with his obsession with speed
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.040]   and scale and ambition.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.640]   You take on big projects who really is the soul of Google.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.040]   And it wasn't really surprising that after 10 years of not
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.840]   being CEO, a job he never wanted to give up,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.160]   that he would come back at a time where Google really
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.040]   has to launch a fight.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.440]   How good a job.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.360]   What I said was the-- Schmidt was the Prince Regent.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   And we forgot, but always knew his job to train the true owners
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.840]   to take over.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.640]   Did he do a good job of training, Larry?
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.920]   Do you think that you sense growth in Larry over time?
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.040]   And how will he do as CEO?
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.520]   I think in some aspects, he'll do fine.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.840]   I really like some of the reorganization changes he's made.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.560]   But I think I would have hoped that he would have realized
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.960]   out straight out the gate.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.880]   Maybe he'll realize this eventually.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.800]   Now that he's the CEO, he can shut out the world.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.880]   He has to explain what he's doing.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.120]   And he has to really see that one important product
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.160]   that Google is, in addition to the important products
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.680]   like Android and Search and Ads, is the public perception
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.640]   of Google there.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.720]   And he can do a lot to shore that up by being transparent,
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.560]   by being more of a public person.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.240]   Not totally.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.200]   He doesn't have to be out as much as Eric was.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.800]   But maybe take some questions on an earnings score
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.400]   or something like that.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.520]   And so far, it seems like he's resisting that.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.200]   Do you think he could do it?
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.000]   I mean, some people just can't or took a long while,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.280]   for example, for Zuckerberg to learn how to do that.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.080]   I think just like Mark has learned to do it,
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.400]   he thought Larry can do it.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.240]   The times I've interviewed him, when he's finally--
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.080]   I finally nailed him down to the table
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.440]   and said, let's do the interview, he does just fine.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.640]   We're talking-- Steven Levy, he is the author
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.960]   of a brand new book that is being widely praised.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.120]   I've loved it so far.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.560]   It's really a great story in the plex.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.640]   How Google thinks works and shapes our lives.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.880]   And he literally was in the plex and got amazing access
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.000]   to everybody at Google.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.240]   Brand new from Simon and Schuster.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.080]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   There is some Google news.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.000]   But I think really we should take advantage of this chance
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.880]   to talk to Steven and get some more juicy gossip, frankly.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.320]   Yes.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.720]   That's all I care about.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.720]   Before we get to the juicy gossip,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.200]   let's talk about Squarespace.com, the secret
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.400]   behind exceptional websites.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.120]   I am a big Squarespace fan.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.440]   We put our Twit blog inside.twit.tv on Squarespace.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.560]   And I can't tell you what an easy, simple platform it is.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.240]   One of the needs that we had was for multiple users,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.080]   multiple editors and Squarespace handles
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.640]   that so elegantly.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.660]   Now it's hosting plus software, some of the best content
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.460]   management software out there.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.780]   Oops, that's the wrong picture.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.500]   Let me show you what a good job they did with our blog.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.060]   One of the nice things about it, of course,
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.840]   is that Squarespace is very flexible in terms of templates.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.140]   Every Squarespace site looks different.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.140]   See, we use the Twitter widget to incorporate our tweets
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.820]   in there.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.100]   They've got Flickr widgets, other social media widgets,
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.540]   Facebook, of course.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.940]   And it makes it very simple to design a site that
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.260]   looks unique, has all of the features and elements you want.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.580]   It doesn't have to be a blog.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.300]   It could be-- in fact, a lot of businesses
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.420]   use it for their business site.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.980]   If you don't have a website yet, your Facebook page doesn't
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.580]   count.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.020]   You need to have a website you own.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.700]   And that's where Squarespace is so great.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.660]   It starts at $12 a month, but you could try it free right now.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.380]   If you go to squarespace.com/twig, click that big green
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:43.660]   button.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.620]   You won't need a credit card.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.300]   You won't need anything.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   But the name of your site, a password, an email address,
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.260]   and under this capture.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.460]   And now you're setting up a site using all the features
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.900]   of Squarespace.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.140]   They're great iPad and iPhone application
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.580]   for posting content and moderating content.
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.700]   Here's some of the amazing sites.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.260]   They just all look different.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.940]   But I think if you're going to give--
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.300]   if there's a quality of Squarespace sites,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.620]   they always look fresh and clean and simple and easy to use.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.260]   There's just something about it.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.460]   They also are always very responsive.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.740]   And one of the reasons they're so responsive
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.380]   is because Squarespace does the hosting
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.540]   with some very sophisticated virtual hosting
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.660]   based on the Java network.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.620]   That means there's always bandwidth available for you.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.020]   I want you to check it out right now, free for the next two
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.300]   weeks.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.340]   Just go to squarespace.com/twig.
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.380]   And find out about all the great features that
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.100]   make Squarespace a unique platform for you.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.940]   Not just your blog, but your photo gallery, your e-commerce,
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.340]   whatever you're doing on the web.
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.700]   squarespace.com/twig.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.780]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.220]   This week in Google, Stephen Levy is here today.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.380]   So nice to have Stephen.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.180]   Not only respected journalists, both at Newsweek, now wired,
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.860]   but also the author of a brand new book called In The Flex.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.820]   Jeff Jarvis and Gina Tarpani also.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.020]   I've been hogging Stephen.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.340]   Go ahead, you guys can--
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.660]   I have a question.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.020]   Stephen, I know that John Battelle asked you
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.180]   about your opinions of things in the book.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.460]   And you said that you didn't try not to editorialize too much
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.860]   and that you just kind of laid the facts out.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.980]   That's what I love about the book.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.940]   Anyone who listens to this show should read this book.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.060]   It's just so dense and has so many great quotes.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.260]   But I had to ask, do you think that Google--
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.460]   at one point in the book, there's a Facebook panic.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.580]   There's a reckoning at Google that they
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.060]   have to kind of take on social.
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.900]   Do you think that Google has the capability to do that?
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.740]   I mean, they're so good at search and data,
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.180]   but they don't seem so good at people.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.140]   What's your take on that?
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.820]   Well, yeah.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.700]   And there's been a litany of failures in the social space.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.420]   But not one thread to say this was wrong with every single social
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.180]   thing they did.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.340]   Each one had a different problem.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.620]   Maybe one thread going through it
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.460]   is that Google doesn't really stick with products
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.540]   when they don't take off right away.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.260]   It's sort of a corporate ADD, which
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.900]   leads them to go into the next thing.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.380]   And they're so enamored of the idea
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.580]   that if they fail every so often,
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.860]   that shows they're trying hard, that maybe they don't work hard
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.180]   enough sometimes to turn failures into successes.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.860]   But in terms of whether they can do it,
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.460]   I think there's nothing generic in their DNA which
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.460]   says they can't do it.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.100]   They actually bring a lot of assets
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.020]   to bear to build a social product.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.780]   It's just that it's harder to do now.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.740]   And it is true that it's not Google's strength
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.340]   to catch up to someone.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.100]   I talked to one of your product managers
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.820]   for one of the earlier social products that said,
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.060]   we're not good at chasing tail lights.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.340]   We're good at going forward when there's
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.220]   no one out ahead of us.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.660]   We're ahead of everyone else.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.100]   But drunks chase tail lights.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.300]   So that's really not our natural strength.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.260]   Drunks and dogs.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.380]   I mean, what they need to do is not chase Facebook's tail light,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.300]   but to do something better, to innovate and social,
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.860]   do something better in social than Facebook does right now.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.780]   And I think it seems like they're struggling with that.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.220]   And it also does seem like they throw things against the wall
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.340]   and maybe not follow up as much like buzz and my beloved wave.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.900]   But that's kind of one of the problems
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.300]   with becoming so big, right?
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.380]   If you don't have an immediate success,
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.500]   it seems like a failure.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.700]   And then you can try something else.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.860]   Well, I talk about this new initiative.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.500]   And they allow me to say its name in here officially.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.980]   It's called Emerald Sig.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:36.820]   And this is a massive initiative in Google.
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.220]   And you're not going to see it all at once.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.220]   And you see now things which I think Google identifies
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.620]   as coming from their social initiative, like Social Search
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.580]   or recently the plus one button, right?
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.540]   And they're running this thing differently
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.020]   than they've won their previous product.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.220]   It's more of a top down, organized effort
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.300]   that's thought out more coherently there.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.860]   So let's see what happens there.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.780]   The idea isn't to kill Facebook.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.620]   The idea-- and this is me talking, not what they said to me--
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.260]   is that I think that Google really wants
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.420]   is to bring Facebook to the table.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.060]   It just makes Google crazy that people
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.260]   share all this information with Facebook
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.980]   about who they're in contact with
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.500]   and what their interests are and what they're doing.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.020]   And Google can't get at that.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.500]   That's very good information for Google,
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.900]   not just in the social sense, but in a search sense.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.860]   And I think with Google feels that they
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.260]   can get an equally important corpus of social information.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.460]   Maybe they can get Facebook to the table,
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.700]   where it's an advantage of both companies
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.500]   to sit and share with each other.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.260]   Now as a user, I think it's just ridiculous that Facebook
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.740]   doesn't share this information.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.420]   And Google might, in a peak, not give Facebook information
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.380]   in retaliation because this is our information.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.900]   So I don't like the idea of any of these big companies
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.540]   saying we can't easily export our information when we choose
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.500]   to any other site where that information could be useful.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.460]   I think that's very true.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.940]   But I've been arguing that the war between the two
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.060]   and others will be over signal generation.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:17.660]   The signals about us that Google clearly uses to target content
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.900]   and service and advertising to us in Facebook.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.660]   And Facebook right now is a far better signal generator.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.300]   So that is the goal.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.940]   That is the fleece.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.100]   I think it could be given up quite remarkably.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.500]   The other problem is that I think that--
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.260]   well ironically, put it this way, maybe.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.460]   Facebook could hide behind privacy.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.700]   Google wants us to share stuff, but we wouldn't do that.
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.220]   You would like to read portability as our right.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.460]   Here's Google's screen.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.380]   Google, or Facebook, you're right, is a great signal generator.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.860]   But Google is a much better signal interpreter.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.380]   Right.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.380]   All said.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.940]   So it knows how to take information and rank it much better
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.700]   than Facebook can.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.180]   It doesn't really strike me to Facebook
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.500]   we had any interest in that.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.900]   I mean, maybe they recognize that.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.820]   But it seems like the Facebook attitude is, well,
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.740]   we could do that.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.100]   Whatever Google could do, we could do better.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.500]   So what do we need them for?
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.260]   Stephen, Eric has said for a few years now,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.580]   whenever he's asked what Google's biggest challenge is,
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.420]   he says size.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.220]   The genius brought that up in terms of size.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.940]   I'd love to have your perspective, not just from the past,
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.020]   but for where you think it goes in the future about how hard
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.340]   it's going to be to manage the size of Google in terms
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.500]   of getting much bigger, faster, be figured out how to get past
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.860]   the mistakes that they do make now and right hand,
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.660]   left hand kind of mistakes.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.980]   See what it's like for people to work there.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.140]   Does it feel like a big oppressive company to some now?
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.420]   Well, you've identified.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.780]   I think Larry is actually much more worried about that
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.580]   than Eric was.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.340]   Even though Eric might have identified his number one
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.980]   problem, Larry is obsessed with making Google feel
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.780]   like a flatter company.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.980]   And that's, I think, what's behind that reorganization
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.820]   he just did that Google really hasn't formally put out
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.940]   a blog item about, but has acknowledged that the reports
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.100]   that first appeared in the LA Times are accurate,
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.340]   that he broke this down to these product groups.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.180]   And the--
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.540]   The gang of six.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.500]   Yeah, and that the czars of these various divisions
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:28.860]   are now working together in a clear line of demarcation
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.460]   to be able to clear away maybe some middle management
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.020]   and problems there.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.300]   And it is a huge problem for Google.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.340]   And especially since they're going to hire 6,000 more people
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.620]   this year, they've already hired the first 2,000.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.420]   So they've gone from 24,000 to 26,000.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.260]   Just this year, it'll be at 30,000 at the end of the year.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.980]   And what really makes this really hard for Google
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.140]   is that Google selects people who
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.340]   have an intolerance for bureaucracy.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.620]   The kind of people they love the higher most
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.700]   are people who are hard charging people who really hate it
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.860]   when they're frustrated by management
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.420]   to block them to do what they want to do.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.340]   They're the kind of people that say, I'm out of here when
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.380]   they run into these Dilbert situations.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.420]   So some of these are inevitable in a big company like that.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   And that's one reason for Google's brain drain.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.740]   Google has this thing called an OKR you talk about in here.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.100]   Is that their attempt to handle bureaucracy?
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.140]   Well, it's one of them.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.980]   I found that Google has a number of these systems
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.460]   internally, which are huge for people at Google,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.420]   but never really discussed with the outside.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.340]   OKR's is something that stands for objective key results.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.940]   And it's something invented by Andy Grove and John Doer
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.820]   brought it into Google.
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.620]   But Google embraced it like no other company has.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.780]   So every Googler for every quarter and every year,
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.300]   they set these goals for themselves.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.100]   They're all measurable.
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.900]   Everything has to be measurable at Google.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.460]   And various times during the quarter,
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.180]   they stop and they sit down with people
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.980]   and they say, how am I doing my OKRs?
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.900]   For instance, when you're working on the Chrome browser,
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.140]   you're launching it, your OKR might have been,
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.940]   we need a million users of Chrome by November.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.620]   And you see how you're doing on that.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.500]   One interesting thing about it is if you meet all your OKRs,
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.060]   all your goals, then you're not really not being Googler.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.100]   You have to say your goal is high enough.
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.180]   So upper level, meaning it is about 2/3 of your OKR there.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.900]   You're going to really titrate your OKRs.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.580]   What you mean is the epitome of a bureaucracy.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.340]   It's fine.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.620]   That's a good making your OKRs.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.140]   And what interesting is that everyone
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.620]   could get to look at everyone else's OKRs.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.500]   On the internal website, it has an amazing transparency,
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.420]   transparency within the company that we don't have
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.460]   from without the company.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.500]   Google's like a lobster.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.220]   It's hardly on the outside and soft on the inside.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.940]   And so you could look at Larry and Sergey's OKRs
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.660]   and see what their goals are.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.460]   Sounds a little bit like TPS reports.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.620]   It's exactly the kind of thing that would chase me right out
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.860]   of there.
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.420]   When I visited the campus and was in the Gmail area,
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.540]   I was struck by they had these giant monitors all around.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.420]   And if there was any bug that was blocking
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.180]   the next release of Gmail, the developers photo
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.940]   and the issue number and whatever the description was,
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.380]   showed all the monitor.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.660]   And I remember thinking like my god, as a developer,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.540]   it's quite a motivation.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.780]   There was this like transparency and yeah, I'm blocking the build.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.340]   I got to fix that bug.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.340]   Wow.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.340]   Yeah, there was Steven.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.380]   I still want to hear.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.340]   Let me put it this way.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.300]   Do you think it's still a fun place to work?
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.540]   Would you want to work there?
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.540]   Well, for what I do, I'm not an engineer,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.100]   so I wouldn't have as much fun.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.700]   But in a lot of ways, it's fun.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:51.780]   The people who really still get a huge satisfaction from it
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:56.420]   are those computer scientists that are still pushing
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.580]   what can be done.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.220]   Google still wants to do more and more and more
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.460]   with big data and machine learning
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.780]   and other computer science issues there.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.580]   So that's why a lot of the key people they hired,
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.540]   great computer scientists, five, six, seven, eight years ago,
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.780]   are still with the company.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.860]   And I think it's interesting that of those,
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.420]   a gang of six you talked about, a couple of those people
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.820]   have been there since almost the very beginning of Google.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.940]   And they had to essentially re-enlist.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.020]   They had to recommit to a few more years.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.660]   So that's something about their belief in Larry,
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.940]   that these people who are richer than God by now,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.540]   and they can do whatever they wanted,
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.740]   they have decided, yeah, I'm going to spend
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:37.260]   the next few years of my life working with Larry Page.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.700]   There's been some brain drain.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.540]   There's a great quote I'm trying to find in here
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.460]   about Facebook from somebody who left Google for Facebook.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.700]   And it's saying that Facebook is the thing,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   is the real thing.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.700]   Facebook is that company.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.140]   It was almost like a taunt to his former colleagues.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.460]   He sent an email out and saying, well,
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.020]   you guys are working for the horse and buggy company now.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.420]   Yeah, because I'm going to that company.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.820]   Interestingly, that guy has already left Facebook.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.140]   - That wasn't that company.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.780]   - But Google has had to deal with that kind of a brain drain.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.700]   But it isn't, you're right.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.700]   It's absolutely telling the Vic Gundrotra and Andy Rubin,
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.420]   what about Marissa Meyer?
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.980]   What do you think is your sense of what happened to her?
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.940]   She was not in that gang of six.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.180]   Nor was local at one of the six categories.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.100]   - Yeah, well, in theory, I think an information,
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.540]   an explanation I heard sort of secondhand
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.860]   was the old Jeff Huber who's in charge of local.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.580]   He's more of an engineering guy,
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.380]   and this is more of a product person.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.820]   I haven't sat down and talked with her about that.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.300]   But I actually feel that Google,
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.980]   this is one reason that I think you really have to put out
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.820]   some explanation about a press release, a blog item.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.180]   You talk to a friendly journalist, right?
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:51.820]   And because that way you could protect the employees
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.180]   that look like they got a bad deal out of the reorganization.
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.180]   And you could make an explanation about that.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.020]   Right now, it's sort of hanging people out the dry
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.580]   who people expected would have been in that group.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.580]   - Yeah.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.980]   You still got a lot of brilliant people in Google
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.340]   who are not in that group,
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.300]   but people like Peter Novorvik and others who are.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.660]   - Yeah, no, no, it's not, you know,
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.460]   all the smartest people there.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.220]   For instance, in search, you know,
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.980]   there's one guy who's sort of like the Yoda of Google,
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.020]   I'm at single, you know, who's just an amazing person.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.300]   He was my transcribers, favorite subject.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.580]   I could maybe like, at least four inter,
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.060]   one of the interviews with him as he tried to get it
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.900]   through my thick head how Google's search quality works.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.820]   And, you know, and he's an amazing guy
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.700]   and a terrific computer scientist.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.220]   - We quoted from the excerpt they published in Wired
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.340]   about Eric Schmidt asking if they could remove
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.300]   some information about him from the Google index
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.940]   and being told by Cheryl Sandberg that no.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.180]   (laughs)
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.820]   - Well, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't show.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.060]   And so this was information that was given to me
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.820]   by the employee, so it was actually tough.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.860]   Yeah, and it was relatively early in Eric's time.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.140]   The idea wasn't that he had made up some political donation.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.700]   He didn't want anyone to know.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.900]   But I think that the context of the way she explained it to me
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.580]   was that she, her job was to handle calls
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.140]   from people who couldn't understand why information
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.300]   that they considered personal was coming up
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.220]   when people googled them, where they googled themselves there.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.260]   And, you know, and so she had to deal with this every day
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.940]   of people who had, you know, their address would be exposed
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.540]   to an ex-boyfriend or things like that.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.860]   And she had to explain to them, as Larry and Sergey explained
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.100]   to her that anything is public, we have in there.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.580]   And then we have to do this.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.940]   And then this poll comes from Eric's office saying,
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.660]   you know, Eric wants you to get this stuff out.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.940]   And, you know, she, I think, enlisted according
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.060]   to her story, she enlisted Cheryl to back her up
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.580]   when she went to Eric's office and said,
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.420]   we don't do that.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.140]   And Eric dropped the request there.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.660]   Now, Eric, I should say, he wasn't very happy
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.580]   when this came out, even though I did try to check it
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.780]   with him, you know, but doing the fact checking process,
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.220]   I checked about a million facts.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.740]   And for some reason, I guess this didn't get to him.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.540]   But he says, you know, I think he wants me to say this,
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.500]   as far as he's concerned, this incident didn't happen.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.420]   But, you know, I have the person on the record
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.660]   saying it did, so you can make your own decision.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.260]   - Denise Griffin, who has since been replaced
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.860]   by a Python script, probably.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.860]   (all laughing)
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.860]   - I think she was one of those people
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.700]   who retired very comfortably.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.540]   (all laughing)
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.140]   - Before my book came out.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.260]   - I wonder how many millionaires Google has made, actually.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.580]   - Well, even though, masseuse was a millionaire, right?
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.420]   - Really?
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.740]   - Right, one of the original, yeah.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.380]   Cooks and the masseuse in the beginning,
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.500]   I forget her name.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.980]   - Yeah.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.500]   And more so now.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.340]   (all laughing)
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.180]   - Right, the stock keeps going up.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.780]   At one point, Larry and Sergey were absolutely
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.380]   be sautted by Steve Jobs,
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.180]   and even considered making him the CEO.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.020]   I don't know if Steve considered it.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.100]   - No, no, it was when John Doer and Mike Mardt's
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.220]   adventure capitalists who funded Google,
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.100]   only on the condition that they were going to get a CEO,
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.900]   and then a few months afterwards,
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.980]   they tried to renege on the deal.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.860]   They called up John Doer.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.660]   Doer told me this himself and said,
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.860]   we decided we want to run the place ourselves.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.380]   So Doer said, listen, just do this.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.980]   Why don't I put you together with a lot of great CEOs?
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.500]   You'll see what an experienced CEO really does,
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.460]   and how they can help build this company.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.660]   So they went on a tour of CEOs around Silicon Valley,
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.620]   and up in Seattle, they took Jeff Bezos,
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.420]   and they came back and said, you're right,
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.500]   we want an outsider ever see you, we want Steve Jobs.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.940]   (laughing)
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.780]   And that was about-- - And that was about--
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.620]   - Jesus, please. - Yeah.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.060]   And so then they convinced him to look at Eric,
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.100]   and they liked that, and I think I worked out
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   to everyone's-- - I think Eric was exactly
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.300]   the right adult supervision.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.260]   - What do you think Eric's gonna do next?
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.660]   And when?
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.460]   - I don't know, I mean,
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   my personal guess is he'll stay there,
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.060]   but if something great comes along,
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.980]   he might go off to that.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.620]   - We're talking to Steven Levy, the new book,
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.860]   In The Plex, a must read that is unaudible as well,
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.100]   so we could say it's a must listen.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.700]   And it's been, I have one copy,
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.260]   and everybody's trying to grab it from me,
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.100]   Tom Merritt wants to read this.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.740]   - There's still no more on sale, do you?
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.580]   - Hell, really?
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.900]   (laughing)
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:28.740]   - It's all about the Kindle.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.140]   - I'm kind of a cheapskate,
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.460]   this is the one the publisher sent,
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.180]   so I got this one for free.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.580]   - Yeah, I'm learning to love DRM,
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.940]   you can't loan down your loan line.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.620]   (laughing)
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.700]   - Steven Levy, learning to love DRM.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.940]   We will have more in just a bit,
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.460]   but first a little word from hover.com,
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.500]   hover is domain name registration made simple.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.180]   All you have to do is search the tweet stream
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.700]   for people who are saying,
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.900]   "Leo, thank you for telling me about hover,
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.540]   there are some very happy people here."
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.300]   And you know what, I got a tweet from somebody who said,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.900]   oh no, I'm having all sorts of trouble,
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.020]   they're not very good, and I watched,
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.580]   'cause the hover Twitter person,
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.500]   the social media person responded immediately,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.180]   got it solved, and that person ended up being just very,
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.820]   very impressed, a very happy hover,
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.500]   is the place to go if you wanna register a domain name,
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.460]   if you have domains, I would suggest moving them
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.580]   as I have to hover.com.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.140]   In fact, they will do that for you for free,
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.620]   normally they charge $25 for the domain concierge service,
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.660]   where they do all the work for you,
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.860]   you can do it for yourself if you want,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.900]   but for $25 they'll move all your domains,
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.740]   except when you tell them you heard it on Twig,
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.540]   they'll waive that fee even.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.260]   Now they do charge $10 per domain that you move there,
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.660]   but that gives you another year,
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.180]   so it's extending it for another year for $10,
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.340]   and the no upsell automatically built in free,
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.940]   who is privacy, and a no hold policy
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.900]   for customer service calls during business hours,
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.580]   you get a customer service rep,
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.060]   they will solve the problem,
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.380]   and they will not put you on hold.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.220]   To get cover, the free customer service number,
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.660]   go to Twig, the free concierge customer,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.860]   the free concierge transfer service, there we go.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.860]   Go to TWIG.Hover.com,
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.620]   and you'll see in the upper right hand corner,
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.900]   there is a phone number you can call,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.300]   and just say, I heard it on Twig,
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.500]   and they will absolutely do that all for you,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.020]   and I've talked to a couple of people who've done this,
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.940]   and really, I wish I had done it, it's really great.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.540]   Also save money on your registration
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.260]   when you use Twig as the offer code,
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.020]   so all in all, this is a good deal
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.940]   with a great registrar that makes it simple.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.340]   You see how clean it is?
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.980]   This is what I like, not a lot of upsell.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.460]   Sorry, no sexy girls on the front page,
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.700]   just domain registration.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.100]   Isn't that what you're looking for?
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.460]   Hover! - So nice.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.140]   - Isn't that nice? - Nice.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.140]   - Twig, they don't spend a whole lot of money
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.020]   on television ads, there's no Super Bowl ad,
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.980]   they just, good service, and us.
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.820]   TWIG.hover.com, it's our secret weapon
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.420]   for domain name registration, and we're just big, big fans.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:08.620]   So, a couple of stories, and actually Steven,
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.740]   I'd love to get your reaction to these news stories.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.300]   For instance, it just broke this morning,
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.740]   Yahoo! sold delicious to YouTubers,
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.260]   Chad, Hurley, and Steve Chen.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.700]   They left YouTube not so long ago.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.300]   - But isn't Chad still at Google?
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.140]   - Oh, Chad's still there, Steven left.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:29.140]   - Yeah, yeah, Chad's more an advisory role now.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.380]   He's not the CEO of YouTube,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.180]   there's this amazing guy, Sal R. Comanger,
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.420]   who's one person describing to me
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.700]   as the secret president of Google.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.140]   He plays a super influential person,
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.820]   and a bright person, but he makes Larry look extroverted.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.140]   He's very shocked in the public.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.060]   - I've emailed him saying,
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.340]   "Why aren't we on YouTube live?"
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.380]   And he's been very shy with me, actually.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.380]   (laughing)
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.580]   - Very sweet guy, very smart guy.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.340]   - Well, good, I'll tell him Steven sent me.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.820]   (laughing)
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.140]   So, I thought that was interesting, though.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.660]   I hope that they, I'm not sure why they bought delicious.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.220]   I know it was a good deal, Yahoo!
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.460]   - I just thanked them for doing so.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.380]   - Thank you.
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.300]   - Yeah, can somebody take a picture too?
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.140]   Could they buy anything else that Yahoo's ruined?
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.500]   - It was pocket change for them.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.740]   I think Yahoo was asking $2 million for delicious.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:25.620]   The company that Chad and Steven run is called AVOS
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.060]   at AVOS.com.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.460]   - And what is it?
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.540]   - It's probably a holding company.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.580]   I don't know, let's see.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.900]   About us, let's see what it says.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.340]   - Doesn't say much.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.220]   It just says that we, that they acquire delicious.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.660]   - Yeah, Avos is a new internet company.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.020]   And we, can we buy delicious?
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.980]   And yeah, that's about it.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.420]   They spent, well, let's see,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.420]   they spent one, one thousands of the money
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.940]   that they got from Google for YouTube.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:59.660]   They could buy 999 other Yahoo products and properties.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:05.740]   Other stories, Visa says we are gonna,
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.460]   I guess back with money, Jack Dorsey's Square,
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.100]   which we've talked about before is a really great product.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.700]   - Which, I mean, the money is undetermined,
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.340]   but the more important thing in the way
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.060]   is that they're gonna back as a service.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.580]   And that's wildly important.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.500]   - Of course, Square does take Visa cards.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.540]   So it wasn't, it doesn't like add Visa cards
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.860]   to the Square capabilities.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.460]   - It adds this credibility to it.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.660]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.540]   - You know, we know the Verusign,
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.340]   you know, as you guys reminded me earlier,
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.180]   - Slamming.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.060]   - You're really, what attacked them
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.700]   and sort of tried to create fear,
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.820]   and uncertainty and doubt that this was like a safe way
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.740]   to do things.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:47.740]   So, Visa gets on board, then we know that
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.060]   this has the backing of it.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.580]   It's something that everyone can use
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.500]   and feel comfortable about.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.340]   - I love that.
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.580]   You get this, this is the Square device.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.820]   And this end is for free, if you go to squareup.com
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.500]   and it goes into your Android phone or your iPhone
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.980]   into the, believe it or not, into the audio, Jack.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.740]   So it's just really a little credit card reader.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.100]   It turns into audio, then the Square,
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.420]   the free Square software sees the number and says,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.180]   okay, and how much do you wanna charge?
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.220]   - Into the, believe it or not, into the audio, Jack.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.740]   - Where am I getting my audio from?
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.220]   - The credit card, it turns into audio,
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.180]   then the Square, the free Square software.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.580]   - That's from you, Stephen.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.340]   Did you suddenly turn on to it?
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.540]   - It's usually me.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.540]   - Yeah, where is this?
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.500]   - Where is that coming from?
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   You plug in your headphones.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.060]   So it's not Verifone, it's Vericine, it's Verifone,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:38.900]   Not Vericine.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.620]   So I screwed you up, Stephen, by saying it was Vericine,
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.220]   it's Verifone, thank you to our chatroom.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.100]   They're the company that was a little perturbed
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.860]   by Square, I presume they're offering a competitive device.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.780]   There we go.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.500]   Can you still hear me?
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.780]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:58.220]   - Well, I'm hearing that an echo here
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.860]   from a couple of minutes ago, this is a little strange.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.980]   - Yeah, that's coming in through your computer,
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.180]   make sure you don't have us running.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.780]   Like close your web browser, I like this.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.620]   - Like that, yeah.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.740]   - Yeah, Verifone offers secure payment solutions
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.740]   for credit cards, so they don't like this.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.580]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.460]   - Anyway, this is a great little product,
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.980]   and I mean, I don't have any reason to charge anybody anything,
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.740]   but if I did, I would buy that.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.740]   - It kind of makes you want a cup of the reason I saw stuff.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.580]   - It does!
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.420]   - Yeah.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.100]   - I'm gonna bring it to food camp,
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.220]   we're just gonna take donations.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.100]   - Yeah, wanna give me money?
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.900]   - Give me money.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.860]   - Well, we're gonna sell bricks, you know, in the new studio,
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.940]   we're gonna have, you could put your name on a brick
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.820]   for a hundred bucks, maybe I could just use this.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.060]   - There you go, Leo.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.420]   - I'll take it to food camp.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.140]   - Get your name out of brick, get your name out of brick here.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.700]   - A hundred bucks, get your name out of brick.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.580]   Let's see, Square does sell it's hearing in the stores,
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.180]   you can buy a Square device for 10 bucks,
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.540]   but then you get $10 credit, so it's a good deal.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.220]   - Which stores can you buy them?
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.820]   - Ah, let me see, it's a chatroom saying that.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.140]   - Is the Apple store doing it now?
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.060]   - Apple store, that's right, they're selling it.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.220]   - That's right, that's what it was, yeah.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.420]   - Which is cool too.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.700]   - Visa, back Square, let's see, oh, Google and Apple,
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.420]   were summoned to a Senate hearing on mobile device privacy.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.020]   Of course, that's the big story that Apple got in trouble for.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.700]   Now Steve Jobs is saying, no, we're not tracking you.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.860]   (laughs)
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.540]   - We weren't bringing it to Apple.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.980]   - Yeah, we didn't, we didn't really, that was just,
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.420]   that was a mistake, it was a bug.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.300]   - You know, I think the story was overblown however,
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.940]   it's just not hard to be transparent,
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.300]   it's not hard to give people a choice.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.180]   - It's not an Apple's DNA.
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.180]   - Yeah, boy, it's just, we're doing this,
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.220]   we're doing this for good reason.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.980]   You can cut it off, it's your phone, for God's sakes.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:55.500]   Is this the same problem, Leo, when it comes to do not track,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.460]   is that we've, you know, the Wall Street Journal
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.100]   and folks like that have made, have so demonized
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:04.620]   the little cookie that it could have a huge impact
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.820]   on the media business, on this very business.
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.180]   - We were talking on the security now about that,
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.660]   and I hadn't really thought about it,
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.540]   but if they enforce a do not track cookie,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.740]   I don't know if the kinds of tracking that we do,
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.340]   you know, when you download the podcast,
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.460]   whether you use iTunes, Zoom, or click directly on our website,
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.940]   if you notice the URL on all of the,
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.860]   and everywhere that you get it,
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.580]   it is a redirect through our ad agency, PodTrack,
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.340]   and that redirect basically is a tracking cookie.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.500]   It's not even a cookie, it just,
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.860]   you sends your IP address to PodTrack,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.020]   who adds it to a database to make sure it's a unique address,
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.900]   'cause advertisers don't wanna pay for your 17 downloads,
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.700]   so they only count it once, that's why they have to track it,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.860]   but I think that's tracking,
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.980]   and if the do not track setting in your browser
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.540]   prohibits that,
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.660]   - So I've put a set of business.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.900]   - The advertising and media industries
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.660]   for not being fully transparent about this,
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.900]   and I'm just saying this is what we do,
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.300]   this is why we do it, it's a good reason,
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.700]   it's how you get stuff free from the beginning.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.940]   So then that allowed the likes of the Wall Street Journal
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.940]   to demonize that, and then in our new privacy,
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.340]   industrial regulatory complex along comes the FTC,
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.180]   and others trying to say,
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.780]   "Oh my God, we can make hay from regulating this,"
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.780]   and Congress, and it turns into a spiral
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.460]   of unintended consequences,
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.500]   and so Apple is hurting the industry
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.060]   by not having been more transparent about this.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.780]   Google is somewhat more transparent,
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.380]   'cause it does make you opt in,
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.940]   but in general it's harmless,
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.500]   and the industry should have let us know it was there.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.780]   - Well, go ahead, Stephen.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.780]   - Yeah, you really have,
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.860]   I agree with the transparency,
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.500]   you really have to let people know exactly
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.060]   what the trade-offs are.
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.660]   Now the trade-offs is obviously different,
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.140]   and you just wanna listen to this podcast
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.580]   and you're tracking their well.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.860]   Okay, I understand that's worth it,
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.820]   but the question is,
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.740]   are people comfortable with the idea
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.380]   that they will be tracked wherever they go on the web
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.140]   in order to get ads they hadn't seen before,
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.900]   ads that might be a little more relevant to them,
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.820]   and display ads when they go to a website.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.820]   Some people might think, yes,
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.260]   some people might think, no.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.580]   Likewise, some people might think it's worth it
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:22.500]   to let their phone send back information
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.820]   about local Wi-Fi spot hotspots,
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:30.820]   because that could help them locate themselves more accurately.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.340]   And buried in that thing, Apple also said,
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.500]   yeah, we're also getting information about traffic from there.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.060]   That's another way we're getting location information
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.180]   about people, and that's a nice trade-off to say,
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.420]   yeah, I'll let the thing track me in traffic
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.940]   if I could know the best route to take somewhere else.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.180]   So obviously, ultimately the best thing to do
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.260]   would be say, hey, if you want good traffic information,
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.940]   you have to share back,
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.860]   you have to share back your traffic information,
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.780]   and then we promise we won't keep it
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.980]   for a long period of time.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.340]   One thing that came out in that Apple explanation was,
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.500]   I said, oh, it was a bug that we kept this
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.980]   for months and months and months.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.060]   We really don't have no really good reason
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.340]   to keep it for that long.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:16.380]   - The Google response to this, as quoted by TechCrunch,
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.700]   is all location sharing on Android is opt-in by the user,
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.860]   and we've all seen when you activate the Android phone,
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.060]   those two check boxes that say,
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.220]   and by the way, Apple says, oh, we do that too.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.460]   They don't say it's location sharing.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.380]   They say, would you be willing to send anonymous user data back
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.060]   to Apple to improve our services,
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.660]   but they say that's the check box for the iPhone.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.340]   - Oh, BS to that.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.820]   - Well, it is.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.340]   And if you look at the terms of service,
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.060]   it is in that 35 page terms of service,
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.660]   we collect out location information,
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.220]   we share it with our advertisers, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.060]   Although-- - Everyone has read, of course.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.300]   - Nobody's read, obviously.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.180]   Google says we provide users with notice and control
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:57.220]   over the collection, sharing, and use of location
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.860]   in order to provide a better mobile experience
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:43:59.740]   on Android devices.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.780]   Any location data that's sent back to Google location servers
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.940]   is anonymized and not tied or traceable to a specific user,
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.860]   but the journal who quoted a security expert,
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.780]   Sammy Kamkar, says that the data provided by Mr. Kamkar
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.100]   to the journal contained a unique identifier tied
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.180]   to an individual's phone.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:25.020]   It is not anonymous, probably something like the IMEI number,
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.180]   but if Google's not keeping track of it,
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.020]   what Google says is that it doesn't save
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.220]   that unique identification number, but it's not--
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.460]   - As you pointed out, Leo, it's worse.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.620]   The phone company has all this and more.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.980]   - Yeah.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.100]   - And it's as you point, what's the thing it's called?
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.780]   Were you subpoena without a subpoena?
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.260]   - The pen register.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.500]   - Pen register, right?
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.540]   - So the phone company not only has it,
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.860]   but offers it to law enforcement routinely
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.620]   for a small price, it's a little profit center
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.100]   for the phone companies.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.660]   But you know, I am sympathetic for normal people
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.540]   who say, "What, what?"
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.540]   I didn't understand that, they're tracking me
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.580]   and I don't think it is explicit what you get.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.100]   What my fear is that even if we make it explicit,
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.260]   look, you get better traffic data or look,
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.660]   you get a podcast or look, this advertising
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.220]   supports the free websites you read like Wired
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.780]   and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.220]   Even if you explain that, people can say,
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.140]   "Well, okay, but I don't want to, I don't want you to know."
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.820]   - Well then, then that's, you know what?
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.620]   That's the paywall all support.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.140]   Take the cookie or pay.
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.500]   And you know what, pay and don't get advertising
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.020]   and become a valuable reader in a different way.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.460]   I'd buy that paywall, you know, it's gonna be really hard.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.660]   - I could testify myself very uncomfortable
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.540]   to be on this side of the equation.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.060]   I almost feel like the music industry.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.980]   You're putting us out of business.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.140]   - Oh, you're right Leo, you're right.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.580]   Because there's no harm.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.140]   - But you know what a paywall inevitably creates?
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:50.980]   - I agree to you.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.820]   - I don't want to pay. - I don't want to pay.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.620]   - I don't want that.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:57.820]   If I have a paywall and I give you something for that money,
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.420]   I've got to somehow protect it.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.060]   So the next step is to keep you sons of guns
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.740]   from stealing my stuff.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.660]   - That is the ultimate unintended consequence of do not track.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.420]   What will happen is if it really happens
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.340]   and it really happens big, then certain media sites
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.540]   will have to go behind the paywall
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.060]   to get monetization they've now lost.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.140]   And a lot of media will die.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.540]   - So just when we go to France to talk to Mr. Sarkozy,
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.540]   we're going to tell him that, right?
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.060]   - Right.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.500]   - I should tell everybody that Loiklimer,
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.420]   who was the guy responsible that I found out
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.060]   for getting me invited to the EGA forum,
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.460]   heard us talk about it last week on Twig,
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.660]   and said, "I should invite Jeff.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.260]   Why did I invite you?"
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.500]   So--
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.340]   - Nice, we're going to have double representation.
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.180]   - Jeff's going to go too.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.020]   Right, Jeff's going to--
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.540]   - Now you had to get out of something.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.380]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.820]   I feel awful, mesh in Toronto, which Matthew Ingram runs,
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.660]   which is a great conference.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.580]   I've always wanted to go to,
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.420]   but I figure if a chance to see Miss Yulepres et al.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.540]   And I was very concerned that I didn't want to step
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.900]   on Leo's toes, because Leo is the president of the internet.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:01.740]   - That was just--
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.260]   - I go as his valet.
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.460]   - That was just ridiculous.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.540]   - His valet.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.820]   - And by the way, my friend is lending us an apartment.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.220]   So you don't have to worry about,
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:12.100]   'cause insane French hotel costs in May.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.100]   - The airfarers are ridiculous too.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.100]   - Looks sort of pretty good.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:17.940]   How do I get all this?
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.780]   - You want to go?
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.900]   - Yeah, no, seriously.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.340]   - So the deal is that the G8 summit is coming up
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:27.140]   in Doville, end of May, and Sarkozy,
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.660]   and I think with the kind of,
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:35.500]   I imagine Loique put a little pressure on him,
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.300]   asked, has asked a bunch of internet entrepreneurs
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.740]   and thought leaders, I guess,
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:43.580]   to go to France the week before for a forum
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.380]   in which they will have working sessions
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:49.100]   and create a document to hand to the G8 leaders
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.660]   about the internet and the economy.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.020]   And while there'll be big stakeholders like Jeff Bezos,
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.700]   and I'm sure X-Men will be there in Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.580]   I think it's a good opportunity for those of us
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.460]   who represent the people to go there and to say, hey,
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:07.660]   - I have a fantasy of getting up for the microphone
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.060]   and having the chorus from Les Mies behind.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.320]   (laughing)
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.860]   (humming)
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.420]   - Sure, Nicholas would appreciate that.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.660]   - As soon as you say, create a document by committee,
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:20.660]   I'm staying home.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.500]   - Yeah, you don't wanna do that.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.500]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:23.340]   - Did you get this?
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.180]   - Yeah, we don't wanna go to that track.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.380]   - Did you get the schedule of plenary session,
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.620]   working group, working group,
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.780]   and he says, you know, and we're gonna get some crap
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.980]   and deserve it for, you know,
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.900]   what makes you think this organization,
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.580]   and that's part of what I'm gonna say too,
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.860]   is Mr. Sarkozy hands off, please.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.220]   This is not government's,
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.420]   - Right. - kerf,
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.100]   and but that's what, you know,
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.740]   why do these people appoint themselves?
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.000]   And I think that'll be legitimate criticism we'll get.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.660]   On the other hand, I also think this is a discussion
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.720]   that has to be happening.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.040]   What are the principles?
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.140]   - Well, I was delighted that the Justice Minister
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.920]   in Germany reacted to my silly little principles
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.220]   and talked about them,
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.680]   and it's a discussion that we need.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.880]   - Yes, well, I'm so glad you're gonna be there.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.780]   I'll just sit back and watch.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.620]   - Oh, no.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.520]   - But I'm thrilled anyway, that's exciting.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.600]   And Steven--
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.000]   - Oyster's for all.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.480]   - Steven, I'm sure Loeck is listening
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   if you can put in a good word for you.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.840]   - That's okay, oh.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.280]   I still have my book out here.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   - Yeah, are you touring all around with this book?
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.120]   Are you, I mean, are,
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.160]   is there interest from mainstream media?
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.800]   - Yeah, literally I just got back an hour ago
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.320]   from, you know, a two week book tour,
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.040]   including talks at Google and Facebook
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.800]   and Microsoft was kind of interesting to get those questions
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.160]   in different places there.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.440]   And there's a lot of interest.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.400]   And I'm on the bestseller list,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.280]   so we can-- - Awesome, yay.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.040]   - Congratulations, it's well deserved.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.840]   - I find it interesting that Google invited you
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.680]   to come to Google to speak about your book about Google.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.240]   - Yes, I actually did it in New York
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.880]   and in Mountain View there.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.000]   They have some pretty good questions.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.480]   I actually thought that Facebook question
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.320]   is really interesting.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.240]   The first question I got at Facebook was,
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.160]   why don't more people leave Google
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   and come here to Facebook?
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.560]   (laughs)
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.480]   And your answer?
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.960]   I said, when I started, I guess how many people here
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.360]   are from Google and like over a dozen hands went up.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.680]   I said, isn't that enough?
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.520]   - Yeah.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.360]   - You wanna go to Google?
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.200]   - I get greedy guys.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.680]   - I'm like a midnight raid on the place.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.920]   (laughs)
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.800]   - Why can't we hire more people away?
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.040]   Well, you made that point already in this conversation
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.360]   that there's still some value,
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.840]   engineers still find some interesting things happening
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.680]   at Google.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.440]   Man, this stuff goes fast.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.320]   You know, it's 11 year old, 12 year old company
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.840]   and already people are saying, oh yeah,
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.280]   it's over the hill.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   - Yeah, well, and then you see people leaving Facebook.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.920]   You know, the guys who started Quora, right?
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.760]   - Right.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.000]   - You know, the other people there,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.840]   you know, that there are startups.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.480]   That's really where people wanna go.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.560]   - It's true, as soon as something becomes a big company,
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.000]   inevitably it becomes a little bit bureaucratized
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.360]   and there's less opportunity and less excitement
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.120]   and it's really fun to be the people
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.680]   who are changing the world.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.360]   - Yeah, so Google's trying to give people,
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.240]   you know, this startup experience
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.280]   within the company there.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.840]   So they took John Hankey, who is the guy who did Keyhole,
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.440]   which became Google Earth
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.760]   and he was the head of the GEO products there.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.960]   And they moved about a day to day operations
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:16.240]   and now he's in sort of a think tank for GEO,
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.360]   coming up with new long-term ideas.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.600]   So that's one way that they're trying to make the job
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.360]   continually interesting to their good people.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.160]   - I notice also that there is this feeling
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.240]   that each group has a certain amount of autonomy
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.720]   and we've noticed that they've all launched products
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.920]   on the same day, for instance,
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.800]   there doesn't seem to be that much coordination between them.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.040]   - Yeah, it's usual on April Fool's Day, too.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.880]   (laughs)
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:38.800]   - Yeah, very good.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.120]   They must have a lot of people working
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.320]   on April Fool's Day all year long.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.680]   - Yeah, it's their big holiday, really.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   It's like Christmas for them.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.520]   Really?
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.080]   The month before, they're all busy doing it.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.640]   There are people who's one guy I think whose job,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.160]   you know, like a huge part of his job, if not full time,
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.480]   is, you know, for certainly maybe half the year
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.480]   is coordinating and working on April Fool's things.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.560]   - That's a stopover without scary.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.360]   (laughs)
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.200]   - Really?
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   - Well, you know, you start the book with a description
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.560]   of Halloween at Google and--
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.840]   - It was my first visit to Google.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.800]   It was October, 1999.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.480]   And, you know, I heard so much about it
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.000]   and I was using the search engine.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.840]   I thought it was great.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   I mean, I gotta go meet these people
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.000]   and I go there and Larry Page is dressed like a Viking.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.920]   He's got a big furry vest and with corns coming out of it
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.760]   and Sergei's dressed like a cow.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.840]   He's wearing a cow suit with a plastic breastplate
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.680]   with big disgusting udders coming out of it.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.520]   (laughs)
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.720]   - So a Viking account, it can be into a room
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.400]   and explain page like to me.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.000]   - I just think it's really sad when a serious company
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.400]   gets, you know, doesn't take itself--
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.560]   (laughs)
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.400]   - Don't take it somewhere.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.480]   - That was a plan.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.720]   Come on.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.880]   If I'd only had the fur jacket, it was that of the udders.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.800]   Stephen, we're gonna let you go, but thank you so much.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.000]   It really is a great book.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.440]   I've enjoyed reading it and of course,
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.040]   it's always a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.880]   - And I got to fulfill my dream being on this week in Google.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.600]   - Well, you say that to all.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.280]   I sure you said it good morning in the app,
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.440]   you said the same thing.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.000]   (laughs)
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.080]   It's been my dream to work with you, Tom and Sally.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.640]   - Oh no, no, this is it, this is the peak.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.520]   - Well Stephen, come on anytime, you know you're always--
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.720]   - Okay, all right, Stephen, we have one more question.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.720]   - One more question.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.560]   - Okay.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.920]   - How often are we, especially I, wrong about Google?
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:33.840]   - Well, I'm not gonna judge you in a particular job,
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.320]   but a lot of times people are wrong about Google.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.920]   They underestimate it because it looks so chaotic
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.960]   and they do build in a lot of chaos
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.400]   and some of the chaos really isn't intentional,
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.600]   but I think there is a core of what they do.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.480]   Even something as far afield seemingly
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.200]   as the autonomous cars,
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.880]   I could see the googly-ness in it, like, you know,
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.920]   that it really is in the spirit of their other kinds of products
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.160]   in terms of it's a machine learning device
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.400]   that draws information, the environment around it
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.920]   and draws on information from Google's servers
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.040]   and databases or data centers and things like that.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.720]   So I think that that's something people miss,
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.200]   that there is a core to the company
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.720]   that's actually coherent.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.440]   - You know, I think that happens in,
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.280]   I mean, I have the same, you know,
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.000]   I cover from the outside, you have this great inside access,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.240]   we cover from the outside Microsoft Apple,
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.920]   Google on all of our shows onto it,
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.000]   and really we're just kind of looking in from the outside,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.880]   we don't do any actual reporting or anything like that,
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.440]   we just sit here in cebits.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.280]   And I think that that's often the case.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.000]   I mean, I think it's very difficult to understand Microsoft
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   from the outside, it's very difficult to understand Apple
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:40.840]   from the outside.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.400]   We spend a lot of, it's a lot of it's criminalology,
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.720]   trying to understand from outward appearances
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.920]   what's going on internally.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.720]   So that's why I book like this is really valued
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.600]   because it gives us a really rare, unique peak
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.280]   into what's really going on inside.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.440]   And it's kind of opened my eyes in a lot of places.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.000]   So thank you for writing it.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.040]   - Great, well, thanks to all of you
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.200]   and I'll come back sometime.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.600]   That's the difference between slow journalism
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.080]   and fast journalism.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.920]   (laughing)
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.440]   - Yeah, I'll be sure glad you had the time
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.840]   you did to write this book, Steven.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.720]   - Yeah, thanks Steven, take care.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.560]   - Thanks a lot, bye bye.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.040]   - Steven Levy, and we're gonna let him go,
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.320]   but come back in just a bit with our tool and our tip
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.000]   and our number of the week.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.560]   But first a word from our friends at Netflix.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.840]   No, if you haven't yet signed up for a Netflix account,
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.760]   I don't know what's keeping you.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.680]   Netflix is amazing, I've been a member for 10,
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.920]   almost it'll be 11 years in December.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.520]   So I mean, I bought the,
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.880]   I drank the Netflix Kool-Aid a long time ago and I love it.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.560]   Netflix started and when I first joined was as DVD by Mail.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.680]   So you'd sign up, I get five DVDs, I'll show you my cue.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.600]   I get five DVDs in the mail.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.520]   And I have as long as I want to watch them
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.880]   and when I'm done, I send it back
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.080]   and then it picks the next title in my cue.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.760]   This was the thing that I think really sold me on
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.560]   Netflix is this idea of a cue.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.720]   So they have, like so the next movie,
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.600]   when I send the Smothers Brothers season three disc one back.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.600]   What are you laughing at?
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.880]   It is a little self revealing when you show your...
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.040]   You're dating yourself, man.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.160]   Do you see yourself as Dick or Tommy?
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.280]   Oh, I'm Tommy.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.120]   Yes.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:15.960]   You know what happened?
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   Actually, there's an interesting story.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.520]   His Andy Inaco told us about an audible book
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.280]   called Dangerously Funny by David B. and Cooley.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.800]   And I was so inspired by Tommy the Rebel.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:28.360]   I didn't really realize what was going on behind the scenes.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.040]   But he was very political and the reason he got censored
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.800]   at CBS is because he took every fight to the mat.
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.960]   And CBS finally said, "This is not worth it.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.760]   I don't care how good their ratings are."
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.080]   So after reading the book, I wanted to see the disc.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.720]   He's also a parent at our high school.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.080]   So my son, I'm so jealous.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.320]   My son was at a party.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.680]   His son is a senior at the high school at a party.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.280]   And Tommy came down and hung out with my son for an hour or two.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   Jesus.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.440]   And I'm saying, I'm saying, well, how was that?
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.280]   He said, "Oh, he's very funny."
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:07.280]   I said, "Oh, apparently he's very profane as well."
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.920]   Which if you read the book, doesn't surprise you.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.400]   So that's why I'm watching the Smothers Brothers.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.360]   But my next one, talk about revealing,
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.920]   will be snakes on a plane.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.760]   So I said--
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:17.760]   Oh.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.280]   Somehow I missed that movie when it was in the theaters.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.880]   And that's what Netflix is great for.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.760]   But I have to say, really, the best--
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.400]   lately, I haven't-- look, I've had the painted veil
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.840]   since January 3.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.200]   The reason is, I got to collect doing the watch instantly thing.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.240]   I watch something almost every night on Netflix
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.720]   without waiting for a DVD.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.880]   Even if it's a business day, I can watch the Terminator
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.400]   right away.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.960]   I don't have to wait.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.600]   In fact, these are recommendations.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.440]   Because of the movies and shows, the TV shows I've watched,
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.400]   this is what Netflix thinks I'd like to see next.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.560]   I actually have to say it's a pretty good list of--
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.040]   I never-- some of these I never heard of.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.160]   Some of them are classics.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.320]   So yeah, you go right there.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.080]   Rocko?
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.040]   What are you laughing at?
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:01.400]   That's why--
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.520]   I never would have known you as a romantic, Leo.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.080]   The greatest--
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:04.920]   I guess I guess I would have.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.360]   Of course I'm a romantic.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.000]   Of course, that's right.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.480]   The greatest movie of all time.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.600]   But anyway, that's just--
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.560]   the idea is you press a button on your Xbox 3.6,
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.360]   your PlayStation 3, your many Blu-ray players these days,
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.360]   many TVs these days, the Roku box, the Nintendo Wii,
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.800]   your computer, your iPad, your iPhone.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.160]   And you can watch these movies right away instantly.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.760]   You're never with that entertainment.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.000]   Some good new movies at Salt just came out.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.920]   Easy A, I'd missed that in the theaters, Hot Tub Time Machine,
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.560]   the graduate.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.160]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.000]   Easy A was really--
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:38.560]   Was it?
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.880]   Obviously the graduate.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.200]   But Easy A is great.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.320]   Oh, I'm just dying of seed.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:42.840]   I love the premise.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.360]   Yeah, it was good.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.640]   See, now I know what I'm watching tonight.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.120]   Yeah, the lead is really cute.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.920]   I forget her name.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.240]   I love her.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.040]   It's clean without music.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.800]   Yeah, basically.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.120]   It's a high school comedy.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   I just watched The Joneses with Demi Moore and David
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.600]   D'Acovneon Netflix.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.120]   See, I love David D'Acovneon.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.680]   I'm not sure I'm going to be more fan exactly.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.400]   No.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.200]   OK.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.240]   I like her.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.880]   She was really the reason to watch the movie.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.560]   Really?
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.520]   So you are Demi Moore fan.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.120]   I am.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:16.640]   I am.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.880]   I interviewed her years ago and she was in general hospital.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:20.400]   Oh, yeah?
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   Oh, very cute.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.400]   And still cute.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.440]   She hasn't actually aged.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.240]   I don't understand really--
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:25.840]   At all.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.320]   It's crazy.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.480]   I don't know how that works.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.760]   Camera likes her very much.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:36.240]   She was in that sexy movie where she was the stripper, right?
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:36.680]   Yes.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.200]   I watched that in watching.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.360]   See, you don't have to actually order a DVD.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.280]   The fact that she can do GI Jane and then do the sexy stripper
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.160]   movie is just--
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.840]   Yes, there you go.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.920]   That's it.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.160]   And see, that's the other thing that's great about Netflix.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.600]   You know, if you're in the mood for a trashy movie, watch it.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.560]   Just enjoy it.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.680]   Enjoy yourself.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.240]   Want to see the--
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:56.720]   Feel free.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.520]   You don't have to look the deep--
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.280]   Be sitting around.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.000]   You want to see the fast and the furious tonight?
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.560]   Go right ahead.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.360]   No one will ever know.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   Chat room 100 years of movies, and Leo
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.440]   chooses thanks on a plane.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.280]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.280]   I want you to try it free.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.640]   If you're not-- I don't know how you could not
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.720]   be a Netflix member, but if you're not, lucky us.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.640]   We get credit if you go to Netflix.com/twit.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.200]   Not twig, twit.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.920]   It's one coupon code for the whole network.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.320]   And sign up today for that 30-day free trial.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.200]   Even if you're already a member, one of the nice things
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.840]   about Netflix is you can buy a gift certificate for family
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.160]   and friends.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   I give my mom Netflix every year for her birthday.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.400]   She loves it.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.280]   I doubt she's watching snakes on a plane, but she loves it.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.040]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.920]   Give it a try.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.400]   Please, you're going to-- you'll thank me for it.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.200]   I know you will.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.680]   Time for our tool.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.400]   Oh, no.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:52.920]   I'm a tool.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.760]   You're a tip.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.560]   Time for--
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.560]   Exactly.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.040]   --to the tip of the week, Gina.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:05.000]   So another Gmail Labs tip this week, background send.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.840]   So Gmail's been getting a little slow lately.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.000]   You write a message.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.240]   You hit send, and you have to wait a couple seconds
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.480]   before it gets done.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.200]   I know this seems like a really small nitpicky thing
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.360]   to get upset about, but it adds up over time.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.840]   You send a lot of email.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.320]   So they just introduced in Gmail Labs' background send.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.000]   When you hit the send button, you get--
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.080]   you get-- return to your inbox instantly,
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.120]   and the sending happens kind of in the background.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.440]   So you can keep chatting or checking your mail
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.080]   or processing mail while the sending happens.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.120]   And it makes Gmail just a little feel, just a lot more
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:35.960]   snappier.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.680]   So if you go into your Gmail settings into labs,
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.360]   which there are a million great labs features,
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.840]   and I have-- I'm sure I have half of them enabled.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.320]   It's probably worth just checking labs every few days.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.040]   It is.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.400]   I mean, the Gmail blog does a good job of making announcements
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.880]   when they add new ones.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.560]   But yeah, background send, to hit enable.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.480]   And when you send mail, just don't log out until it's done.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.640]   And you'll see a little yellow status message
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.760]   saying, sending your message.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.640]   Cool.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.520]   Now Gmail's slow.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.640]   I can't get to the labs.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.880]   Oh, well, there it is.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.440]   Question question, guys.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.920]   I just noticed in the last week or so, maybe
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.200]   if this has been there for five years, then I've never seen it,
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.560]   is I start typing an email to Leola Port,
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.160]   and it says to me, would you like to include Junior Tappani?
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:17.920]   Yes.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.280]   I've been noticing that too.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.920]   That was a labs feature that they rolled into the full Gmail.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.040]   So a fragile email.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:23.360]   Great.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.240]   That's the what about Bob feature, I think.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.680]   What about Bob or the wrong bill or something like that?
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.040]   And it's pretty smart.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.680]   It is.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   It is.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.600]   It does two things.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.520]   It does the wrong Bob and what about Bob?
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.360]   So if the wrong Bob is if you send it to Bob Smith
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.000]   instead of Bob Jones, it says, you meant Bob Jones, didn't you?
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.720]   I don't know how it knows that.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.360]   But I guess based on your previous correspondence.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.000]   And then what about Bob if you leave somebody out of something
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.240]   that you normally would CC everybody?
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.920]   And that's what I want them to do is I want to be able to,
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.520]   as always, as Stephen said before,
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.280]   I want to export that data and visualize it.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:58.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.480]   That would be neat.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.240]   That would be really neat.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.720]   You know, this is always what I think about when
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.880]   we talk about Google and social.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.400]   Google knows so much about my private life based solely
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.120]   on my daily Gmail usage for the past five years
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.440]   and even my contacts.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.160]   So it's interesting.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.800]   It would be a little creepy if they did something.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.640]   I'm going to use creepy, the word that makes Jeff nuts.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.960]   If they did something about it because I have the expectation
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.520]   that that mail is private, right?
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.880]   It's not I'm not going to profile it.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.200]   I'm filling it out for public consumption.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.800]   Well, they could do it in your dashboard.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   I mean, I think that's one of the things that I would bet
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.320]   that dashboard is intended to do in the long run.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.240]   The idea behind Google Dashboard is to show you
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.280]   what Google knows about you.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.840]   But if you could export your contacts in clusters
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.400]   based on how you communicate with them,
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.520]   like you two would be my twig cluster.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.480]   That would be really cool.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.800]   I can see some of that right now.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.200]   Contact says most contacted.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.000]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.800]   Three people I send the most email to.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.480]   So I think that that's conceivable.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.400]   I mean, god, that's stuff I could find out about myself
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.560]   from looking at my latitude at location history.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.560]   I mean, how many hours I spend at work?
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.120]   You know, I mean, it's--
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.920]   Well, you don't need to let now Apple knows that.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.880]   And they will move it to every new iOS device you buy.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.800]   That was the part about it that bugged me.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.600]   It was that it got backed up and moved onto my new iOS devices.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.520]   Like, come on.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.200]   Well, they backed the whole thing up.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:21.960]   Well, right.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.520]   But I know.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.520]   Yeah, I know.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.000]   Transplant.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.600]   I want to know.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.160]   I want to know.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.160]   I'm not defending them.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:27.240]   Well, that's all.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.320]   It's so easy.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.280]   Let me give me knowledge and control.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.680]   And then everything's OK.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.240]   Not a dummy.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:32.960]   You can tell me.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.760]   I can take it.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.440]   I want to say it to Apple.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.400]   Maybe everything's OK.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.640]   Maybe the knee jerk reaction of 99% of the real people
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.080]   would be turn that off.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:43.560]   And--
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.840]   Yes, but hiding it these days is only going to get shot.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.800]   You shouldn't hide it.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.560]   You shouldn't hide it.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.600]   And then the Wall Street Journal
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.880]   come back like they discovered something.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.400]   Right.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:50.880]   Did you know?
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.120]   Well, that's what cracks me up.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.840]   Because, I mean, this stuff has always been a known.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.440]   I mean, I wasn't surprised.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.720]   It was-- I believe Apple and they said that was a bug.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.640]   They didn't mean to save it.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.920]   But of course, they're collecting that data.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.840]   Just like Google was collecting data about Wi-Fi access
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.080]   spots and GPS's with its street view,
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.720]   that's how you build those databases.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.200]   Right.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.080]   Anyway, enough.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.000]   Enough.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.800]   You're number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.120]   Thank you for not stealing it.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.040]   We didn't have a chance.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.920]   We hardly did any news.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.040]   39%.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.720]   That's how many people, according to Google,
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.000]   use their smartphones in the bathroom.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.600]   Show of hands.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.480]   That's on it.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.760]   I think it's 100% in this room.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.320]   Well, OK.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.720]   Smartphone and also iPad.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.840]   Tablet.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:39.520]   Not yet.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.360]   Really?
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.640]   But that's a good idea.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.760]   That's because men read in the bathroom.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.240]   Steve Jobs, when he was first asked about the notion
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.040]   of magnet tablets, says, I'm not going to make a bathroom
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.560]   device, he knew it.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:52.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.480]   He knew exactly what people wanted it for.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.720]   Well, this is a survey of smartphone usage by Google
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.360]   they put out.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.200]   And some other numbers, let's go down--
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.160]   How do they wait a minute?
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.520]   Do they know where my bathroom is?
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.000]   How are--
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.480]   Clearly.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.080]   Apparently, they're watching my location.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.960]   Good God, number two, they know.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.400]   Did you use the EcoFlash, Mr. Travis?
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.520]   You used two gallons on that.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.480]   We're actually contemplating, if you come out
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.560]   for our grand opening of the new studio,
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.480]   we are currently in hot negotiations with Kohler
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.720]   for their super new heavy duty toilet
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.920]   that when you get near it, it opens up for you.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.120]   And it has remote control and it plays music.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.400]   And it bathes you in all sorts of scented chemicals.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.200]   Is it Wi-Fi?
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.560]   Does it do anything with Wi-Fi or what I know?
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.240]   I'm sure if it could, it would.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:46.840]   I don't know.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.560]   I'll check.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.480]   Is it like blow dry?
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.000]   Blow dry?
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.160]   Your bottom, when you're done?
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.080]   Blow chop's your bottom.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.320]   That was a Freudian slip.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   I'm not going to go there.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:55.640]   It was.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640]   It really was.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   And by the way, we have a title.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.200]   I suppose I should cut that out.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.720]   Let me show you my foetus camera is so good,
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720]   it's just so we're blushing.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.960]   She's blushing.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.440]   The entire chat room is like all the way right now.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.160]   So OK, fine.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.640]   I'll take that.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.160]   Oh, man.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.280]   It was a good line.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.960]   And I didn't let you get away with it either.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960]   Because--
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:23.440]   You did not.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.160]   I could have ignored that and moved on
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.120]   and talked about my phone.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.600]   But no!
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.800]   So I do have a tool.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.040]   First of all, I'm going to show you the tool on the new G2X,
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.120]   which we were talking about.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.360]   It really is all that and more.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:41.720]   The G2X is the new T-Mobile Google Experience phone
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.600]   that is running a Tegra 2, so it's dual core.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.680]   And, Gina, you really could see the speed.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.640]   I mean, it just really feels fast and lively.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.080]   And I've talked about it before.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.440]   Now, I have to say, I'm very excited because I found an app
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.440]   for it that I really like.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.040]   That's free right now.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.160]   If you go right now to the Amazon App Store,
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.560]   usually the free apps like Doodle Jump.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.280]   But everyone's found something you actually want.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.080]   This is an alternative calendar that I never heard of.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.800]   It's a $5 program normally.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.120]   It's free right now from Macado Software
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.360]   called Business Calendar.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.880]   And I really, really like it.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.480]   It has a very nice set of widgets to use.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.760]   You see, I've got a little mini widget down here.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.440]   That's the calendar.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.520]   It has a lot of very nice features
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.880]   that improve on the Android calendar.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:33.120]   Of course, it syncs automatically with the Google calendar.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.320]   There's the month view, which the Android calendar does not do.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.560]   You can also just have colored bars
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.640]   if you want to just get an idea of--
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.560]   let me see if I can get that done.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.440]   Oh, I guess I do it here.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.360]   Yeah, show bars.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.040]   If you just want to get an idea of your busy time--
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.360]   but I like to show text.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.600]   You see all the categories and tabs down below,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.080]   which is really nice.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.480]   Makes it very easy.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.400]   Here's a week view.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.760]   The day view is also excellent.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.200]   You can edit events directly in there.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.920]   I just think it's a little bit of a better calendar.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.400]   I don't know if I'd pay five bucks for it.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.120]   Actually, I think I probably would.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.720]   I've paid some money for some expensive calendars in the past.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.120]   Look, I can jam more or fewer days.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.200]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:10.520]   Look at that.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.240]   Is that a slider?
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.320]   Oh, very nice.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.440]   This is really-- yeah, this is really nicely done.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.320]   I just hit Buy with One Click.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.200]   Get Now with One Click on my next one.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.080]   Nice.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.960]   And it's free.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.840]   I have to say, every day now I go to the Amazon App Store.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.400]   I always want to see what they're offering,
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.520]   because they have so many good things for free.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.040]   And so I just kind of--
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.680]   yesterday I downloaded a couple of days ago,
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.160]   TuneIn Radio Pro, which is still only $99.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.560]   Absolutely the best radio program I've ever seen.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:44.640]   So in and amongst the bubble level, angry birds,
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.760]   and doodle jump, there's occasionally something--
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.680]   There are some gems.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.560]   Something that you actually want.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.760]   And I think today is a good one.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.040]   If you're hearing this after the fact,
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.280]   well, you'll have to decide if it's worth $499.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.160]   You could try it for 15 minutes free.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:58.560]   Crazy.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.480]   15 minutes.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.000]   Hey, the Google Docs, the official Google Docs,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.400]   native app for Android, also came out.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.880]   We should say that pretty quick.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.440]   Oh, days, Leo, that you didn't pick that.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.920]   I didn't know about it.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.800]   Yeah, so the cool thing that it does is that it does OCR.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.560]   So you take a picture with your camera,
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.120]   and you upload it to Google Docs,
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.920]   and it does its best to OCR, the do optical character
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.000]   recognition, and translate it to text.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.200]   I did a quick test right before the show,
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.840]   and I actually took a photo of my computer screen
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.520]   of the blog post announcing this.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.800]   And I left a link to it in the doc.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.400]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:33.800]   I'll leave this.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.880]   Google Docs for Android.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.720]   She's got it in there.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.800]   Let me just check.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.520]   So this is the blog post.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.200]   But you put in our doc, you put--
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.960]   I can't believe I missed this.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.320]   I'm so stupid.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.840]   I took a picture of the screen, and then uploaded it
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.920]   just to see what the text recognition would be like.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.200]   And it's OK.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.800]   There are some g's that are cues, and that
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.720]   kind of thing.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.520]   But yeah, it's a pretty cool app.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.560]   So the Google Docs app just search for Google Docs
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.280]   in the market.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.480]   And we're in the-- oh, here's the photo example.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.400]   I got it right here from you.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.160]   Let me open this up and paste this in,
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.240]   because it didn't convert it to a link,
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.200]   because it sometimes does.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.200]   Have you noticed that sometimes in spreadsheet,
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.440]   it doesn't convert it to a link?
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.240]   Yeah, I think maybe I didn't--
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.640]   Yeah, you got to press a button.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.120]   And there are--
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.520]   Leave this page.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.920]   Leave this page.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.760]   So there it is.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.560]   And so that's the photo.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.800]   And then if you scroll down, that's the text.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.520]   That's a hard test to it a screen.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:27.840]   It is.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.360]   I wanted to give it a test test test test test test.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.120]   It did a good job.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.200]   Yeah, I mean, a magazine would probably do a better job.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.640]   I mean, look how hard that would be to read.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.360]   And I think it did a very good job.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.760]   Yeah, yeah, I mean--
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.320]   Certainly usable.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.160]   You know what I want them to do is to do a transcript
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.720]   of any audio I give them.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.640]   Yeah, if they could do that, they have a very good--
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.800]   Yeah, they do.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.640]   Well, YouTube doesn't do such a good job.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.640]   But they certainly seem to know what I'm saying.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.160]   I don't know how they do.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.520]   All right, so there you go.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.640]   I apologize for leaving that.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.880]   I know about it, but I'm downloading it right now too.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.240]   So there's a few tips for you.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.600]   And yes, the G2X nice phone, 4-inch screen,
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.440]   very fast, good battery life, same as all the other--
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.560]   Droid X and all of those other phones.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.560]   In other words, not enough if you use it constantly.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.040]   But if you can keep it plugged in every once in a while,
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:19.760]   plug it in.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.000]   I think you'll be pretty happy with it.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.360]   And boy, I just love this phone.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   And it's a native Google experience, which
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   means no other stuff on here.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.120]   Still 2.2.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.840]   Someday, they'll update it.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.880]   They say they're going to update it soon.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.520]   Gina Trapani is at smarter where--
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.320]   The R-rated Gina Trapani.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.680]   Whoa.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.280]   Man.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.720]   Leo will get to meet Potty Mouthe me at FooCalf.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:47.720]   Get away!
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.720]   Ah, offline.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.800]   She'll be a villa-chiller.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.040]   And it's intentional offline.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.640]   It's not a slip.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.520]   It's not a Freudian slip.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.440]   It is not a Freudian slip.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.440]   Always a pleasure, Gina.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.680]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.880]   Just the great show today.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.120]   I can't wait to see you in FooCalf.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.680]   Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.560]   Jeff Jarvis, I'm going to see him too.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.480]   And a little sooner, we're going to see him in--
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.520]   A parry?
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.520]   La bel paillie.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.120]   Jeff is at--
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:11.840]   They're pictures.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.080]   --buzzmachine.com, we will.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.520]   And his book--
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.040]   Oh, I guess we threw it out.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.680]   Oh, I see that.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:21.880]   I was kidding.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.600]   I know.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.920]   What would Google--
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.240]   I know.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.360]   No, you got to read them both.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.640]   You got to read them both.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.920]   This is journalism about the inside of Google.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.320]   This is philosophy that is still very germane today.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.320]   I mean, it's exactly what we talk about it on the show.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.840]   And if you love the show and love Jeff's insights on the show,
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.520]   you'll love the book, What Would Google Do.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.960]   Leo's very nice way of saying it's BS, but that's fine.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.720]   It's not BS.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.920]   Well, hey.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.440]   Flather.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.880]   If I call BS on this, what is my network?
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.240]   It is all BS.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.440]   It is the Blather Network.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.760]   But that's fine.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.400]   Somebody's got to do it.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:58.960]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.440]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.360]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.880]   We do the show every Wednesday.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.760]   Yes, it is Wednesday, isn't it?
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.280]   We do it at 11-- I'm sorry, 1 p.m.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.880]   Pacific time, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.920]   Live.twit.tv.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.960]   You can watch it then.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.920]   Or always after the fact, just go to iTunes or anywhere
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.120]   and search for Twig.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.800]   In fact, if you go to twit.tv/twig,
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.680]   we've got a list of all the places you can get it.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.360]   Absolutely free.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.920]   Thanks to our fine advertisers and you, the people.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.600]   Have a great week.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.360]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.880]   You
