[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640]   How about that? I've got attitude now.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   Mostly because I got the smartest people in the world on this show.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640]   And if they want to talk about, I don't know, Microsoft Surface?
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   Or if they want to talk about Samsung Tech Tile?
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   I don't care.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640]   Whatever you want to talk about.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.640]   Nominally it's about Google, the cloud, Facebook, that kind of thing.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   We're going to start with Gina Trepani.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.640]   Founding editor of LifeHacker.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   She now has her own blog at smarterwhere.org.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640]   And works for expert labs where she develops ThinkUp app.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.640]   Or ThinkUp, which is an app that synthesizes social media information into.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   You're big data now, baby.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   You're in the big data realm.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   Oh, yeah. I just dropped a 10 million row table this morning and then realized my backups were bad.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   So, yeah.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   Oh!
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   Oh!
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   Two!
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   Hurt.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   It hurt.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   How?
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   Luckily my app can recapture the data.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   But yeah, it was one of those things.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   Check your backups.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   TSA.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   Holy moly.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   I'm surprised you're not balling your eyes out.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   I wouldn't.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   It was one of those mornings.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640]   It was not a critical table.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   It could have been a worse table.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   It was a little secondary.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.640]   If you didn't really need it, 10 million rows, just think of it as cost cutting.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   You know, it's just I'm trying to be real zan about it.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   Nothing is really ours.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   It's a theme role.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   That's right.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   You're right sizing.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640]   In 100 years, no one will know.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640]   [laughter]
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com, the author of Public Parts.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   He's back home finally.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   You've been traveling everywhere in the world.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   So, I'm just subjecting you to bad bandwidth the world around.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   Well, now we've got a new bad bandwidth king.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   [laughter]
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   So, Jeff joined us via all sorts of strange devices from all around the world.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   Now, it's Kevin Marks, turn Kevin Marks, who is at Salesforce, right?
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   Yes.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   And of course, host the great Tummel Vision at TummelVision.tv.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.640]   He's outside Salesforce today at the beautiful fairy plaza in San Francisco via 4G.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   Look at that.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   It's gorgeous.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   Don't move the camera too much, Kevin.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   [laughter]
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   I think the problem is this is rising for a GSP really good.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   Then everyone got iPads that connect to it.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   Everything's good when no one uses it, Kevin.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   That's the--
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   I've got 22 new iPads in this building.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   The dirty little secret of bandwidth.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.640]   As long as no one's using it, it's great.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   So, I got to start because we-- boy, there really is a lot to talk about today.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   Windows-- Microsoft had two big announcements this week.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   Google I/O is next week.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   And a week ago, Apple had WWDC.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   This is like the season of announcements, and it's really fascinating stuff.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   I almost don't know what to make of it.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   That's why I've got the big brains here.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.640]   But let's start.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   This is kind of a funny little video that was created by-- was it Read/Write/Re-Write/Web?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   The site that I can never--
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   Read/Write/Hub, really hard to say.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   Never pronounce Read/Write/Web.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   Consonants.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.640]   Yeah, consonants.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   So Leo, I was in a restaurant in Boston the other night,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   and a Mexican restaurant, and I had a margarita, which I rarely do.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   And so I know this is the power of Leo Report.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   As I was about to leave, another drink arrived with a note saying,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   "We like your work."
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   So it's your-- the hangover the next morning was your fault.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   No, don't blame me.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   They didn't mention me by name.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   This is why I do twig.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   This is the free drinks.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   Do not blame me.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   I couldn't read the head raise.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.640]   Wherever you are, thank you, I think.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   I think they could be a fan of your-- maybe they were former students.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   They could be a fan of your buzz machine.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   They could be a fan of the public parts.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   What would Google do?
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   You got a lot of work.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   I'm not responsible for you.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.640]   After that moment, everything I said sounded like Re-Way Web.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   We won't-- We won't--
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   Don't say that drunk.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.640]   All right, here we go.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   This is from Read/Write/Web, a mashup, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.640]   I certainly want to thank everybody for coming today.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   We've reimagined-- redefining the reimagination.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.640]   Reimagined for reimagining the tablet.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   This is the new Microsoft Surface.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   We call it the iPad.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640]   That's what it looks like.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.640]   Surface is super thin.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.640]   iPad is really thin.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   It's a 10.6 inch, 9.7 inch, optically bonded IPS display.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   At under 1.5 pounds.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.640]   Just 1.5 pounds.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   Dual 2x2 MIMO antennas.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.640]   The latest in wireless networking.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   It's got a 30-pin connector full-size USB port.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   A keyboard dock.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.640]   A full multi-touch keyboard.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   Browsing the web.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640]   I can browse smoothly.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   And I'm just going to go to Safari.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   Oops.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   Oh, yeah, by the way, Stephen had a little trouble.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   He crashed it.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   He had to bring that one back to the table and get a new one.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   Oops.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   Excuse me, just a second.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   Hey, sorry.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   You never saw jobs do this.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   I mean, he does look like it.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   Surface works great for entertainment as well.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   Video, video, music, music, games, gaming.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   Lay back and watch a movie.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   A great way to watch movies.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   And that's really what entertainment should be about.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.640]   It feels natural in your hands.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   It's phenomenal to hold the internet in your hand.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.640]   It actually sits perfectly comfortable in your hands.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   It feels great in your hands.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   It's really great.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   Great.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   This is a great choice for you.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   It's so much more intimate.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   It just fits there.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   Tremendous breath.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   Click.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.640]   Magical.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   Click.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   Revolutionary.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   One of a kind.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   He had a very aggressive price school.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.640]   $499.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   And we'll have a retail price comparable with competitive ultra book class PCs.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   Unbelievable.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   We believe that any intersection between human and machine.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   The intersection of technology and liberal arts.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   And you know, we're just getting started.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   And we hope you love the iPad as much as we do.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.640]   You'll never want to go back.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.640]   That's the complete surface family.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   Woo!
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   Interesting.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   Now that, I don't think they were intending that to be a, uh, read right.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.640]   Well, it was intending that to be humorous.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   But they were comparing, this was the original iPad launch in, uh, in 2010, 28 months ago,
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   with the launch of the Surface, which is still not available.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   It's unclear when it'll be available, but probably sometime around Windows 8, which is,
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.640]   they said when Windows 8 goes RTM, which is going to be available only in there, like, three stores, right?
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   Well, I'm sure you'll be able to get it.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   You won't be able to get it from Dell or Lenovo.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   There's one in my, there's a Microsoft store in my mall around here, Brickwater.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   And it's sad.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.640]   Do you remember the Seinfeld episode, Bizarro episode?
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   Yes, it is Bizarro Apple Store.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   It's Bizarro Apple.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   Yeah, it's so weird.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   But I don't want to be an Apple, the traditional Apple bigot and say, oh, we were there first.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   We did it first.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   Oh, look, they've got a magnet.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   Isn't that clever?
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.640]   The keyboard looks really cool, though.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640]   I think there's stuff to say.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   It's an interesting take on a laptop, right?
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   Yes, it is.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   Yes, it is.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.640]   Well, it's been a laptop because you can't put it on your laptop.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   Oh, you're good point.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   It isn't actually a laptop.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   It's a little fluffy.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   So it has to be.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.640]   Yeah, the keyboard is a touch keyboard.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.640]   There are two keyboards.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   There's one that's --
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   [laughter]
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.640]   It's known in San Francisco.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640]   [laughter]
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   Whereas --
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   One 30p.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   But it's very much like that, which is an iPad with the Logitech Ultra Thin.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   That's a cover.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   It becomes a stand.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   And I think that one thing Microsoft learned is, look, people do want keyboards on their
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   tablets.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   And the reason I say it's a laptop is there's really two of these surfaces.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:38.640]   There's a Windows RT ARM-based one, which is essentially a real tablet, much like the iPad.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   And it only runs Metro applications.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   It does not run Windows applications per se.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.640]   And then there's a -- they call it a Windows 8 Pro Surface, which is running Windows 8,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.640]   the actual operating system, and will run Windows apps.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   And that's a very big difference.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   One is going to cost more like a laptop.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   That's the one that's comparable to an UltraBook.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   One is comparable, supposedly.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   Competitors, what they said.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.640]   And lower-end will not run native apps.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   Not native Windows apps.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.640]   No, so one of the things Microsoft has said about Windows RT is, you will have to be a Metro app.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.640]   Now, as a developer, you can write a Metro app for Windows and press a button and say,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   "That's also going to be available on the tablet."
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.640]   But as it stands right now, this is another tablet with no apps.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   Okay.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   Right.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:33.640]   So before I knew that, I thought the only reason for me to look lustily at the Surface was if I could run,
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.640]   store, and then share through Dropbox real Microsoft Word documents.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   Yes, you probably can, because it will ship with not a full version, but a trial version of Office for Windows RT.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   Both versions of the tablet.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   Yes.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   That's what it is.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   I think so.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   Do you think that the integration with the Microsoft sort of ecosystem alone, just the Office apps and SharePoint and SkyDrive,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   like just that alone will be compelling enough for people to buy it?
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   I know some people who work at huge organizations and live with Office and do all their work through Office.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.640]   And having a tablet that instantly connects to Exchange and has all the sort of rich features that the Microsoft Suite offers
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   would be good enough alone.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.640]   That's always been how Microsoft sold non-PCs.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   That's how they sold Windows Phone.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   It's still how they would sell Windows Phone.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.640]   And it's not compelling enough for Windows Phone to be even close to competitive with Android and iPhone.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   Right.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   But it is how they...
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   It's their lock-in.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   You know, Apple has a lock-in too.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   Let's not ignore it.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   But their lock-in and business is.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   Works in a Windows environment.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:49.640]   And Microsoft is not motivated to finally make Word operate on the iPad.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   But now Apple is oddly motivated to make Word documents smoother.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   And Google too, remember, Google bought QuickOffice.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   Right.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   So the Google Docs can work with...
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   Yeah, Microsoft has that weird problem where it's like on one side Enterprise and on the other side Xbox,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   you know, and a wildly successful on both ends.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   They're so different, but then all the stuff in the middle kind of isn't there yet.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   Well, and the real challenge for Windows 8 in general is going to be business.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.640]   I think business is going to stay with Windows 7.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   And I think that that is underlying why Microsoft can do this because, you know, one of the challenges of this is if Microsoft...
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.640]   This is a huge change in Microsoft's business model.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640]   They've never made PCs.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   They've always licensed an operating system to PC makers.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   The only hardware they made was Xbox and, you know, mice and keyboard, but Xbox.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.640]   So now they're competing with all of their...
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.640]   They're competing with the channel.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   And now there's two reasons they can do that.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.640]   I think one is that they recognize business is going to stay with Windows 7.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.640]   So the channel will continue, you know, Lenovo and Dell and everybody else will continue to say,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   "I think Windows 7 is going to last a lot longer than let's say XP or this."
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   That's really weird.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   Because if you're Michael Dell, don't you say, "Okay, you just left me in the past."
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   But what is Michael Dell going to do?
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   What can Michael Dell do?
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   Where does he go?
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   Well, he hopes that his operations doesn't compete with him.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640]   He has to...
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   Is he going to...
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640]   He can't...
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   Was he going to become a Linux house?
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   Yeah, like what's he going to do?
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.640]   What's he going to do?
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.640]   And that's the other part of that.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   There's two pieces and that's the second piece is Microsoft's basically saying,
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.640]   "What are you going to do?"
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   Well, he could become a Chrome house.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   No, a Chrome house.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640]   Chrome OS.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   Yes.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   Maybe.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   Dell could sell servers.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   Dell could go, you know, maybe high-end.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   Lenovo, what does Lenovo do?
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.640]   What does Acer do?
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   What does all these companies that are living in the Microsoft ecosystem do?
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   They can't give up.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   They have to continue to sell Windows, right?
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   And there's those who say, and I think this might also be true, that as, in fact,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   one of the guys who said this was the CEO was an Aesu, or Aesu.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.640]   I think it was the CEO of Aesu said, "Oh, don't worry.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   We're not worried."
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.640]   As soon as we start shipping our tablets, Microsoft will step back.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.640]   This is just to kind of prime the pump.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.640]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.640]   That is, do we wish that Google would do this?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.640]   I'll interpret Kevin.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:23.640]   He said, "Maybe this is why they're being cagey about the price because they don't want to hurt the channel, Kevin."
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.640]   Right.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.640]   It may be that they're saying, "We're doing the example, they can be for the loan."
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.640]   It's almost a reference platform.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.640]   They've had some success with Windows Phone by being very specific about what the hardware should be.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   There isn't any variety among Windows phones.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.640]   Very impressively, though, that you speak 4G.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   I'm learning.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   It started with you.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.640]   You gave me my first training.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   But Gina, you raised a very interesting point.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   Next week, we're going to see Google, and some of the rumors are that Google will do the same thing.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   We'll say, "We're going to make an Android tablet because none of you seem to have a clue about what to do."
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   I am dying for Google to do this.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   I want Google to do this.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   I want Google to issue the ultimate best reference Nexus tablet that's like acts as sort of instructive to the rest of the manufacturers.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   This is what the tablet experience should be like.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.640]   They've already done that with Android phones, with Nexus.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   Right.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.640]   Right.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   So I want my Nexus tablet.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   That's what I'm hoping for.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   I bet you, I would be willing to bet 5 to 5 to 1.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   That's what they're going to do.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   You think we're going to get one?
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   You are, because I'm going to be here anchoring.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   Stop, stop, stop, stop, grining, Gina.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   Jeff and I, are you going to be able to join us for our Google I/O keynote conference?
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   I won't know until I get to the schedule.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.640]   Okay.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   Well, Kevin, I'm sure you will.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.640]   And so we'll do breaking news.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640]   I'm going to take it though.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   You can give me Jeff's ticket.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   We're going to send you there, actually.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   We're going to try to, we have to talk to Google and see if we can do a...
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.640]   You have to grow a beard and go to Google.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.640]   Right.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   I took about Gutenberg.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640]   Yes.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.640]   Just Gutenberg and Habermas it all the way.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   You'll be safe.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   But Gina will be there and then we'll do what we normally do.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.640]   And in this case, Google makes it easy because they provide a stream of the keynote.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   Last year there were two keynotes, two successive days, with lots of information in both.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   I'm not sure how we'll handle that if they're going to do that.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   But they haven't said, have they, Gina?
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.640]   We don't even really know what's going to happen at Google I/O.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.640]   We don't.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   Well, the session schedule for developers is up on the site.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.640]   But those sessions start at 11.45 on both Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   But...
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   And there's nothing in the time slot from 9 or 10 to 11.45.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   So I think we will presume that there will be a day one keynote and a day two keynote from 9 or 10 until 11.45.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   What do you think we're going to see at Google I/O?
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640]   We're a reference tablet.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   That would be...
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   Because Android tablets are just stalled.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.640]   They have not...
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   The only effect down, the only one we know is the success is the Kindle Fire, which in no way mentions Android or Google.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.640]   Right.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.640]   Right.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   Yeah, the reference tablet.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   I mean, I'm hoping to see...
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.640]   If not...
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:09.640]   If they don't hand out the glasses, I would like to at least see a demo or an announcement about glasses, about project glass during the keynotes.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   I'm sure that they will.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   They've been wearing them everywhere.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   I mean, sure they have been.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.640]   They have been.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.640]   So, I think it's a tablet and Google TV.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   I think we're going to hear about as well.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   I bet they're going to release a new or announce a new Google TV set top box.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   Lots of rumors about that.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   Yep.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   And they may do...
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   And they may do...
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.640]   I think I'm hoping for...
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   I mean, as a developer, I'm hoping that they're going to announce that Google Plus has a real API by real and read-write.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   Huge.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.640]   You know, a lot more methods that are currently available.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.640]   I think it's almost too late.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.640]   Oh, really?
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.640]   Interesting.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.640]   Do you think it's too late for Google Plus in general?
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.640]   I think that it's too late for Google Plus to hopefully develop.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   As far as I can tell, the only reason Google Plus is even still around is because you just get it automatically.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   And they're insistent about it.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   Flipboard is an ask that they're going to put Google Plus and Flipboard.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   Whoo!
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   Yeah, it's not overwhelmed by that.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   Flipboard right now is driven by Twitter.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:12.640]   So basically, what happens with Flipboard is it turns your Twitter stream, all the links in your Twitter stream or others, Twitter streams or whatever, into a magazine with it.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   And it's a beautiful way to do it.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   It's actually brilliant.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   And you know, it will work well with Google Plus, especially if you follow photographers.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   There'll be a great, you know, a lot of photographers use it.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.640]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   I'll be honest.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   I forget about Google Plus a lot, but when I do go there, I see a lot of content mostly from people in our tribe.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   So mostly from journalists and tech writers and developers.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.640]   Well, that's who you follow, though.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.640]   That's who I follow, and that's who follows me.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.640]   And, you know, when I get that it hasn't penetrated beyond that community as much, although photographers are taking advantage of it and stuff.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   But I don't know.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   I still, it's hard to hear people say that, you know, it's dead or no one's putting content there when I see, you know, I do this content.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.640]   Oh, no, there's a lot of content.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   Although every time I look at it, I go, "Who are these people?"
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640]   [laughter]
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   I circled these people.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640]   Who are they?
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   But it's good content.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   I just think it's a, it's a, it's a small, it's a much smaller group than anybody wants to acknowledge.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.640]   Right.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   It's starting to feel more and more like buzz.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   I hate to say it.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   It's busier than buzz.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.640]   And it's beautiful.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   I mean, I love the G+ app.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   Yeah, the G+ mobile app is really nice.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   Let me just call it.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   So you're in charge of Google+.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   What the hell do you do?
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:30.640]   I think it's really, I think what you have to say is really telling is that Google has had three shots at social networks.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   One, the predates Facebook or CUT.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.640]   Another buzz that was just an abomination.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   It was born, still born, partly because of the privacy, whether spurious or not, the privacy concerns with its launch.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   And a third now that they have thrown the entire might of Google behind.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.640]   I mean, in a way, you know, many companies never do behind a single product.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.640]   They've made so, your bonuses are based on the word social at Google this year.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:04.640]   And despite all of that, they don't have the traction Facebook has out of the box nowhere.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   Do you disagree, Kevin?
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.640]   No, they don't have the traction Facebook has.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.640]   I think that they are playing a longer game and they're trying to fit a lot of things together.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   And what we see as G+ is one aspect of this.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:24.640]   I suspect the chunk of what we see at I/O is this idea of integrating these pieces together across much more of Google and that making more sense.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:31.640]   So that it shows up in other parts where at the moment they've got little bits around the edges but they haven't integrated many products.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   I suspect we'll see a tighter integration with Android.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.640]   We'll see some better integration with Docs and with YouTube and with the other major properties.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   And that will be part of what they do.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   And that is if they launch an API for this.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.640]   They've been sort of hedging on that for far too long and big talking about pollution and so on.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   But they've said they're going to bet this strategy on integrating this stuff across the company and joining different products out.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.640]   So I suspect we'll see some of that at I/O next week.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   The more they do that the more it feels forced to me.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:12.640]   The thing is, Google's had so many products for so long that weren't focused on community but that communities had built up around them.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   So like YouTube, you connect with your friends, reader, blogger, Gmail.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   I mean a lot of big not search but most of their flagship products had some sort of social element.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   They were all just disconnected.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   So maybe Google+ is just about connecting those.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   That's what we saw with the privacy policy consolidation.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   That's what we see with the plus mechanism sort of propagating throughout these other products.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   It's true that they've failed with every product that they've tried to make solely about social.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   Here's Google's social product.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.640]   But every single one of Google's products has some element of social to it except for search.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.640]   Until search plus your world.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   YouTube is a really good example of a big social network.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.640]   Thriving, crazy community going on on YouTube.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   But you have a huge risk too because if you start, and I think they feel this way because they've been very slow to integrate YouTube into Google+.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   And in fact you don't see a Google+ you don't see the plus bar on YouTube.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.640]   And I think there's some real nervousness in both directions.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   I want to bring all those YouTubers who are somewhat less mature perhaps into Google+.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   And then there's this also this thing that you could kill YouTube, the vibrant YouTube community.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   It's like mixing a salt water and a fresh water aquarium.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   True.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   Yes.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.640]   Well the challenge YouTube has always had is that it hasn't had good tools for growing community on it.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.640]   So it ends up being like the world's worst-channel.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.640]   And they've been getting gradually better at that but it's still not great.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   And that's the piece they need to fix because the YouTube community is very messy.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.640]   Now the bridge they've got there is Hangouts.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   And the Hangouts have fairly good moderation controls.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   You can create the live streams and then pipe those YouTube later.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   So they do have a gateway going that way.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   And you can share YouTube videos on blast.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   But you're right, it still feels a bit arm's length.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   I'm going to go the other way.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   I'm actually using Facebook less and less and less and less.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   Why?
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.640]   And I end up because I just don't find conversations there.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   It's repetitive to Twitter which I used to do too.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.640]   So I see the same people who I'm interested in here.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.640]   I'm interested in there.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   It kind of gives me just a small smattering of what's going on I think.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.640]   It seems a little slow.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   Whereas Google+ maybe it's just because it's the home of Geeks but I see more there.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.640]   Well and I do think that that's, you know, that's always the issue with the social network.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.640]   As soon as it's up to the public, people like us go, "Oh, I wouldn't do it."
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.640]   Nobody goes there.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   And one of the reasons people like us like Google+ is because it is Geeks.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   Google engineers pretty much for the most part.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   And so the quality level is, I'll grant you very high at Google+.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   But I don't think it's a real social network.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   I think Twitter is showing some really kind of surprising legs in this.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   There was an interesting presentation from the web this morning in California time,
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   a later afternoon, London time from Josh Elman talking about how they changed
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   the online web.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   So I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.

[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   I think it's a very interesting presentation.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   It's just my tweets without my conversation.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.640]   It took out, by doing so, it took out, I don't know, tons of posts.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   A lot of what I say on Twitter is @ replies.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   I've had people complain about that and maybe this is what their response is.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   People bitch because I'm at replying publicly.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   They say, "You know, if you don't start it with a word but you start it with the @ reply,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   we won't have to see that crap."
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   I say, "I know how to use Twitter.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   I'm doing that because I think my response is of a more general interest."
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   Yeah, you put the dot when you want everyone to see it.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   I try to do it a little more elegantly.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.640]   I'm responding to Om Malek who's saying something about how Twitter for the Mac is crap.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   I say, "Hah Om."
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   Instead of just saying Om, I say, "Hah."
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   I kind of like the elegant evidence of Twitter for the Mac though.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   I make a point when I do that of putting context so that you can read that.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   It's not just, "Yes."
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   Sometimes it's not a reply.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.640]   Sometimes I'm asking somebody a question or a question like that.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   That's gone.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.640]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   It doesn't matter.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   Well, if you're verified, you're not so you don't have to worry about it.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.640]   But if you're verified, dot doesn't make any difference.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.640]   If it has an @ in it, let me look at that.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   It hasn't added at all.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.640]   Yes.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   It's all the stuff with ads is gone.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.640]   No.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   No.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.640]   Well, not in my case.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   It took all of this stuff out.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   Like where I said, "hot @omgon."
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.640]   Wow.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   You clicked on reply.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   Here's part of the reason for that is so it becomes a PR mechanism.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   It's just the messages you want to send out.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   Well, here's an interesting one.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   I think I'm going to go back to a -- God, I hope this doesn't get funded on Kickstarter.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   A couple of people want to do a folk album on the moon and they're trying to raise $21 million.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   And I pledged $1,000 because I thought they'll never make it.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   So Kickstarter tweets it.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640]   Yeah, it could be in trouble, right?
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   You know what?
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   If they can raise $21 million, then I'll be glad to give them $1,000.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   So it tweets that and it did put @kickstarter in that tweet.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   So you're right, Gina.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   It's probably because I've been pressing reply.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   But I don't know.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.140]   When you press reply, there's a field that gets attached to your tweet in reply to post
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.140]   ID.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.640]   And that's how Twitter recognizes and API developers recognizes that it is a reply.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   So if you click reply and then even edit the tweet so that it doesn't start with the username,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.640]   it still looks like a reply.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.640]   And that's why it is.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   So this is good.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   So this is a little workaround.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.640]   You could just edit it without the reply thing.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.640]   Right.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.640]   Like, don't click reply.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   Just start a new tweet and say, "Ha!" at home.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   Have you guys seen Branch?
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.640]   Speaking of curated conversations with the special people and...
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   Let's take a break and we'll talk about that.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   We're going to ask about something else about Twitter.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   We'll ask about Twitter.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640]   We'll ask about Twitter.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   And NASCAR.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   That's a huge, by the way, little blog post of Twitter, kind of some coverage.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   No, this is a massive change in Twitter.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.640]   And I think there's a lot...
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   People will notice that Twitter looks very different all of a sudden if you follow a lot
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.640]   of authorized accounts.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   Including me.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   I think it's becoming more of an advertising medium.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   It's become a broadcast medium.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   But first, you need to do your ads.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.640]   But first, a word from stamps.com.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.640]   Speaking of broadcast mediums, I got to pay the bills here.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   And the way we pay the bills is with our fine sponsors.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   And we pick them very carefully.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   We hand select our sponsors because we want to make sure that we are talking about a product
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.640]   that you are, A, going to be interested in, and B, that we have used and like.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   We don't do advertisements for anything that we don't use and like.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   And stamps.com is a really good example.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   I've been using stamps.com for years long before we did the ads for them.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   Because it's so cool.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.640]   It lets you print US postage from your computer.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   You don't go to the post office anymore.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   The post office comes to you.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   stamps.com lets you print postage.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   The minute you need it, it's always the right postage because you use those USB scales to
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.640]   give you.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   And I'll tell you how you can get that scale.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   Plug it in the computer.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.640]   You plop the letter on there.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   It'll even print it on the envelope, which looks very nice.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   Better than a post, what do they call it?
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   A postal meter mark.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.640]   In fact, you don't need a postage meter.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640]   You don't need special links or anything.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.640]   You're just printing with your printer right on the envelope.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   Or, if for a package, you could even buy sticky labels that it'll print on to if you want
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   like traditional stamps.

[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   The mail carrier comes and gets the mail.

[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   Well, maybe you do it open the door.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   Stamps.com.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.640]   Give it a try today.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   All right.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   Who's first?
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.640]   Jeff, you wanted to say something?
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.640]   Let me just say one more bit on Twitter, Gina, then I absolutely want to hear that conversation.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   But we was going to discuss this last week.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   The NASCAR page.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   The NASCAR now basically owns the hashtag.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   I wondered about that online.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.640]   And people said, "No, not as long as everything makes it through."
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   But then I saw some reference to the security page.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   So this is, if I say NASCAR is awful for making near death into a spectator sport.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   That ain't going to happen.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   And that doesn't end up on that page.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:28.080]   Then have they now restricted, have they now turned hashtags the platform of the people into
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   something that a brand can buy and control?
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.080]   That's a question.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   I don't know the answer.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   That's what I'm asking.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   Boy, is this--
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   Is this search results for hashtag NASCAR?
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   Yes.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   Yes.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   And it's brand-- so if you search #Nascar, you get this branded--
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   You get this.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   You get a branded page.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   It is a very branded page.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   Yep.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   Not a search result anymore.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   By the way, you can also go directly by Twitter.com and #Nascar instead of @Nascar, #Nascar.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.080]   I have a serious problem with this if it is pure.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   If your tweet got pulled out of that, then yeah, I think that's--
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   Let me tweet something--
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   That's what I'm just doing too, right?
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   Oh, we're doing this-- I've fented.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   We are live.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   We are slamming NASCAR live.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   Not that we'd really slam them.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   We're just curious what'll happen.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   I have to say, in every case, these are-- Lovedale Jr.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   Love Danica.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   In fact, Danica is tweeting.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   Love-- Jeff Gordon's tweeting.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   Darryl Waltripps tweeting.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   These are curated.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   This is clearly curated.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   Because it goes back--
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   I can't--
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   Because I could guarantee--
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   Well, no, you don't even have to.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   I'll tell you this right now.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   It starts--
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.080]   It goes back to the 17th of June in like four clicks.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.080]   Okay.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   You guys, I don't like this at all because the hashtag is what enables things like Occupy Wall Street to exist.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   And if you're watching it to exist.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   And if someone can buy that and then control it, so you get to the point of, you know,
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   Romney hashtag.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   Right.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   And what if I want to say critical things to Romney, it's not going to show up on a search for Romney?
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   And you can pay for that point.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   I wonder-- I should--
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   Yeah, it looks like there's a button to click to view search--
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   the actual search results.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   Not the sponsor page.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   Oh, view search results.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   I see it.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   You're right.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   Right there next to tweets.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   There's view search results.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.080]   And then is it different?
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   Let's see.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   Then you get top, and then you have to pay all again.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   So it's two clicks.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   Then it gets top, right?
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   And then you click click click click click.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   Yeah, now there-- I see Kevin's tweet.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   So wait, so let's break this down.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   You type NASCAR into the search box, and you don't get search results.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.080]   You get NASCAR's sponsor page, which then says view all search results.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   So you click on that, and then you get top tweets, which are very popular.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   No.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   If you search for NASCAR, you get the NASCAR search results.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:51.080]   If you click hashtag NASCAR, you get the-- oh, now it's giving me the search results.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:56.080]   If I-- when I went to Google and search-- nope.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   When I do hashtag NASCAR in the search, I get the NASCAR page.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   I don't.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   Maybe I've indicated that something.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   You know what?
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   I clicked the thing that says show search.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   I apparently have switched something off.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   Yeah, because when I did it the first time, I went to the sponsor page, and now that I've
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.080]   done it again, I went straight to the search results.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.080]   And I had clicked view search results, so maybe you turn it off.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   That's a whole different UI issue.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   Yeah, that's a whole different UI issue.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.080]   Yeah, that's a different UI issue.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   But telling someone-- they're searching for a word and sending them to a sponsored page
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   is a very strange UI decision.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.080]   That is controlled.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.080]   I mean, even if they were just sponsored, when I first asked the question, if they just had
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   an ad on that page, I wouldn't object.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   Right?
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   You're interested in NASCAR.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   Here's an ask car ad.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   We want to get a message across to you.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.080]   You know, go watch people try to kill themselves.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   Okay.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   But the fact that they have control over what we say about that topic, hmm.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   This is really interesting.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   Now, if I go to twitter.com/tag-twit, not @twit, but #twit, it takes me to the Twit canonical
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   page, which is not, by the way, authorized.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.080]   I mean, it is our page, but it's not like officially approved.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   But if I search for Twit, then I get a search result.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   So I guess they've changed what twitter.com #means.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   And if I do #owws, yeah, I get a page as a WS.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   So they're muddling it.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   There.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   It's not clear what you're going to get.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.320]   I've talked on this show in the past about, and I don't go quite this far, but the sanctity
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   of search.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.080]   When people search, this is what they expect to get.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   And so I thought there'd be more of a hubbub and I thought, well, not wrong.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.080]   People on Twitter just said, no, no, not the company, but just users.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   Said, no, no, no, it's just an animal.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.680]   I think what it's doing is reflecting Twitter culture.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:04.080]   All of these changes are now reflecting how people are using Twitter, which is as a brand,
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.360]   as you know, as it's a stream.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.600]   It's not about us users.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.240]   It's about the brands and, you know, Twitter is saying that you're saying.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.960]   Yeah, but I think the reason there's done it up was because people go, yeah, that's what
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.640]   Twitter is.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   A place to follow brands.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.480]   I was going to say, this sounds more like how Twitter wants people to use Twitter.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   I don't.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   That's not why I use Twitter.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   I mean, yes, I don't want to.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.480]   You'd be here in Old Far.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   That's two weeks ago.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   Oh, well, I don't want to.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.720]   People saying at the web was this is how they conceive of Twitter now.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.200]   They conceive of it as this place where you follow people who don't follow you back.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   You follow famous people.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.640]   You follow famous things.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   Exactly.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.680]   They ask you to search for NASCAR and Lady Gaga and football and whatever the hell else
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.680]   as part of the sign up process that they, before they even ask you to connect to your
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680]   friends.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.880]   So they want you to understand it in that mode before that you understand it as a communication
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.720]   to talk to your friends.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.000]   That's, that's, that's, I mean, listen, nice people Twitter, but that's not a platform
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.600]   for the people.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.640]   That's not a platform that enables revolutions.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.080]   No, that's, that's a wholly different thing.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.120]   Now tie it to the previous functionality you mentioned, right?
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.840]   So now you're Lady Gaga.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.440]   Now on your page, not the search for you, but the, but the user page.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.000]   Now you can get rid of all that riff-raff conversation and just give your message out.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.160]   Your NASCAR, your Nestle.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   Thank God.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.560]   You'll get your advertising message out.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.040]   Who trained manifesto folks?
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.800]   We sent them a few copies.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.240]   Markets are conversations.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.640]   They're not messages.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.680]   So anyway, thank you.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.720]   And by the way, now that Twitter is doing a hell on before Facebook and everybody and
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.160]   all the other social networks start doing it because it is a, it is a business model.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.120]   It's a good business model.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.760]   Yeah, it is.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.960]   Twitter going IPO any day now.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   What's the challenge?
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.960]   Facebook has done.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.200]   Facebook had a distinction between personal pages and what are they?
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.560]   They call them brand pages, right?
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   So you end up with two.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   Right.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:14.240]   And then they've recently blurred that a bit by letting people follow you on your personal
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.920]   page as well.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.560]   So you can follow people without them having to friend you.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.800]   So they're converging a bit more.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.200]   And I think they learned a lot from Twitter where Twitter didn't make this thing, you
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   have to be a person.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.840]   You have to be an entity or a joke and you can still create this thing that's there.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.160]   And I think Twitter is now.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.840]   Well, not a genius point.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.280]   So, Jeannie, you were going to carry the conversations and I want to mention that after
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.160]   you do that, there's a new service from an MP in the UK that's trying to do the same
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.160]   thing.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   So why don't you do first?
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   Yes.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   This is good.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.160]   Yeah, that we were going to talk about.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.160]   What is it?
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   Blaze?
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.160]   It's branch.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   So beta.branch.com.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.760]   And it's actually, it's invite only right now, but one of the ones I was involved in actually
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.040]   got to the front page of all things D. So if you go to allthingsd.com under mustreads,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.120]   there's a link that says owning your own words.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.840]   Is it important?
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.480]   That's a link to a branch conversation.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.480]   Interesting.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.120]   Is this an all things D?
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   What?
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.280]   Yeah, go on to mustreads and then I'm confused.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.920]   That red label right down there on the left.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   Okay.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   Is owning your words important?
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   Owning your words.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.240]   So that's a link to a branch conversation.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.560]   This is not an article on all things D.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.480]   This is just a link.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:33.640]   So branch is the food camp of Twitter conversations.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.920]   You actually get invited.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.760]   So somebody starts a conversation and then invites a couple of people to participate.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.440]   And they can respond and then they can invite other people.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.900]   So Josh Miller started this conversation and invited a meal who invited me and MGC
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.840]   Glure and Paul Ford and a few people.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.200]   Oh, this is a very clever way to spread a beta.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.320]   Yeah, it really is.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.000]   So only the people who are invited to the conversation or the people they've invited
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   can post.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And it's.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.160]   And Gina does the so the person who starts the branch is the one who has control over
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   it.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   Exactly.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.280]   The person who starts the branch is doing Nick Denton is doing where in any comment thread
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   post there, right?
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.480]   When you start a comment, you control the rest of the thread based on your comment.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   So this is a yeah.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.160]   So the idea is to make a really high quality conversation with you.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   The people you want.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.800]   It's kind of Quora ish.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:34.240]   It's you know, you know, is the group blogs we used to use back in 2001 when we were talking
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.560]   about Blue train where this was we just used Blogger and gave six people contribution rights
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.640]   and then you would write post to each other.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   Yes.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.280]   So for me, it's like a trip back in time, 10 years with that was the tool we had.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.720]   And it's, you know, it is one that the reason we did it then was that, you know, that was
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.480]   before we built a right, there wasn't a notification mechanism.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.440]   So you have to think about the same place to check it.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.680]   And the second reason was then you can control who can respond to it.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.360]   But it was also because at that time, folks didn't have comments by default.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.000]   That was as if they were independent mechanisms.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.960]   Gina, what do you think about this?
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   The fact is cool.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   It's cool.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.720]   It's cool, but it's also a closed room.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.880]   It says the conversation is concluded.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   Nobody else can comment.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.200]   Yeah, you get rid of the riffraff, but you also talk about that.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   I mean, I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   I think it's a great conversation.

[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   I think it's a great conversation.

[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   I think it's a great conversation.

[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   I think it's a great conversation.

[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   I think it's a great conversation.

[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   I think it's a great conversation.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.200]   You control it, but it does feel more democratic, I have to say.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   This is interesting that it made it to must read and all things D.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   Yeah, I was surprised by that.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   I mean, I guess that's their kind of links link.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Right.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   It's from other websites, but it's cool.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   All right.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   Come back with more.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   What a great panel we have here.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.200]   Kevin Marks from, from Fairy Plaza in San Francisco.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   Everyone's one of the bells ring.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   And of course, Gina Trippani from smarterware.org.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   And you can find Kevin on the Tumblevision.tv.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.200]   That's his weekly podcast about tumbling.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about GoToMyPC, the best remote access tool out there.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   It connects your Mac or PC at the office to the world so that you can go to work wherever you are,
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   not just from your Mac or PC, from your iPad, from your iPhone.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.200]   They've got free apps for both.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.200]   Android 2, that is so cool.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.200]   That is so cool.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   So here's the deal.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   You could try this right now.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   If you visit GoToMyPC.com, click the Try It Free button and use our offer code Twig.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   30 days unlimited use free.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   Now do that from your desktop because you're going to want to install this on your desktop.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.200]   It could be a, it doesn't, I say office because that's how most people use it.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   It could be your home computer.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   Whatever computer you want to be accessible anytime, anywhere.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.200]   Securely too, by the way.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.200]   It's 128-bit SSL.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   It's password protected.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   They use NAT traversal.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.200]   So that means you don't have to punch a hole in your router and open any security holes.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   It's really, to my knowledge, has never been a security ever been a security exploit with GoToMyPC.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   It's the remote access to use, absolutely secure and fast because Citrix knows remote access.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   They're the guys or gals or people.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   Visit it right now.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Go to myPC.com on your Mac or your PC.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   Install it.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   Take a second or two to install and then hit the road with your iPhone or your iPad or your
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   Android tablet and start, and start getting your work done.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   Send and receive email.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   Run any program.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   Access any network resource.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.200]   Just like you're there.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   It's kind of wild to run, say, Windows on an Android tablet.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   It's just a weird feeling, but it works.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   So you get mouse gestures, mouse control, full keyboard, all of it.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.200]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.200]   Try it today.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   Use the offer code twig.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   Were you going to write me a check?
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.200]   Go ahead and do that.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   I saw you were doing a check there.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   Just make it out to cache.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.200]   So there's mention.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   There's -- see, I have to admit, I want to invite.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   To branch?
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   Anything.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   Joe, now that you've been invited into a conversation, do you have the power to start a conversation?
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.200]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   I'm telling you, do not invite scoble.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   By the way, I wanted to mention Kevin is -- one of the other reasons Kevin marks us here is this is the seventh anniversary of microformats.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   Woo hoo!
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   It is.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   Yes.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   Woo hoo!
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   What are microformats?
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   Microformats are ways of adding extra meaning to your HTML so that they can make more sense for computers as well as for humans.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.200]   Things like --
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.200]   And it's --
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   XFN.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:33.200]   XFN is the intersectional friends network that lets you link to other people and say whether they are friends or followers or whether they are you.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   Rheticals me is a really important one.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   This site is also me.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   It's also things like H-card which lets you create a business card on the page that can be pulled out against straightforwardly.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   And the series of other models like that for embedding structured meaning in the page.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   What's different about it is that there are several alternative versions of this that embed an entirely parallel set of data in the page.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:08.200]   If you look at Facebook's OGP, it gives you a bunch of stuff at the top of the page that is independent of what the content is.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   A part of the point of microformats is that it's using the actual text of the page.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   There's plenty of extra hints to the computers reading it so that it's at which pieces went.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.200]   And it's open.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   And not --
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   It's open?
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   Our standard organization is a wiki.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   That's how open it is.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   And by the way, I had really high hopes that this would become the social network because basically your everybody's page becomes part of a larger social network.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   And it was the right way to do it.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   But unfortunately --
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   It's still there.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   I mean, the X event stuff is still there.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   WordPress publishes it.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   Blollab publishes it.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   Twitter used to publish it.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.200]   I haven't actually looked since their last redesign.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   I didn't double-check that.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   Facebook publishes it, but they made it harder to crawl because they don't serve pages to you unless you stay your browser.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.200]   Google+ profiles still publish X events.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.200]   So a bunch of this stuff did exist on the web.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:13.200]   But what we've seen is sites instead of building closed social networks, rather than horrible ones, which has been tricky.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   Well, there's still a party tonight, 6.30 at Mozilla in San Francisco.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   Is it open?
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   Do you have to get an invitation to it?
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.200]   Yeah, this invitation.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.200]   Oh, I see.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   You invited me.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   I'm pretty sure it's public.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   All right.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.200]   Well, I have been invited and I invite you.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   It's just like France.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   You know, this is the principle. This is a standard sport.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   It has a radical openness principle that says anyone who understands it and will defend it as a wiki would.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   Yes, and I defend it.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   I think it's great.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   And I don't think it's at all weird that you use Facebook to invite people to your party.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.200]   I do that too.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   We also have a page on the side and we have a blank ask link.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   We used to use upcoming when that existed.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   Does it exist?
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.200]   I've actually looked to that page for a few years.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   Kevin is having a party already at Ferry Plaza apparently.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   LinkedIn is being sued by an Illinois woman that's just in over the password breach.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:29.200]   She's suing them for $5 million, brought in federal court in San Jose.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   It seeks class action status.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:38.200]   So this would be a bad precedent if every site that had a breach of passwords got sued.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.200]   The whole internet will collapse.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   Is there any reference to actual damages in this?
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   Yeah, that's why you don't really have a Katie Zaprika user of the website from Illinois used
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   a Illinois based law firm Edelson McGuire.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   She said LinkedIn had deceived customers by having a security policy and clear contradiction of accepted
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   industry standards for database security.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   LinkedIn says the lawsuit is without merit that no member count has been breached as a result
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   of the incident and there's no reason to believe that any LinkedIn member has been injured.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:16.200]   In other words, you got to show you are harmed.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   If nothing happened, sorry.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.200]   Well, we'll see.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.200]   This sounds like one of those cases.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   I wonder if we're going to get to a point two where sites say as part of their TOS, you may not
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   use a password you use for another site and if you do, it's your own damn phone.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   Because that would be one source of harm, wouldn't it?
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.200]   Oh, I just gave lawyers an idea.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   That's all right.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.200]   They have plenty of them.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.200]   Plenty of them.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.200]   That's a good news.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.200]   Google offers is now available on the iPhone.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   This is something they added.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.200]   Did they add it to a map?
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.200]   Or is it?
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.200]   Oh, no, it's a standalone app.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.200]   Stand on the app.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   I just downloaded it for a show.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   I'm going to download this.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.200]   So this is their group on Google offers for the iPhone.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   Is it an office?
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   No, Google offers for the iPhone.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   Now that's what we need.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   It's an office for the iPhone.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   This is like a group on.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   You get coupons off and all of that.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   Which is an old model, I think.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:13.200]   It does feel dated.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   Now, when SNH Green Stamps does an app, then I'm going to get it.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   You remember those layout?
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.200]   Did you have to look those two?
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   Mom would make these.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.200]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, test here, Gina.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   Do you know what an SNH Green Stamp is?
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   No idea.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.200]   What?
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.200]   No idea.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   SNH Green Stamps?
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   What do you think it is?
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   Do you know what do you think that stands for?
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   Chat room, what are you going to read?
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   Where's that blue?
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   Where's that blue?
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.200]   Some other stamp.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   There was gold.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.200]   Gold is it and gold.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   Gold stamps.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.200]   Gold.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   Yeah, that was the worst stuff.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.200]   I don't know.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:57.200]   Is it like a Willy Wonka chocolate bar?
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:02.200]   You probably don't remember the days when gas stations would give you plates for filling
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   up either.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.200]   Plates?
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   Like eating plates.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   I've suddenly entered some like...
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   Like my entire reference reality is off.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   What?
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.200]   No, it's kind of weird.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   You pull up in the gas station, a guy had come up to you in a nice white suit with a little
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   hat and say, "Fill her up today, sir.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.200]   Can I check your oil?
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:26.200]   You pop the hoodie, check the oil, it fills you up and then it gives you a plate."
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.200]   Okay.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.200]   Really?
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.200]   Am I making this up, Jeff?
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   Am I making this?
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   This was premium marketing and actually there's a magnificent, wonderful book about the history
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:43.200]   of the great A&P, which was really the first chain store and now we live in the era of
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:48.200]   chain stores dying and the way they compete with each other was not necessarily on price
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:55.200]   because the law, little tiny mom and pop grocery stores banded together to fight the chain
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.200]   stores as if they were evil.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   Gee, it's just like today people against Google.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   Nothing changes.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.200]   Nothing ever changes.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.200]   And so, anyway, so they would use try to get government regulation to stop it.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   So the government regulation against consumers' interest would freeze prices.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   Hi, I wouldn't lie to more prices.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   So what they would do is they would instead give you these stamps.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   You put these stamps in these books, poor Leo and I would have to like these stamps.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   You have to like them.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   Then your mother would take in ten of these books and you know, get a beach ball or something.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   Yeah, crap.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   Now Kevin Creewell in the chat room is reminding me that grocery stores used to sell encyclopedias
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   one letter a month.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   So you get the funky, it was funky waggles and you'd get the encyclopedia.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   Was it funky?
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.200]   It was just me street.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   This month is brought to you by L, yeah.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.200]   Wow.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.200]   And in the negative, get ready for this.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.200]   Microsoft bought that encyclopedia and it was the foundation for Encarta.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   Oh, Encarta.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   Who remembers Encarta?
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.200]   I remember that.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.200]   It was a collier.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   It was a collier.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.200]   Premium marketing.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:03.200]   So actually one of the great moments of premium marketing was sports illustrated coming up with the sneaker phone.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.200]   It was a phone in a sneaker.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.200]   And the problem was that people started, they wanted the phone.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.200]   They didn't want the damn magazine.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.200]   And so they subscribed just long enough to get the damn phone and then they'd cancel a magazine.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.200]   And their warehouses filled with sneaker phones.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:23.200]   And so Time Make found itself in the sneaker phone business.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.200]   I always wanted a football phone from ESPN, but that's another story for another.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.200]   How the heck did we get on the S&H games?
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   How do we get an S&H stamps?
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.200]   Blue chip stamps.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200]   Blue chip stamps.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.200]   Thank you.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.200]   Web 3378 the chat room.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.200]   Blue chip stamps, S&H green stamps and gold bond stamps.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.200]   It came up with a, yeah, the Google, Google.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   That's right.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   It's also Randy P.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.200]   Drinking glasses and laundry detergent.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.200]   Yes.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.200]   Well, it's like Cracker Jacks.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.200]   Gina, you do know Cracker Jacks.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.200]   I do know Cracker Jacks.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   I know about Cracker Jacks.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   Let me tell you young lady, the toys today are nothing like the toys.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200]   Nothing.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.200]   Oh, you used to get actual toys.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.200]   We used to get cell phones in our Cracker Jacks.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.200]   Now you get like a piece of paper that says this is a toy.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.200]   Right.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   Like here's a joke on a piece of paper.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.200]   There's your toy.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   I got your surprise.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   I got your surprise right here.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.200]   Next time I fill up, I'm going to describe it when the guy in the white hat doesn't show
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200]   up with a plate.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.200]   I still get the plate thing.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   I don't get the plate thing.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200]   Well, because it was incentive.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.200]   You go to the, because this was in the days, I guess when there was profit in selling gasoline.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.200]   I mean, incentive to stock up your kitchen cabin.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   I don't understand.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   You'd end up with a whole set of plates.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.200]   You'd end up with the SNO plates.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.200]   Were they going to have some more plates?
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   No, they were just plates.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.200]   It was a sec.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.200]   This month we're giving away the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.200]   you had to keep going.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.200]   It was a loyalty program.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.200]   Right.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.200]   One plate.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   What's the big deal?
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200]   But if you want to get the whole thing, you got to come every.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.200]   There's a pop stars episode about this.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.200]   Oh, I'm sure there is.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   There's got to be.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:03.200]   This is why, this is why Jeff and I feel so disoriented in the modern world.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   We, this is, I mean, this is just beginning.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   Gina, you're going to see this in 20, 30 years.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   I don't know.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   50 years.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.200]   You're going to see this because what's, what's happening is it's accelerating.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   So the disorientation that Jeff and I feel is minor compared to what you're going to feel like when you're our age.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   You're going to say, I remember when there was a Google and they'll go, come on.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.200]   What?
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.200]   What?
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   It's called stores.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   You used to go to get things.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.200]   Remember those flip phones?
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.200]   You press numbers on.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.200]   Yes.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   You remember that.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   I remember when it was a phone.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.200]   I mean, it's hard to imagine even what will, what it will be like.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.200]   It's true.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.200]   Google says 12.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.200]   I don't know.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.200]   Is this a number I should check first?
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.200]   No, but I'm glad you're bringing us back to home.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:54.200]   Google says 12 to 14 million searches per day returned hacked sites.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:00.200]   But 12 to 14 million searches searches relative to what?
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   I mean, how many searches are there for today?
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   I think what they're doing is writing it 12 to 14 million times a day.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   They, they, they protect you by warning you.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   Right.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.200]   By the way, our site is as, as in the past from time to time, been that, but this is year to year.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.200]   Uh, in fact, the sites discovered monthly.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:20.200]   It actually peaked in 2009 and it's been going somewhat down since then.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.200]   A tax sites discovered monthly on the other hand is going up.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.200]   So infected sites versus attack sites.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   The tax sites are sites specifically built distribute malware.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.200]   More of those discovered legitimate sites compromised.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   Apparently people are getting smarter about locking their sites down.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:47.200]   Yeah, that's, you know, because I think isn't this the anniversary of when Google started?
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:53.200]   Uh, it was how many years ago, like city, it's been a while that Google started warning people about infected sites.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.200]   I think so.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.200]   Five years.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.200]   Five years.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   Five years since we officially announced malware and phishing protection, VR safe, safe browsing efforts.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   Thank you, Google.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   Now everybody does it, but thank you, Google.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   You started it.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.200]   Venice Beach body builders feel fear Google is kicking sand at them.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   This is just a funny quote.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   Uh, Google is buying a whole bunch of Venice stuff and that's where Schwarzenegger, you know, built his body.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.200]   And it's filled with all these jim.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.200]   And there's a great quote.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.200]   They're not going to find it.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   Um, Google movie, an army of sales and technology employees into a hundred thousand square feet in two Venice buildings.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.200]   I love Venice.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:40.200]   It's kind of down market, but if you ever want to get a marijuana, a club card, 20 bucks.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   Just in case you were curious.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200]   I want to lay out.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   Can you do a show?
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   Hi?
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   No.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.200]   I used to, you know, when I was a younger, much younger, younger than Gina even man.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:58.200]   I think I, one time I might have done a radio show somewhat out of it.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.200]   Oh, calling the FCC.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.200]   So the quote.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:16.200]   The fan, you'll moon bulge with muscles called this quote, the ultimate revenge of the nerds, the greatest way of getting back and all the guys that stuffed people from Google into lockers from high school and stole all their prom day.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200]   I'll show you.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   You were going to buy you Jim.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   And you can't fight against Google because they've got billions of dollars.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.200]   But he added, I love their search engine.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:31.200]   Google, Google is not the only culprit here.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   The old world gym at the top of Abbott Kenny, the place that was Arnold Schwarzenegger's gym has also been sold and is no longer a gym.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   It's a high end shops and offices.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.200]   And guess who bought it?
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   And we'll be a future tenant.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.200]   Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   Take that.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.200]   I'm going to buy you.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   And then I will shred you.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:01.200]   Google is responding to the new British investigation of Street View.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   I know that.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.200]   I don't chat.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   Just put that in there just to get to me.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.200]   Just for you.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.200]   When is Google going to say this was all stuff that was just, I mean, we don't like it.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.200]   It was stupid.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.200]   It was wrong.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.200]   We asked publicly on the airwaves.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.200]   What's illegal about it?
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:24.200]   Google says we're surprised to find ourselves confronting yet another investigation.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   And then the next story is that now we have US government officials going after Google and Apple because they're freaked that they're both flying planes with cameras over us.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200]   I was a little freaked.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.200]   Don't you know?
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   It's not so much I'm worried about the pictures.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.200]   Swarming pins above our locations.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.200]   Actually, I don't think it's like that.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   I think it's probably the same point as same contractors working for both probably, right?
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   They're probably doing these for government.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:01.200]   I was at MIT Media Lab night thing in the last two days.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:09.200]   And a lot of talk about journalistic use of camera drones to cover things like demonstrations.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   And there were examples of, oh, you put a camera into a drone and you can fly over a demonstration to get to stuff that you, you know, beyond the police barricades.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   Right.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.200]   There was one example of it being that was.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:36.200]   Or helicopters or balloons, or I think there was one story that I saw this on Twitter when I was out of the room. But somebody did it to try to get hunters and the hunter shot it down.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.200]   You know, it's probably a good idea not to fly planes over people with weapons.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.200]   Just a hint.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   At least not if they don't like you.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.200]   Now, Facebook has acquired face.com.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:53.200]   So they're going to get even better facial recognition built into Facebook.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.200]   Apparently Facebook can do it pretty well on desktop at the mobiles.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.200]   Not so good.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.200]   Face.com's got a good mobile app.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:09.200]   According to Mike Isaac on all things D, the deal was about much less than it was originally reported.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.200]   But somewhere in the 50 to 60 million dollar range.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.200]   Face.com's very happy.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.200]   I mean, do we, I mean, I don't have any problem with face recognition.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:34.200]   Now, if you, if you do, if you use Apple to the iPhone to turn on face, no, I guess the aperture or iPhone to turn on face recognition.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.200]   It just, it goes right up to Facebook ads.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   It's to the Facebook.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   We're all working together now.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200]   It's okay.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   We all know who you are.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   Facebook says we are going to sell ads based on your web browsing.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   A new Facebook system will use your activity on other websites.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   Must be the like button, right?
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   To send you to send you what Facebook thinks are more than like button.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.200]   If you were near a purchase opportunity, you'll remember that.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.200]   This has been done for quite some time.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:08.200]   Now, Facebook's adding a duplicate because they can tear off the feature on because they're loading our frame with the like button in it.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   Right.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.200]   So, like button sees where you're going.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   But here's, here's the example from Doug Gross writing on CNN.com.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:23.200]   Say a Facebook user visits a travel website, clicks on a page about a vacation package to Vegas.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:30.200]   If an advertiser has a bid on that kind of search, that user could then see ads for discounted trips to Vegas.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:37.200]   The next time they visit Facebook, so, but, but I guess, but how is Facebook getting that information?
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.200]   So, in other words, Facebook's saying to its advertisers.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.200]   This is not, this is not new.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:51.200]   There was a company called Dakota started by a friend of mine that was bought by AOL and then ruined and shut down where the deal was, the New York Times did this.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.200]   You went to the New York Times, you went to a travel page about Vegas.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.200]   You left and you went to weather.com and checked the weather there, but New York Times still had another travel ad they wanted to give you.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   They couldn't.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:15.200]   And, and this is that, um, weather.com would get 40% of the ad for delivering the media, delivering you New York Times.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   We've got 20% of the deal for delivering the data point about you and Dakota would get 20% of the deal for making income.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.200]   Yeah, so it's not a third party cookie.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   It's not a Facebook cookie.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   It's the site you went to saying, quick, buying out on Facebook in case they go back there.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200]   I mean, I think kind of.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.200]   Yeah, I mean, everything is a third party.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.200]   You're like, well, that this is not a, this is not a new model.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:44.200]   I'm sure we'll hear horrors and hubbubs coming up very soon, but it's a model that's been in for a decade.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.200]   But the, but both the sites have to have this code embedded on them somehow.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:55.200]   I think I just assumed it was the like button that was sending information back like, oh, this IP visited here.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.200]   Right.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.200]   Right.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:08.200]   If you're the site that created the data point because of the interest point, right, right, you get a share of that, of that deal in the Facebook model.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.200]   I'm not sure you do, but you have willily put the like button up on your site.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.200]   So I'm sure somewhere you sign something saying that'll be okay.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.200]   Right.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.200]   Right.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   So you're saying no big deal.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.200]   So P.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.200]   Well, there will be a reaction the reaction will be.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.200]   Right.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.200]   Right.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.200]   And it's just, it's just to give you.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.200]   So what's different is that Facebook is now selling these ads offering these ads to people.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   Facebook's doing it on what they've added to it is that it's a live editing structure.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   Right.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.200]   So if you really want to get somebody, you can bid against someone else.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   So it brings that Google view of the auction into this and say, hey, we just found somebody who wants to go to Vegas.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200]   Who wants them?
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:58.200]   What are they worth the, uh, or, or like if you're Zappos and somebody has gone to the checkout page, but canceled.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.200]   Right.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.200]   Now you see the show this person's apple sads when they're on Facebook to remind them.
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:12.200]   Or somebody else, somebody else can come in and say, if, if a, a, a frustrated Zappos buyer comes in, send them to me.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.200]   Right.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   Shoes.com or whatever.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.200]   Right.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.200]   You can't apparently.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.200]   You can't apparently turn this off.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   Good luck finding this.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   I just.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   There's something that allows you to write this.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.200]   So if you go to a certain site, do something that goes, we'll show you.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.200]   I don't have the place that will open the rest of the web.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.200]   This is called this is tracking cookie.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.200]   Right.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   And I, so I went to a private Facebook privacy settings ads apps and websites.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.200]   Hmm.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:51.200]   It keeps it's, I look through it.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.200]   I don't see it.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:59.200]   I'm looking at this article again, which supposedly tells us how, but I, it's, anyway, we leave this as an exercise for the reader.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.200]   It's literally seven clicks and ads shown by third parties.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.200]   Well, while you're in there, turn everything off.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.200]   Turn it all off.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   You know, no, not on the, if you're, if you're Jeff, don't know.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   Yeah, Jeff, you leave it on.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   And I've been seeing complaints lately, right?
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:27.200]   I've seen this up like three or four times as we come up with kind of the meme where people do screenshots of the ads that Facebook has for them and mocks them for being so untargeted.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   Right.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.200]   Right.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.200]   Right.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.200]   Right.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.200]   The more information that you share.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.200]   In fact, we more often mock Facebook for the crappy ads than we do for the, the right audience.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.200]   So by the way, I just went to Facebook and what is it?
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.200]   What is it giving me?
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.200]   It's giving me the galaxy S3.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   It's smart of you.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.200]   Facebook.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.200]   Good.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.200]   Me too.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.200]   I'm getting that same ad as well.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.200]   Really?
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.200]   I wonder what I'm getting.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.200]   They're listening to us.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.200]   So there's a question.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.200]   Do they know that I have a galaxy S3 already and are they going to advertise something else?
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.200]   Yes, they are.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   They're advertising HP something.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.200]   That's not clear.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.200]   Right code for MATLAB play Marvel game.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:12.200]   A kiss and motley crew concert coming up on the 15th at Shoreline.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.200]   Diesel performance parts for my Ford.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   Okay.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.200]   That's the first one that's actually fit anything.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   Facebook combat game and Barrett Jackson car auction from Orange County.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.200]   They think I'm into cars.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   I liked Ford.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.920]   That's why I put, I did the like button on the Ford page.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.000]   That's why.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   This is the longest day of the year, but not the longest show of the year.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.400]   We're going to take a break and come back and we will get our tool tip and pick.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.360]   Google play little tip is slashing prices on apps, music and books for the longest day
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.360]   of the year.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:55.040]   Sales, summer, solstice, go check your Google play to see if you could find some 99 set apps
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040]   there.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.520]   Beat reads at about 99 and many famous albums are marked at two 99 a title.
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.320]   Draw something is discounted.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   You know what?
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.920]   You'll be heavily discounted soon.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.560]   Rihanna's loud Rolling Stones Brussels affair.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560]   Okay.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.560]   Okay.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.680]   Meanwhile, have you backed up lately?
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:21.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to tell you about carbonite.com back up done.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.440]   Right.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   Carbon.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.320]   I, my friend, David friend who's a CEO there, founder of it.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.680]   I'm serial entrepreneur.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.840]   He was the guy who started ARP synthesizers at a college.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   He had retired.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.080]   He was a joint life and then his college age daughter called him tears to daddy.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.680]   I just, I just lost my thesis and I don't, it's gone.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680]   What do I do?
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.440]   And he said, yeah, there's a kind of be a better way to back up.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.360]   And he came up with carbonite now to bring it full circle.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.600]   When I sent my daughter to college freshman year, what did I put on her laptop?
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.000]   Carbonite so that she would not call me crying about her thesis.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.120]   Now she cries about boys and other appropriate things.
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:02.600]   All right, is a backup plan for your home, home office or small business.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.240]   I'll tell you what, you got to try it.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.600]   It starts at $59 a year, less than five bucks a month for that laptop.

[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:18.420]   of the, you know, the campus store, no problem because it's 128 bit SSL.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:22.200]   If you really want privacy, you can use your own strong encryption and nobody, not even
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.400]   carbonite knows the password just you.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.920]   They also, they also have apps for the iPhone, the Android phone, tablets too, that let you
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.520]   see your data.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:36.080]   So even if a disaster doesn't happen, it's cloud storage too.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.640]   I mean, this is a really great service.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.000]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.040]   Carbonite.com, $59 is the starting point, but it's free for the first two weeks when

[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.120]   So you can upload your own background image essentially when you're in Gmail, if you go
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.480]   to settings and then themes.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.200]   Look, doing it right now.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.000]   Oh, there's a section that says custom themes.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.960]   And you choose, it's pretty simply, you choose lighter dark and then you can set a background
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.960]   image.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:35.280]   And they've got a bunch of background images that you can use that they're already there.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.280]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:42.760]   Or you can upload one of your own photos or, you know, add a Google+ URL.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]   It's nice.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.360]   I mean, you know, someone made a comment about how MySpace failed because people made it
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360]   look so ugly.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.240]   Yeah, but only you have to see this.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.640]   Only you have to see this.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   And I think it's nice.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.160]   I think there's just one photo of a baby.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.000]   This is a nice kind of, have a picture of your family or something in your email to
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   remind you to get out of your inbox and go spend time with them.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   Yeah, really.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   Or just pretty pretty pretty people.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.520]   Do you remember these people?
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520]   They remember you.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.520]   They remember you.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.760]   And they're wondering where the hell have you been?
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.360]   I love it that it takes my Google+ photos.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.800]   Actually, Picasso photos as well.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.400]   So I could, here, I'll just put this junked up computer lab in the background.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.960]   And did it do it?
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:26.960]   Is it still doing it?
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:27.960]   It's loading it.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.960]   There it is.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.560]   Now I have garbage in the background.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.760]   Electronic garbage.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.760]   That's kind of cool.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.240]   More clutter than your inbox.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.680]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.960]   I like it.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   And a plug.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:42.960]   Shameless plug.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:48.240]   Kevin Purdy, who's been a guest here on Twig a few times, and I are doing a new tech podcast.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240]   It's called In Beta.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.080]   Check it out, 5x5.tv/in beta.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.080]   It just started.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.600]   Oh, no, you've got three of them now.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.600]   You've been cranking them out.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.200]   Yeah, we're three episodes in.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.840]   So we're just starting to get our groove.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.600]   Free bacon and tight T-shirts.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.600]   Yeah, we were talking about conferences there.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.120]   There's no video like Twit.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.120]   That's just audio.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.120]   Thank God.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.120]   Something.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120]   Thank God.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.360]   Benjamin, he really frosts my mug.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.840]   No, actually, Andy, he doesn't actually.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.840]   I love Dan.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840]   And he's doing a great job.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.200]   And Andy Inako is also on there with Andy Inako's Almanac in beta.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.240]   So you talk about web and open source software.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   Open source web-based social and mobile apps.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.880]   Just basically, really, I kind of stole the idea from Jeff, this idea of beta culture
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.520]   or what happens when you put things out there that aren't complete and aren't finished
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:45.880]   and iterate quickly the way that we do these days instead of just issuing out completely
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880]   finished products.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.120]   Kind of the good part and the bad part.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:54.080]   And he's got something we should probably have done, which is he has an app that five
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:59.400]   by five radio app that lets-- for three bucks, so he gets a little money that way, which is
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.120]   good, always nice.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.040]   And then you have all the shows just kind of in there, including the schedule.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.440]   Do you-- now, I know some of his shows do-- he broadcasts the recording live.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.440]   Does he do that with you?
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440]   Yeah, he does.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.440]   We do live stream.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.160]   And actually, the app is for the live stream.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   So you can say, hey, no, it's fine.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.160]   He would invade a start.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.640]   So you get a push notification.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.160]   It's an iOS app.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.160]   And yeah, we do do it.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.000]   Although it's a lot more DIY than Twit.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   Twit's great.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.280]   You guys all handle everything for us, but with five or five of them, kind of running the
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280]   broadcast myself.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.680]   It's all right.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.680]   That's good for you.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.680]   Yeah, it's been fun.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.480]   You do those Thursdays at one.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.480]   Tuesdays.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.880]   Tuesdays at one Eastern 10 AM.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.960]   So if it changes, though, so you check the schedule.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.960]   Good.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   We'll get the app.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.520]   My editor, Ben Loonen, wanted me to make the follow-up book to what Google do, a book
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.520]   called Beta.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520]   Ah.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.520]   Yeah, remember you scrapped that idea, right?
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.520]   Jeff, I was like that.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.520]   Yeah, I did.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520]   I first liked the idea.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520]   And then I actually should send you the Prezi on it.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.440]   I did a Prezi with kind of how it affects everything.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   I was saying that, yeah.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.440]   Of life.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.560]   And then, after I did the Prezi, I kind of thought, well, all right, I've thought this
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560]   all through.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560]   And then I sat down, tried to write it.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560]   And I said, ah.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.560]   You weren't feeling it.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.560]   I wasn't feeling it.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.560]   It's not what I did public parts.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.880]   I got no control of the trouble.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.400]   But I'm sure there's pressure to do book three soon.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.880]   I think maybe I could do it as a Kindle single.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.520]   Yeah, you did the Gutenberg.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.720]   By the way, that's a great Kindle single, 99 cents.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:21.720]   Thank you very much.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:25.160]   I'm going to do a post coming up on all the sales reports and results.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160]   Oh, I'd love to.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.680]   I'd love to see how that worked for you.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.320]   I'm sure a lot of other authors are paying attention.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.440]   Now our number of the week, 9.9 million.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:40.120]   That's how much Jack Dorsey spent for his new house.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.680]   I'm sure he did it with the square.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680]   And the pictures are pretty amazing.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.080]   And it's only two bedrooms, but it has a view.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.240]   He has a $10 million house.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.240]   It's two bedrooms.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.280]   But Jack, they say Jack, spend another million and have a third bedroom.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.360]   I hope it's got three baths.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.360]   It's phenomenal.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360]   It's beautiful.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   Oh, look at that.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.840]   The river is going to say the bridge is great.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.600]   So this is a little bit of real estate voyeurism.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.000]   I had no good numbers this week, so this rescue.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.680]   The Daily Mail says it's a hideout worthy of a James Bond villain.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.400]   This is where the money's going.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.400]   I'm jealous.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.400]   Look at that.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.400]   It's gorgeous.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   Where is that?
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.400]   Is that in Tiburon?
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.400]   No, no.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.400]   It's in San Francisco.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.400]   So it must get fogged in constantly.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.000]   If you go down, you see the view of the bridge he has.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.400]   Where in San Francisco could that be?
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.400]   There, Jay.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.400]   Oh.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.400]   No, it's nice.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.400]   Try not.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.800]   So I've got a number for you.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800]   All right.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.800]   My number is zero.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.240]   Gives us paying zero damages to Oracle.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.240]   That just came out.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240]   There it is.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:47.920]   That court case, which was of course Oracle suing Google for its use of Java without credit
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.320]   and use of particularly two routines.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:56.920]   They lost on trademark or copyright issues, and they apparently lost also on patent issues.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.040]   And well, actually it was a mixed bag on copyright issues.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:06.880]   But apparently the value of the award, zero dollars, zero dollars.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:11.600]   I think was, were damages paid to Google here or no?
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.600]   I guess not.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:15.000]   There were statutory damages.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.440]   Statutory damages.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440]   Okay.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.400]   Because the not my lines of code was, that was seen as copyright infringement.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   Right.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.040]   The judge is a damn true zero.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.040]   Zero.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.600]   Yeah, the judge was not pleased.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.880]   He said, look, I've written a range check.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.760]   I can write a range check in my sleep.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.440]   You can't copyright a range check.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.240]   That's my kind of judge.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240]   Love that guy.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   Love that guy.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.240]   Love that guy.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.240]   What are you talking about?
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.520]   I taught myself Java and I wrote a range check and there's nothing to it.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.360]   Nothing to it.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.320]   Everybody in this courtroom could do it.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.120]   Yeah, that was right.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.880]   That's Keith Love just sent to you from Gina, Japan.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880]   Less than three.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.600]   Less than three.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.720]   Also, do you want to do any of the other?
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.720]   You got three numbers, Jeff.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:02.720]   You got a ton of them.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.720]   Oh, they were crappy numbers.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.720]   Crappy numbers.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:06.720]   Let's not do them.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.720]   I like 9.9 million.
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:08.720]   That's a good number.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.720]   Yep.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.720]   It's a beautiful house, but you're right.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.600]   They took the pictures.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.200]   This is from the Sotheby's listing.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.600]   The house was actually, I got to say, Jack got a deal.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.320]   It was listed four years ago for twice as much.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:27.840]   And these pictures were obviously taken on the one sunny day.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.240]   I do hope Jack checked.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.480]   For those of you who aren't in San Francisco, when you go out that far, you've got the Sunset
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.320]   District, not that far, it is just pure fog.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.320]   Cat feet hell.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.680]   Well, you're actually outside the Golden Gate there, right?
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.720]   It's freezing cold and windy.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.720]   If you really.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.720]   Jack, invite me.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.720]   I'll go where I'll win.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.720]   The thing is that that fog has a weird edge to it.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.720]   So it may be that he's got a house in the bit that's actually sunny.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.720]   Right.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.720]   That fog is stable.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.720]   It's just in place every day.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.720]   There's this really bizarre time that people shoot a bit where it just comes in and appears
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.720]   and that's trying the same place and goes away again.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.720]   And when he comes back in the evening.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.040]   So he may be thinking on a bit that is nice to foggy.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.080]   I used to live out there.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080]   It's foggy.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.320]   I did not live in that house.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.600]   Plus, if you go to work, you're at work when the sun's out.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.600]   Right.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.080]   Whenever you're home, it's cold and foggy.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:33.680]   Jack Dorsey is not confirming that he's the new owner because of because he wants privacy.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.960]   But it is a beautiful house.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.400]   These are the pictures that were taken for the real estate brochure.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.200]   So Jack will have better, I think a better furnishings than that.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   Yes.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.200]   It certainly helps.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.200]   So nice.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   Very nice.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:54.280]   My tool of the week is I was looking for a good launcher for the Galaxy S3.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.800]   I don't mind touch with Samsung's default interface.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   It's fine.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.320]   But it was taking up more space on the screen than I wanted.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.880]   I wanted something that would let me get more icons on here, eliminate the silly row
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.520]   of buttons that show you what page you're on in the home page.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.720]   But I asked the chat room and they gave me two very good recommendations.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.880]   One is called Apex and one is called Nova.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.880]   This is Nova.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.000]   I chose Nova because it was a little bit, for this screen resolution, it was a little bit
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   better.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.200]   At the layout, I have six rows from top to bottom, five across.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.680]   I'm able to turn off labels on the icons, which saves me space.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.560]   It's got a really nice dock that you can make as big as you want and put some special
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.560]   icons in there.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.400]   I use direct dial and direct text icons so I can quickly reach people.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:40.400]   Really nice.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.400]   Nova, it's called.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:46.960]   There's a free version and then for extra features, you can pay a couple of bucks.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.560]   I think it's worth it.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.160]   There are some really great launcher replacements.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.400]   A dozen of them or more.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.520]   A lot of people like Go Launcher, which is free.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:00.400]   Nova and Apex are specifically for ice cream sandwich and add some really, really nice
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.400]   features.
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:07.080]   This is a good partner for a Samsung Galaxy S3, which is now available as of today, I
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:13.560]   think, for most of the carriers in the US and a phone I once again highly recommend.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560]   I just loves it.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.360]   Hey, thank you for being here.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   We appreciate it.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.680]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.240]   His book, Public Parts, is a must read.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.920]   Get it soon.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.520]   And it's so good to see you back home in Oyster Bay or wherever the hell it is you
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520]   live.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:34.920]   I don't know.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.680]   Kevin Marks apparently lives at the Ferry Building and I think that's a good place.
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.040]   Or Kevin is homeless.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.600]   We need to do a Kickstarter to get Kevin a hole.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.040]   Look for his box right next to Justin Herman Plaza.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.200]   No, actually, Kevin's got a beautiful.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.880]   I was nervous this weekend because I was over at our house was being turned my tent
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.800]   into a million half-week day or weekend.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:54.800]   Oh, dear.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.880]   That was the Jesse Reed I did it on this weekend.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.120]   It's a beautiful day in San Francisco we can tell.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.880]   There's no fog on the bay today.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.480]   I lost you wait.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.840]   We really appreciate you.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:05.840]   Be in there, Kevin.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.520]   It's always great to have you.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:14.720]   And of course to Gina Trapani who is the spiritual hacker soul of this little confab.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:21.400]   You could find her at smarterware.org plus and think up app.com.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.400]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.400]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.400]   Thank you, Kevin.

[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.040]   We love the chatero.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:37.840]   It is democracy unless you piss off one of the mods and then all bets are off.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.840]   Chatero's awesome.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.320]   It's so great.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.320]   We love the chatero.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.320]   Really do.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.400]   And so that's why you want to watch life.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   But if you can't--
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   Chatero's screams off with your heads.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.400]   Ah!
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.680]   If you can't, let them eat cake.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:55.600]   If you can't, you could of course watch or listen after the fact we make audio and
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.640]   video available at twitter.tv and everywhere podcasts live.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.440]   If you like this kind of discussion, stay tuned.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:06.880]   TNT is coming up next with the week's tech news, including information about the new
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.720]   Windows phone announcement.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.800]   We didn't get to that, but that's a big story.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.760]   And then right after triangulation on our guest will be the great Doc Surls, the author
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.840]   of, now it's 11th year, Clutrain.

[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.800]   I have learned so much from Doc.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.800]   I adore Doc.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.800]   He's prudent for me.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.800]   He's the Buddha of Technologies.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.880]   One of the nicest guys out there, just really fantastic.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.880]   And he loves radio.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:33.880]   He's a radio guy.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:34.880]   He's a radio geek.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.360]   He beat all radio geeks.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.880]   I'm with him on that.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.040]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
