[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   It's time for Twig this weekend. Google, Jeff and Gina are here. We're going to take
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.240]   a look at a brand new email program for your mobile and web from Google. A replacement
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.560]   for Gmail possibly. Twitter takes a pivot with its new developer platform. We'll talk
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.160]   about that. And Jeff finally understands why WhatsApp is worth $22 billion. It's all coming
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.920]   up next on Twig.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.920]   As you love from people you trust.

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.320]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Show the not just about Google but the cloud, Facebook,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920]   Twitter, anything we really want to talk about including new media. That's partly because
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   we've got this guy over here, Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.440]   of New York, turning young minds onto the possibilities that remain in the tattered wreck
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.680]   that is journalism. Corrupting them. Great to have you Jeff. Also here founding editor
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.120]   of Life Hacker, programmer, developer, host of All About Android and the creative think
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.440]   up Gina Trapani. Hello. Hi Gina. Gina did us a mitzvah, Jeff. She did indeed. She did
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.400]   a couple of mitzvahs. What's the plural of mitzvahs? It's Vai. Mitzavishis. It's a mitzavishi.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:48.560]   She sent us invites to a new Google service that I think is kind of on the order of a
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.240]   Gmail when it first came out in terms of people wanting it. It's called inbox and they say a marriage
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.680]   of Gmail and Google now. Just to be clear before I start getting a barrage of emails, I do not
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.440]   issue the invites. Yes. I just happen to have you happen to have one. You're followers who follow
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.840]   me on Twitter. I asked they sent exactly three. So thank you. I saved them to my my co-hosts.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.200]   So it's really hard to know exactly what this is. And by the way, you can go to google.com/inbox
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.640]   and request an invite. That's where you should go. Yes. As soon as you know they'll put it up.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.960]   When did yeah well maybe I don't know. Remember Gmail was in beta and you invite only for some time.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.680]   Yeah. That was earlier Google. So what is this and why should we want it to us Lucy?
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.320]   Yeah, because both Jeff and I have it but we don't know what the hell to do with it.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.760]   I'm also trying to figure out what this is. I've only had it for an hour or so and I'm still confused
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:56.000]   by it. But in short, it's a new updated client for Gmail which exists on Android, iOS and the web
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.200]   at inbox.google.com. And it adds features to it's like Gmail supercharged. It's got a little
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.400]   Google now action where you can say set a reminder and remind me about this email in two days.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.200]   It's got some snooze this, a mark that says done. It bundles different types of emails
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.920]   similar to the way priority inbox groups emails by by by subject. It's all material design.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.240]   It's all kind of a new new take on it's got lots of different cool interactions.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.920]   But I'm still figuring it out. I'll be I'll be really honest.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.480]   It reminds me a little bit of mailbox which is an app we've talked about first came out on iOS
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.120]   then Macintosh. And I think there's Android versions now. Same idea. In fact, mailbox really
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.000]   opened people's eyes to a new way of handling mail. You swipe left or right.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.720]   Mailbox has four different states. You could swipe all the way to the left to delete it,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.560]   sort of the way to the left to archive it all the way to the right to make it make it
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.280]   to snooze it. This has those features in it. But but but as you point out, it also incorporates
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.760]   those new categories that were introduced in Gmail a while ago. Promos. But they have new ones too.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.360]   They call these bundles. So there's purchases. Promos. Promos are, you know, basically spakin,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.560]   right? Stuff you agreed to sign up for but don't really want to read. Purchases are actually what
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.920]   you want. Nowadays, especially with Google Wallet and Apple Pay, purchases will collate all of the
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.000]   receipts into one package. Your orders to there's travel. I'm about to travel and be kind of nice to
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.120]   have, you know, all the emails associated with my flight, my rental car, my hotel and one full
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.960]   of stuff. And again, it's not just that you have the email one spot. It's the preview and the
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.920]   listing alone tells you what you need to know. Right. Right. So here's a Virgin America reservation
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:00.880]   on their sample page. And there's a link that says check in. So yeah, I mean, this is Google.com.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.320]   In box. Google.com. This is their preview page. And you can create your own bundles. So I would
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.840]   create, for instance, a Twit bundle for emails from the Twit.tv domain. There's, I see they have
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:23.840]   book club weekend. Woohoo. Ski buddies as samples. So your bundles will could be added to
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.320]   the list of bundles. So bundles are essentially email filters. In fact, the setup is very much
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.840]   like setting up an email filter. Yeah. So it's a little bits and pieces from what you go through.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   Say again. Can you set? Can you do a never show me this again, bundles? Yes. Yes, you could. I presume.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.280]   But it's very easy to get rid of stuff by swiping it off.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.440]   Swipe it one way. It gets rid of it. Swipe it the other way. It snoozes it.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.840]   So all right. Hold on. Let me understand. So you swipe it the one way. That's telling Google,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   I don't care about this. You swipe it the other way. It's telling Google, yes, I care about this.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.400]   Kind of sorta. Well, it's telling Google, remind me about this later.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.720]   I don't care about this right now. Because here's an issue I can imagine for Google.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.160]   Because you can now see the essence of the email in the preview, you might swipe it off. You might
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.920]   say, thank you. Great. I now found out everything. I was very important to me and swipe it off.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.520]   Or you could say, I hate this. I don't want this. I don't care. Please don't prioritize this in the
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.040]   future of Google. And swipe it off. If the same action is the same signal, I don't know how they're
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:41.520]   going to prioritize well. But they'll figure it out. It's interesting. Yeah, this is pretty interesting.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.960]   If you do it on the web, by the way, obviously, it's not a touch screen. So swiping isn't available.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.080]   Unless you have a Chromebook Pixel. Unless you're on a Pixel. Well, I'd be curious if it knows that
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:57.920]   you have touch. On my desktop, I don't have touch, but I have buttons for pin. We didn't mention pin.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:04.400]   Pin is another category. What you could do to triage your email is pin everything you want to save.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.920]   And then there's a sweep button. Microsoft invented this for Outlook mail that will sweep
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:17.440]   sweep unpined items off as done. So the idea, I think the idea is somewhat like the triage
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:24.320]   capabilities of mailbox where you're going toward inbox zero. You're very quickly dealing with
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   everything. Either get rid of it, do something about it, postpone it, or pin it, and then you sweep
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.600]   everything else away. But you see, I just stopped. I've been my favorite. Google taught me not to
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.080]   do that. Google taught me just to leave it and it'll go out below. Well, it doesn't sweeping. It
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.400]   doesn't get rid of it. It just puts it in a. But I don't even do most of my email. I don't do
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.080]   anything to I say. Okay. I know if you look at my email, I have like 30,000 unread emails.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:58.400]   By the way, I might as wrong. I like on my wonderful pixel. The sweeping of an individual item doesn't
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:07.360]   work. Yeah, you have to still use those buttons. Oh, dang. Yeah. I was hoping the web based material
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:15.280]   design would be touch sensitive. That's interesting. Anything you've marked done is stored in a done
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:22.240]   folder as well as our so done just means I'm done with this one. Is that an alias to archive?
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.200]   This is the other question. Yeah. What happens to your normal Gmail?
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.720]   Is this I mean, are you affecting Gmail itself? You've got to be right.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.280]   Yeah, you are. Yeah. Anything you mark done is simply stored here. Emails you previously
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.920]   see archived. You're here too. So it's added. Has it added? I mean, look, it is archive because I don't
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:53.040]   see new boxes with the labels that they talk about. Oh, maybe I do. I see social promotion. Yeah, I do.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.800]   So, so, so you'll also see if you've turned on categorization in the email inbox on Gmail,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.160]   you'll also see those categories there. And I presume if I had another bundle,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:11.920]   I will see that category too. So bundles equal labels in Google's Google speak.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.840]   They behave slightly differently. Right. Because what's the bundle?
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.120]   It was a different characteristics. It seems like the group.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:31.920]   I can't put I can't put bundles I create in the categories list. They now become a new label. So,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:40.160]   bundles I create are really just labels. The bundles Google's created are more categories.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:46.960]   They go in the categories section. Right. All right. They seem to group similar emails in a way,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.440]   even beyond just conversation threads. Right. I like that. I mean, Google does a,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.400]   and I think as I remember, Jeff, you didn't turn on categories in your Gmail. You didn't like that.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.360]   I didn't get the automatic thing. And this got, I wish I could show you guys this.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.560]   This has got some Google now actually going on. So, I'm checking in on a Virgin America flight
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.240]   tomorrow. And so, I have my Virgin America, you know, it's time to check in email. And I've got,
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.400]   you know, the flight number, it looks very Google nowish. It expands down the flight number,
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.640]   willing to check in, you know, New York San Francisco, like it's, it knows that the email.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.560]   So, the key to this to me is that preview is that you don't need to open a lot of it.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.680]   You'll have to open email a lot less than time. Well, what you do is you open inbox instead of email.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.400]   So, say, yeah, but inbox is kind of his email. Right.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.000]   Yeah. I mean, I, okay. I'll make a commitment to use this for the next week.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.880]   I can't do it. I don't use my vanilla Gmail account as my, it doesn't, it doesn't.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.640]   Well, it doesn't. I never use.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:56.080]   I will use it. You know, you probably see you're gonna fix this and you don't. I yelled at you
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.600]   when I was out there. I love you guys. But really, really come on.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.120]   This doesn't, are you saying this doesn't work with your apps account?
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.440]   No. Right. Not yet. It was even worse than that, Leo. Gina nicely sent the invite to me to my
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.280]   apps account. I, I opened it up and says, oh, sorry, sucker. So, she had to send it to my Gmail
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.680]   account for it to work. Yeah. It actually detected whether or not it was in your Gmail inbox.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.160]   Just, you know, they can do that, right?
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.720]   And you know, this is, let me just say, because I went and talked to the work people work.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.040]   Those people are paying for apps now. They're paying for apps functionality to make apps people
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.880]   second the class citizens. Not the best thing.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.400]   I have to say, I have some trepidation about completely trusting
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.920]   this. Leo, Leo, he's bolded.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.160]   Trust the team, Leo. Trust the team.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.880]   We all said the same thing, I think, when priority inbox came out and it has not failed me.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.920]   It is rare. We're still using that.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.360]   We're still using the bottom of the screen.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   See, I don't use priority anymore because I moved to the next thing Google invented,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.640]   called categories. Scatter queries.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.040]   Scatter queries.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.680]   So I use, so I don't have a priority inbox. I have a primary inbox. Same idea, though.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.040]   And that's been reliable. And so, so in a way, having gotten used to now the idea that
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.280]   promotional stuff is in one tab and updates or in another tab,
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.000]   I am perhaps now more likely to use inbox. This is, hey, I'm glad they keep trying.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.200]   Priority inbox just means I ignore more people without guilt, which is a nice thing.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.600]   This is part of the problem is that email is so broken and everybody's trying to figure out a
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.120]   way to fix it. Well, you can't fix email as is you can't add on to the existing infrastructure
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.240]   and it's not going to work. And that's what this is. I'm sorry to say.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.040]   Oh, it has to be, but you've got to totally create an entirely new email
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.000]   infrastructure and ecosystem. Right.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.480]   That's what that and that's the kind of ambition Google could have.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:06.240]   So the other problem I have is that you and I, Jeff, we don't do much with our email. So we just
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.160]   have met 14,838 unread emails in my inbox. Especially because the world emails you.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.200]   Well, I get a lot of email, but this is really about inbox zero, isn't it? I mean,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.840]   this only makes sense if I sweep it every day.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.000]   Yeah. No, no, because I think those previews are key to this.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.520]   But I have all this stuff. I mean, I could scroll forever. I have all this stuff from previous days.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.200]   Maybe I should sweep that out of the way. The problem is, doesn't it do that on my Gmail?
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.640]   So, well, but now it's in the done. I don't know. I disagree.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.240]   People always don't leave the searches. It's not going to get to Gmail. You can't sweep stuff up,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.400]   but you can also just let it go down the screen. Right.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.640]   And it has a clear demarcation for the day in yesterday, which is kind of nice.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.920]   It kind of says, if it was yesterday, you didn't deal with it. You could go back there, but you
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.400]   don't have to. It's just still there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because you only sweep a day's
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:08.800]   worth of mail when you sweep. Isn't that right? Yes. Yeah. Looks that way. So you sweep each day by
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:15.280]   itself. So in the rundown, under this story, I put a report, there were a couple of them,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:23.360]   about a leak of Gmail 5.0. Today's the game. Yeah. Yeah. I believe that this is a different thing.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:30.880]   Yeah. I think that the Gmail 5.0 is actually an upgrade to the native default.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:37.440]   For Lollipop. For Lollipop. Yeah. We're seeing a lot of 5.0 versions. There's Play Store 5.0 as well.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.720]   Right. Basically, Lollipopized.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:49.760]   Okay. But the Gmail 5.0, according to the report, will also handle Yahoo! Mail and other such.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:55.680]   As it should. Right. Because doesn't the default AOSP email program do that already?
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:02.000]   Yeah. Right. So there's a default email client, which is a generic IMAP pop email client.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.800]   Right. And then there's the Gmail app, which handles Gmail. Just Gmail. Now you could always
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.640]   pop or IMAP or I guess just pop to Gmail on the web and then have that bring down, you know,
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:20.000]   or have your email forwarded. This is different. This is actually Gmail, the client acting as just
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.720]   a straight pop three or IP client. You can find inbox as most mail clients will do.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.000]   And I think what that means is they're going to deprecate the AOSP email client
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.440]   and Gmail going forward, Gmail 5.0 will be the default email client in AOSP. That would be my guess.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   I don't think so. I think there's proprietary code. I don't think that they're going to open
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.520]   source the Gmail app. This is proprietary code there. Ah, you're right. So this is why you have
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:52.960]   to buy an X6 phone. Know what the what is official, what is open. But I would guess that on most
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.800]   Nexus phones, Gmail will be kind of the default email app. Right. I don't even have to include an
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.560]   email app because it'll do everything the email app will do. Yeah. Yep.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.400]   But and just to make things more confusing, they've introduced a third mobile email app called
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:17.680]   Inbox. Just because we weren't yet baffled enough. I like Inbox though. I think I could, I think I
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.840]   could get to use it. I think I could like this. Yeah. Now here's the other question I'm going to
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:30.400]   have is that because I'm a Chrome user on airplanes, I use offline email Chrome app,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:37.920]   which is really useful because I can read my mail offline. And the question is, will they make
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:46.080]   this an offline app as well? Hmm. Yeah. I mean, interesting. Yeah. I mean, it seems like that it
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.040]   makes sense that this would be an offline app as well, but probably not there yet. Right.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.800]   I think it's a sink. You have to install it as a Chrome app and then sink it. You say,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.520]   get, you know, sink and then you get on the plane and you've got everything.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.680]   You know, I'd almost like to see is
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:10.240]   them turning Gmail into a true plane IMAP client because right now it has extensions that, for
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:18.160]   instance, of an IMAP emails in one and exactly one folder in with Google's labels, you could
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.960]   have multiple labels. And so there's no direct mapping of Google's Gmail organizational strategy
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.600]   to an IMAP organizational strategy. What if Google just went to true IMAP? That's been a problem,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.320]   for instance, for Apple and its mail app. What if Google just made Gmail an IMAP standard email
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:40.880]   client and then used these third, you know, these other mobile clients and new desktop client as a
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:47.920]   way of doing its oddball labeling system? I think that would be good. Then we wouldn't have an
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.800]   on-standard IMAP on Gmail. But okay, but there's still back-end functionality for, for example,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   priority inbox that adds a lot of value. Yeah. So it's not Gmail is never going to be again just a
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:08.000]   plain vanilla straight feed email account. You could make it into real value add of it as priority
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.560]   inbox and the thinking that goes into the organization. Right. Because priority inbox is one of many
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.040]   labels a single mail can have. There's a lot of thinking that goes in behind that. A lot of
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.720]   computing goes into that. Well, it's just filtering. Yeah. It's filtering, but it's very smart
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.600]   filtering. Oh, okay. Multiple, multiple labels isn't going to go away. I mean, they're just,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.960]   they're not incentivized to get rid of that at all. Right. I mean, if they're incentivized to get
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.840]   more Gmail users, right? Like, like, so their IMAP implementation is a little janky. It works.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.880]   Right. I mean, technically it works, even though, you know, a piece of mail could be in several
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.480]   different folders. Right. They're not actually folders. But I don't see them backing off on the
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.000]   multi label feature because I think it's one of the few things that like distinguishes Gmail.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.920]   Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's real value add.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:59.680]   All right. I got a different question. Okay. So this is presented as an Android slash iOS mobile
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.360]   app, but it also exists on the web. Does this indicate anything about there thinking about
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:11.600]   Android v Chrome Android v web in how things are being developed, what they're being developed for?
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.360]   Well, this is this this web app that inbox at Google.com looks very material design.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.680]   It's got the floating action. Yeah. Yeah. It's got that floating action button.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.280]   It's got the transitions and the list items that kind of expand in place and the nice kind of
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.760]   sliding back and forth. I think that they use polymer to build this. Polymer is a framework
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:40.640]   that basically lets, lets developers, you know, create material design-ish apps on the web. So,
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.960]   yeah, I mean, I think that Google is moving totally into this direction. I think we're going to see
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.320]   it on the web. I think we're going to see in their Android apps, I think that this material
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.760]   design is actually going to be we're going to see influences of it everywhere.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.640]   I have to say I'm just been playing around with this inbox and it does.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.600]   It is a nice thing to be able to really quickly triage email and then sweep the rest away.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   I just went through my whole updates folder and picked one thing I wanted to say,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.480]   swept the rest away. That's great. Same thing with my finance folder. I can go through here.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.280]   And this is all the credit card, you know, warnings and stuff. And I can just sweep it,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.760]   say, "Okay, got it. Sweep it away. This is good. This might really be a good solution."
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:32.800]   I dig it. I dig it, man. But it is going to, it is a learning curve, but I like it a lot. I want it,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.040]   I want it for my apps account. I want it for my primary email. Yeah. So you can't use this as an
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.400]   apps with your apps account. It says what I try to do it. It said your organization isn't ready for
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:51.360]   this. Yes, they are. I think it's in terms of service privacy issue. I think that it takes them
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:58.400]   longer for whatever legal reasons to opt, you know, apps, organizations into the kind of permissions.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.880]   Give them excuses. I still think they haven't figured out the damned to account thing.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:10.960]   That's fair. Maybe. I love them. I love them. I did amazing work, but you know, this is the,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.360]   when Gina and I were going to the email like before, I just said, you know, Q Jarvis S fit.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:22.800]   I didn't say that, didn't it? Hey, I've just gone through all of my, while you have been talking,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.640]   gone through all of my email and swept away everything but three messages, which I pinned.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:35.200]   I got to at least daily in box zero for 10 minutes. Congratulations.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.280]   Great. I mean, that was really easy, but that was great.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.960]   Yeah. I mean, that's, that's certainly was the purpose of apps like mailbox, right?
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.800]   And it seems like inboxes following in those footsteps is giving you an easy way to clear out
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.680]   your inbox. It's very influenced by mailboxes, isn't it? Not a lot of people,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.480]   not everybody clears out their inbox every day. No, I don't. That's why it's such a big deal that
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:07.840]   I did for the first time in my life while you were talking. And that's, and it does reflect
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:13.200]   itself back on your regular Gmail interface, which is nice. So when you, when you pin it,
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.000]   what happens with it? It then now stays in that inbox until you handle it.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.440]   Yeah. And when you pin something, you can no longer sweep it away. So what you, so this is
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.720]   what I just did. I went through each bundle, scanned it, pinned the ones I knew I wanted to act upon,
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.440]   ignored the ones I knew I didn't care about now that I've read them or at least looked at them,
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   and swept everything away. So I had basically,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.680]   That's like starring was, but instead of going into a separate star category, it now stays in
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.120]   the field. Yes. And you have this sweep command, which means that once you start stuff, you can get
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.920]   rid of the stuff you didn't, you start. Right. And then then then you can separately,
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.600]   you can say, remind me about this in three days, right? Yeah, that's a separate thing.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.600]   A separate thing. So there's pinning and there's snoozing pinning is saying, stay here. I'm not
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   done with you. Snoozing is reminding tomorrow. And I did snooze three or four things.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.680]   And there's archiving and killing. There's not because before you really basically couldn't kill
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.120]   Gmail. I mean, that you could, but they made it difficult. They said, don't, why bother?
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   So now there's a distinction between archiving and killing. Yeah. Well, it's, yeah, trash or archive.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.280]   Yeah, you don't have a trash button on this, by the way, the way they think about it.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:26.800]   There's no trash button on this. The worst, the worst you can do to email is put it in done,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.560]   which you say Gina is the same as the other times when you want to erase, erase, erase things.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:37.760]   I mean, your own email that you have a right to forget. No, sorry, erase, erase, erase, and email.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.840]   No, sorry, you don't get to erase, erase, erase it. That's an issue for companies that have lawyers
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.800]   saying, get rid of the digital paper trail. Oh, wait a minute. I take it back.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   Okay. So the big three buttons and the swipe choices are pin snooze done. But then there's a
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.080]   menu, there's a three button menu thing. And in there, it says move to and among other things,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.960]   you can move it to trash or move it to spam or move it to bundles or unbundled.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.200]   So I have this vision that somewhere at Google right now, there's, there's three people from
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.480]   this team having beer laughing at us. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look for the look over there.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.640]   Look over there. I don't think I think what they're doing is rooting for us. You'll figure it out.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.760]   Come on. You got laughing. Okay. Okay. Do you get it? Do you get it? No. Okay, keep trying.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:34.480]   I think this actually I'm kind of liking it, but yeah, we'll see. The location based reminders are
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.680]   pretty cool too. Pick a does that. Yeah. So you could say snooze until there are a couple of
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   previous choices later today, tomorrow you could pick a date of time where they could pick a place.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.960]   When I get to work, remind me about the email. By the way, even though I
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.280]   swept my inbox now, there's like 30 more emails in there. Got you. That's the first one.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.760]   Told you. I just fixed it. I just cleaned you out. That's when you're going to give up is what's
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.680]   going to happen. The fan email? What what what what fills you up immediately?
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:10.240]   Just yes. Lots of stuff. Bacon. A lot of bacon.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.520]   Has you signed up for crap over the years? No, but I mean, it's also, you know, any time I use
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.760]   my credit card card, not present, I get an email anytime. I also turn on alerts and financials
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.040]   things and there's just a lot of email. It's just a lot. I go back. The thing I've mentioned
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.240]   in the show over the years is that Marissa Meyer talking about the hyper personal news stream.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.560]   Right. Google is trying to let you know at a glance what you need to know in the context
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.520]   of your needs. Right. That's Google's goal. And they very cleverly bit by bit, piece by piece,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:50.400]   find new ways. Here's the way I've been putting it lately. In Seoul, they asked me to do what
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.080]   would Google do presentation. I'm thinking it's five years old. Hey, great. What would Google do
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:00.640]   five years later? So, you know, I look back and Android was new in that time. And I really saw
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:07.520]   that Google is a personal services company. Yeah, I agree. And that's the key. That's just so key
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.360]   to where Google is. And I saw the glimmers of where it was going, but it just this whole notion
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.240]   that I talk about of them being in the signals business. The reason is because they unlike mass
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:22.640]   media, unlike mass manufacturers, marketers, unlike government, Google gives you personal
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.360]   service. That's their goal. And what better thing for them to put their big brains to work on than
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:35.440]   solving email? But again, that's where I said earlier in the show, I think that that's not they
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:42.240]   have not moonshot at this. The moonshot for email is to invent an entirely new. That was Google Wave.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.880]   And we saw what happened with it. Because it was reciprocate, it was recipient control communication.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.400]   Wave was absolutely a moonshot effect. It was wasn't it some of the Gmail team was involved.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.760]   It was the Google maps. It was the maps.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.960]   His brother came from maps. Yeah, came from maps. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.840]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, wave was a shot at that buzz. You know, you could argue that social networks
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.600]   are the better email. The problem. I defend email and I want email to stick around because it's the
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.640]   only truly federated system that everybody uses. That's great. You know what I mean? That's easy
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.600]   to set up and everyone uses. Yeah, we're not reinventing email. We're reinventing how we
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.400]   perceive it and process it. Now, but you're trying to fix its inherent
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.240]   vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Well, and there's no Google could invent something new that's
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:38.320]   federated. No, no, no, no, it wouldn't be federated to be Google. And then you'd have to get everybody else
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:43.120]   to agree to do it. Here's the difference because Gina was right. Just a minute. Google plus
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:47.360]   Bob, my friend Bob, why I'm in at Google lecture me years ago. And he said, Jarvis, the problem with
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.800]   G with email, that from the day one, I know the day the decision was made is when it became
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:58.240]   center control. And we talked about this in the show back when Google plus started,
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.040]   Google plus is recipient controlled. And that's the essence of an entirely different
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.880]   communication schema. But you're right. That's just Google and that's the weakness of it is it's
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.600]   just Google. What if you truly could imagine a federated recipient controlled Google plus
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.640]   where not every fine, you're still going to have email, Gina, and you're still going to get the
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.160]   stuff that you didn't ask for and whatever. And Google's still going to help you try to fix that
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.240]   as best as it can. But what if all your really important communication went through? And what
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.280]   do we do instead? Right? We try Facebook, Facebook is controlled, not federated, limited. It's the
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.080]   closest thing we have to everybody being there, but it's not built to communicate. It's not what
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.880]   it's there for. What is federated? Would you explain that Gina? I think Gina could do this.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.120]   Federated is when is a peer to peer network where there's several different servers,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.760]   all of whom have the same on the same ground, right? They all have the same amount of power
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:01.040]   and they exchange information peer to peer. They're equals, exactly, versus a collection of
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:06.400]   servers controlled by one company that serves out to clients. So when email first started,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:14.160]   it was that latter situation. You had MCI mail or you had Gini or you had AOL, you had CompuServe,
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:21.600]   and you could email anybody within that system. But getting email from MCI to AOL was very hard
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.800]   because it had to go through a gateway. And it was just hard. You had to know how to do it. You
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:32.880]   had to know the right address. So they solved that problem by federating, by saying, look,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:42.400]   everybody has a canonical email address that is some name at and the host that hosts your email,
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.800]   AOL or Gini or MCI mail. So they had a system of naming that everybody understood. And then they
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.120]   set up the interconnect. So you didn't have to even think about it. You just I would write to
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:02.640]   Gini at AOL.com and it would get to you. This is pre TCIP. Yes, it is. I mean, well, not exactly.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:10.480]   But TCP is free web. It's pre web. No, it was also pre TCIP. Was it? Was it?
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:18.000]   Yes, it is because it's using SMTP and pop or some other system. Right. Right.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.160]   But the federation of all those pop and iMac servers, and that's kind of one of the cool things,
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.040]   is that not only did you, you could you be on disparate servers, you could be a service that
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   used different protocols, pop or iMac or exchange. And the email would still magically get to where
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.200]   you sent it as long as you knew the address. And that really worked quite nicely, right?
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.360]   I mean, the problem was this was a different time, right? Like this was 1971 when we were just
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.400]   trying to get the network to work. Right. Now there's no company that's financially incentivized
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.760]   to make a federated system. There just isn't. Right. There's no there's no reason why any company
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.640]   would say everybody can have an equal copy of the data that we can have. Why? Why?
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.080]   Twitter doesn't want to do federated. They want to do Twitter. If a Facebook doesn't want to
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.440]   do federated, they don't want to do Facebook. Google doesn't want to do federated. They want to
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.760]   do G Google. I think if you go to the, I would argue if you go to the WordPress model.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.440]   So what, you know, people thought, some people thought we're. RSS is federated. RSS was an
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.360]   attempt to create a federated protocol that would cross all of these systems.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:29.040]   Yes. But people, I think Gina is right. There's no economic incentive to do this.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.360]   Let me argue the WordPress model. WordPress versus movable type, right?
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.720]   Moveable type said, we own the software and yes, we'll let it out there, but we're going to limit
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.200]   it because we're going to go into business and we don't want you to compete with us.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.280]   WordPress on the other hand said, nope, software, open source, stays at the .org.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.800]   Anybody can do it. And we're just the first company to build on top of it.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.840]   And indeed, it's a great business. Mullenweg has a genius business there where he's building
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.680]   great business, but I can use the WordPress underlying code and I can start my own hosting
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.720]   company, compete with WordPress.com and Mullenweg still benefits because I'm going to contribute
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:12.480]   to the code base. By the way, we've conflated several different OSI levels. TCP IP is still the
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:19.200]   protocol on top of which SMTP and pop run. That's just yeah, but that's simply a communication
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:25.120]   protocol. And then there is there's an email protocols that are well understood. And similarly,
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.240]   we're interested at a higher level still than that. All I was trying to suggest there by that was
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:38.640]   that even before we had broad use as standardized use of net, you could connect MCI mail, which was
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.440]   not TCIP, which was not internet. We don't know what protocol services.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.640]   Who a protocol, right? That's all. Yeah, there was a gateway. Right. Yeah, there was a gateway.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.840]   Yeah. But you know, the best example of this is an XMPP, which is a federated protocol.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:59.920]   It was a Jabber protocol. Google used it for G talk. And what did Google do? They killed it.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.480]   They said, you know, we don't want to support that anymore because exactly as you said,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.440]   Gina, they have no economic incentive to do that. They have every incentive to create a proprietary
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.000]   protocol that you can only use on Google and not to interoperate with everybody else.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.960]   Yeah. I mean, the pattern is kind of you make this amazing client that works with a standard
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.000]   protocol that anybody, you know, can can can implement, right? But then your client becomes so
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.480]   good and so specialized and so proprietary that after a while you don't support the protocol.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.960]   Like I like I look at GitHub, for example, you know, Git is a distributed version control system.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:38.320]   And everyone that runs Git has a has an equal copy of the data and, you know, GitHub, but GitHub
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:44.160]   itself is this amazing Git client with a bunch of add-ons pull requests and social and tagging
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:50.480]   and user profiles and and wikis and and and and website hosting, right? And people love GitHub is
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.200]   a great place to collaborate, but it is controlled by one company, but it's based on this open source
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.640]   software, right? Much like much like WordPress. Now, WordPress has Jetpack, which is their sort of
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:06.320]   proprietary layer kind of on top of WordPress that you that gives you lots of things, site stats and
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.280]   that kind of thing, but it all feeds back to automatic, which is the commercial entity on top of.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.320]   This is think-ups model. I mean, we're an open source software, but we're, you know,
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.080]   we're and we're a hosted, you know, we're a company building a hosted service on top of it because it's
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.280]   if it's too much of a pain to set it up yourself. And that in that definitely works, but there's
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.160]   definitely a tension between, you know, of course, we're building this client, say this I am client,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.360]   and we're going to have Java support in it, right? Until it gets so big and so good and so proprietary
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.040]   and so embedded into our system that, you know, it's just too much work to support Java anymore.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.920]   You should just use our stuff, you know, there's just better. Yeah, right. I'm just I'm just wishing
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.600]   for some scenario or someone totally reinvents email. Email. Well, but, but okay, I'd say,
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:55.520]   let me say, say one thing is that that's the application layer and email. All email is is a
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.520]   protocol for exchanging messages using universally accepted canonical addresses.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:07.120]   And there's a protocol for saying I got all the pieces. I mean, there's a lot of underlying stuff.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:14.320]   The presentation layer is can be anything. That's what Google's doing with inbox. That's the client.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.280]   And so I think what you watch is a replacement on the presentation layer. I don't think no,
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:25.440]   no, no, I'm going to disagree. I want people to not be able to send me anything unless I have
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.720]   approved it. Well, we've had systems like that as an anti spam systems for some time. Remember,
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.800]   I used to hate this. You get an email for some amazing. Well, Jeff's not accepting email. And
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.080]   if you prove you are who you think you are. Well, but I again, I think that's annoying, Jeff. You
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:47.360]   don't want that. How does Google plus operate? Right? Google plus is a model for this. I don't
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:54.160]   get and listen to Mike Elgin, right? Mike Elgin, Mike Elgin is Devorak 2.0, right? Devorak, I get
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:37:03.040]   John, I get no spam Devorak. I get no trolls. Elgin, right? So Elgin, I agree. And that's by the way,
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.920]   why I have completely moved all my social interactions to Google plus.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:13.040]   Ah, you see, he's right. The question is the big complaint about Google plus is what? Nobody's
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.560]   there. Just our geeky friend. Just us. Right. And everybody with a Gmail account hat could
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:24.960]   conceivably be on Google plus. What would make Google plus explode opening up? I don't want it to
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:33.040]   explode. I mean, in my circle of friends, my team, my company, they laugh when I mentioned Google
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:40.480]   plus. It's a punch line. I mean, really, there's a certain community who's heavy iPhone Twitter
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:48.160]   users, for whom Google plus is some weird, it's a cultural indicator of some weird,
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.280]   ASPy Googler, excuse my, I'm sorry to apologize. I like that though. I know what you're saying.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.000]   I never heard that phrase before, but I like it. I have it here.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.640]   It is a little offensive, but that's okay. We all know what you're saying. I'm actually really
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:11.360]   regretting saying that. I'm sorry. I never heard that before. You know, but it is. There is something
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:17.760]   about it. Yeah, I know. Jeff and I will not let her. No, move on. Move on. Move on.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.200]   No, but I find that interesting because I would think everybody you know would understand and love
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:32.800]   Google plus. I come to you and on all about Android to be with my people, my fellow Google
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.280]   fans. But you know, there's a lot of folks out there who just aren't who aren't about it, you know,
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.000]   but you know, but that's it. Yeah. And they think Twitter's great.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:51.680]   People love the Twitter. I know. I know. Listen, everybody's got the Twitter numbers. I
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.320]   this all this week, I have the top editors from Bird of the big German publisher with me,
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.120]   and I'm brainwashing them and we're going around great quarters and we visited Twitter. It was a
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.560]   great visit, but the numbers on Twitter, especially in Europe, are really small. What's app is is
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.960]   much bigger in a lot of countries. And what's the deal about WhatsApp? WhatsApp is more recipient
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:18.480]   control. That's true. You can't WhatsApp me. Let's say I approve you, right? Yeah. So maybe
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.560]   what's happens when I'm looking for you, though, I don't use it. But there are a lot of cases where
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:30.800]   you want somebody you haven't prior previously approved. That's what email becomes. That's okay.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.320]   We do need a separate system. All right. Well, then Jeff, you don't want to reinvent email.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:42.960]   You just want to stop using it. I want to I want to make it less important to me. Right.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.280]   Well, I think inbox is kind of about that. It's kind of about saying, well, here's stuff here.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.040]   If we do this organizational stuff, you can quickly find the stuff that you want to get an email
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.920]   and all of your work transactions can happen elsewhere. Right. Sorry about that.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.800]   It'd be nice if actually if inbox could forward could say, you seem to be talking to that person
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   a lot. Why don't you go move to WhatsApp? That would be good. That would be good.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:14.160]   Should we just change that to a WhatsApp account? Maybe that's what the link is to do.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:20.320]   That Facebook has WhatsApp and Facebook has Messenger. And I was just saying a few minutes ago that
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.960]   Facebook's not a communications company. All right. Facebook is not a communications application.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.480]   But Facebook is becoming a communications company. Yeah. And you know what's happens is people want
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.640]   to want me to use Messenger. And some people insist on communicating with me with Messenger.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:41.040]   And this is the problem with Messenger. Jeff, because unlike WhatsApp, if you have a Facebook
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.800]   account, you have a Messenger in inlet. And so WhatsApp, you have to explicitly say, I'm going to
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.880]   allow that person to share with me unless he knows my phone number. He can't. And for Facebook,
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:56.800]   anybody who has a Facebook account can can bother you. So your canonical address in this world
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:02.160]   becomes your phone number. And using that, figuring that this is okay, I see the brilliance WhatsApp
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.840]   now suddenly, knowing that everyone has a canonical address. But it can build something across that.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.160]   But it's not widely known. What? But it's not widely known. Only your friends know it.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:17.360]   But you can choose how it's on my business card. You can choose how to put it out there. You
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:23.600]   could also have some choice whether to accept or not. My point is this. Google and Google+
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.160]   tried to make everybody get a canonical address called a Gmail address. And they finally gave up.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.400]   WhatsApp more cleverly said, no, no, no, we can nobody can make this happen,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.960]   which is Gina's point. Nobody's going to build that. There already is a new canonical address.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.320]   It's the phone number. What can we build on top of that? And people are saying in the
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.760]   chatroom, well, you can face you can. What's happening? But you know, their phone number. Well,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.200]   that's the point is that you control the phone number and much more tightly than you do your
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.960]   email address. Yeah. I mean, we're also speaking as people who publicize our email address a lot.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.560]   Maybe we should be able to have a mistake. Yeah. I mean, you know, you had to think about the
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.840]   fact that that email electronic mail was built on the model of like an electronic version of postal
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.640]   mail. Well, somewhere where if someone has your street address, they can send you a letter, right?
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.880]   Right. But they're going to post a mail and electronic mail is that with postal mail,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.640]   the onus is on the sender. They have to pay for a stamp. They have to get the envelope. It's a
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:22.400]   pain. It's a pain to send somebody a letter, right? With email, the onus is on the recipient because
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.360]   it's because it costs so little and because it's so easy for the sender to send email. If you if
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:32.000]   you publicize your email address on websites, it get millions of hits versus your postal address
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.560]   in a white pages, you know, you're going to get killed with email. Here's the easy fix. I don't
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.120]   know why I didn't think of this. Jeff, this is all you do. And many people do this. You have
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.160]   different email addresses. You have a public email address. You have one you give to a close circle
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.560]   of friends when you only give to intimates. I have enough trouble dealing with the two I have.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:55.360]   But that's really what you're doing with it. What's happening? Well, my phone number is a little
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.240]   bit more secure. So I'm going to use that for the most intimate conversations. In a neve-- no, no.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:07.120]   Here's why Leo. Here's why I don't think that'll work because inevitably it leaks in the spammer
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:14.320]   world and it gets ruined. Well, I have a friend who has solved this. My friend changes his email
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:21.200]   address yearly in a regular-known fashion. His friends will know what to do each year to change
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.080]   his email address and to be able to get through to him. And he deprecates last year's email address.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:33.600]   It's brilliant. What a pain. But I know as his close friend, I know how to email him.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:39.520]   I'm going to start doing that. Leo, here's the deal on what's app.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:45.200]   On WhatsApp, not only do you have everything Gina just explained, you also have at the moment
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.120]   of someone trying to communicate with you, you have the option at that time to say, "No."
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:54.160]   Can you block them? Oh, you just decline. Decline and they can never contact you.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.120]   Yeah, I think so, can't you? But you're just doing what you are actually just doing what you
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.360]   could do with an email address, which is have a higher security one and a lower security one.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.800]   That you can't spam WhatsApp. If your email address leaks out in any way,
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.680]   it will prop your email will propagate against spam world.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:20.480]   So if your phone number leaks out in any way, the idea is really your phone number is not as
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.560]   easy to use as an email address. And you'll get invitations, but you have the opportunity
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.200]   at that moment to refuse the invitation, right? I get it. I don't use WhatsApp folks to tell me.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.720]   That's why WhatsApp is worth $22 billion right there. You nailed it.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:37.440]   Yeah, because I've now seen the architectural insight into it.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.560]   And in the Zuckerberg's appreciation for it.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.960]   This kind of segues that the email or the email address versus phone number,
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.400]   conversation kind of segues a little bit into the announcements that Twitter made today.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.000]   Did you guys see that trying to basically get it?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.920]   Let's take a break and talk about those. We also have third quarter results for Google,
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.040]   lots of news. But we are going to take a break now because we're brought to you by a fine company
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:06.720]   that's up in Canada that we love so dearly. It's called hover.com. This is it's a quality service
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:13.040]   run by nice guys who really protect you. They do the right thing. For instance, they take all the
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.840]   hassle and friction out of registering a new domain name. They know you want who is privacy.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.800]   They just include it. They don't give you 50 checkboxes and upsell you five ways from Sunday
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:28.720]   before you can buy the domain name. Right now is a great time to get a domain name at hover.com.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:34.960]   They've lowered the prices on 200 plus extensions. Many TLDs, they reduced the price for a new
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.320]   dot com domain name. It's now 12.99 a year who is privacy always included. And that's one of the
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:45.280]   reasons you can't just kind of can't compare with it because they have the best domain name
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:52.320]   management system. Let's you set up DNS, do all the right things. And it's so easy to use.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.560]   Unless in five minutes, you'll find the domain name you want, buy it and get it up and running.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.560]   They even have a valet transfer service. This is highly, look, not available, but here's some other
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:08.400]   choices. I highly recommend that when you move to hover, you get let them do it. It's free. They'll
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.040]   take care of the entire process for you. They'll transfer your DNS settings and everything at
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   no additional cost. Then you get all the benefits of hover.com. They've got great customer support.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.360]   They're famous for their no wait, no hold, no transfer phone service. When you call,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:29.360]   you will get a representatives who's empowered to fix your problem. Not that you're going to have
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:33.760]   any. They're so good. I've never had to call them. They also offer volume discounts. If you're
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.560]   one of those people who likes to register a lot of domains or you've got a bunch of domain
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.840]   renewals coming up, the volume discounts started 10 known domains and go up in value from there.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:50.080]   You can add email to any of your domains. They have every one of all weird top level domains as
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:56.400]   well as the dot com and dot net. I just think they're great. Hover gives you exactly what you need
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:04.320]   to get the job done with no fuss. H-O-V-E-R dot com. 10% off your first purchase when you use our
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:14.880]   offer code twig 10. Take advantage of that. Twig 10 at hover h-o-v-e-r dot com. Just do it. Just
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:22.640]   do it. Hover's great. Yeah, see? Unsolicited. We've all suffered so much and I've moved,
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.680]   you know, I kept trying to remember who was the first one that everybody used. Can't remember.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.760]   Anyway, this is pre-dead elephants and Nazgar. Yeah, pre-dead elephants and Nazgar babes.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:42.240]   I admit I had an account with them at one time. I did too. And it was so, it felt so nice
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.800]   to move over to hover. See ya. Yeah, bye-bye. So what did Twitter just do?
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:54.320]   So Twitter had a-- You're gonna have to play in this one. Yeah, so Twitter had a their first
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   developer conference in several years. It's actually going on today in San Francisco, but they had a
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.280]   live keynote this morning and they introduced a bunch of stuff. Basically, they're trying--
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.840]   bunch of stuff for developers. Okay, so none of this is really consumer facing yet.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:13.920]   But essentially a mobile toolkit of a bunch of tools that help developers embed tweets and sign
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.000]   in with Twitter. They're not telling people to develop Twitter clients. They're telling them to
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.800]   put Twitter in their application. Put Twitter in your mobile application. And one of these
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:30.080]   tools that they introduced is called Digits. And it's their effort at removing email addresses and
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:36.560]   passwords from signing up for mobile apps. So Twitter product managers kind of traveled the
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.720]   world to do some research on how people use the web and how does Twitter get new users. And one
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.600]   of the things they found is that the farther that you go away from the United States, the less likely
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   it is that someone has an email address. Everyone's mobile phone is the way that they identify themselves.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:59.360]   So what Digits does is it's this-- It's a bit of UX. You can embed into your mobile app that lets
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:06.880]   users sign up for your app using your mobile phone number. So you enter your number that your app
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:13.440]   SMSes you in authorization code, you enter the auth code, and you're in. No email address, no
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:20.400]   account activation, right, exactly. So similar to the way WhatsApp and Yo works.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.120]   So I just reminded me because what Jeff was saying earlier was like, "Oh, right."
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:32.320]   This makes sense. This makes sense. Gina, but this is a bigger, huge strategy shift for Twitter.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:40.160]   Yes. And it depends upon developers trusting Twitter. Notice we started this saying, "Well,
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.280]   Twitter has an end of developers conference in a few years because the developers would have
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:49.600]   thrown spic balls out of the way that it's created developers before. So explain to me what a developer,
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:55.200]   what you in an app would get out of doing this in your app and then explain to me what--
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.440]   then Twitter, as far as I can tell, gets to be at the center of things and gets to sell ad
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.080]   revenue and gets data. Okay. What does the developer get? Why would you build on this?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:09.920]   Yeah. So I mean, this is from what I understand, this is a mobile developer's tool kit. I think
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.200]   that it's totally-- Is this fabric? Yeah. Fabric is part of it.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:22.080]   Is it like material or textile? The idea that Twitter is offering
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:30.960]   development tools and SDKs to help mobile developers get particular tasks done in their app,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.520]   like single sign-on, like embedding a tweet, like getting crash statistics.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.640]   Crashlytics, they call it. Crashlytics is one of the things that they're offering, right?
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.440]   So as a developer-- They should have fail-- fail-alytics.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:51.760]   Is this mean that's hosted by Twitter and you're going through Twitter's services, or does this
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:57.440]   mean this is just a standard separate from Twitter? These are like bits of code and that you can
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:03.280]   embed into your mobile app that-- It's an SDK. So yeah, it's an SDK. You embed them on your
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.040]   mobile app and so yes, I mean, Twitter is collecting, for instance, your crash report,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.640]   since you log into Twitter to see what those look like. And yes, users maybe are signing in with
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.560]   Twitter, so you're using Twitter's authorization, but that's the same as using sign-in with Facebook,
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.800]   or signing with Google. Basically, Twitter is trying to make life on mobile developers as easy
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.080]   as possible and they're trying to make Twitter a central part of any mobile app.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.560]   And the way that they're trying to do that is to offer these best-in-class developer tools.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:35.840]   Now, Twitter's basically said that they've learned a lot developing their own mobile apps and they
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:40.320]   want to share what they've learned and the tools that they have internally with the developer community.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.960]   And this isn't unprecedented, right? Like if you look at Bootstrap and actually Twitter's
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.880]   open source and released a lot of different frameworks and things, in fact, I use Bootstrap
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.920]   all the time. It's great. I mean, it's a fantastic framework. They're good at making developer tools.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:52:01.840]   Most developer tools are pretty crappy. So as a developer, this is attractive to me. Maybe
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.320]   they're offering something for me, something here, better than the app stores, crash logs,
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.880]   or the Play Store's crash logs. Android is a first-class citizen in this effort from what I
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:16.640]   understand. Really good tools here for Android as well. So you have Twitter, which is not Apple,
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:22.240]   and it's not Google, right? So it's kind of this neutral third party that lets you build
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.480]   add-in components to your mobile app that you don't have to code yourself, right?
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   So the thing is, you're building your app. Your app does something, right? But it also needs all
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.240]   these other things, right? It needs sign-in. It needs crash reports. It needs all these little
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.360]   bits of functionality. You don't want to, as a developer, you don't want to spend time on that.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.120]   You don't want to reinvent the wheel. You don't want to have to do that for every app that you build.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.160]   So that's what Twitter is trying to offer. Twitter's done this before. Didn't they have
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.000]   Bootstrap, wasn't that? Yeah, Bootstrap was one of the frameworks that Twitter offers.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.240]   Twitter makes really great developer tools. So as a developer, if you put in all these things
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:00.160]   into your app, what is Twitter getting out of it? Twitter gets more users, particularly
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.240]   with the sign-in stuff. And they get Twitter in your app. They get Twitter in your app. They get
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:10.080]   tons more tweet impressions. They get to control or they have something to say about the way that
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.280]   you're displaying their content, so the way that they're displaying tweets. So when you display a
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:22.400]   tweet, there's generally functionality shown with it, like favorite retweet, reply, DM, etc.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:27.600]   Is this even about tweets? I'm sorry? Is this even about tweets? Well it is, because
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.320]   in fact what it does is it kind of changes Twitter to be an infrastructure.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:37.280]   What people often thought, Twitter would be like the dial tone of the internet,
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:42.240]   and it kind of makes it more of that. It's not so much about the public presentation of
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:48.320]   Twitter as a whole, but how Twitter is used as a communication medium within your app.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.520]   Yeah, it makes it a mobile platform company is what it does, which is a huge shift.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.440]   Right? So this isn't at all about the consumer products.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.320]   Very interesting. Yeah, it is. And I like it because yeah, that eliminates the whole
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:06.640]   trollish nature of Twitter because you control the community because it's whoever's using your app.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:12.400]   Okay, hold on, hold on. Explain that. Let's see. Well, right now there's a public facing
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.240]   Twitter that's everything, right? Whoever you follow and all the garbage that goes into that,
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:23.440]   and whoever adds you and whatever. And it's just a big mound of horse poo with a pony buried somewhere
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:31.760]   in there. The bird flying over it. I think money birds dropping more horse poo.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:39.280]   So I would think that this would be, let's say I'm the voice right now on the voice. What they do
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.320]   is they say, vote on Twitter, put hashtag the person's name and it's part becomes part of that
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:50.640]   pile of poo, but a voice app could could incorporate this all in it, use Twitter as more of a back
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:58.080]   and infrastructure and surface just the appropriate tweets into the app, making it much more useful
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:05.680]   for the voice and its users and viewers and much less a part of the massive car wreck that is
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:12.880]   Twitter today. And Twitter still gets the benefit, right? In fact, it's better for them because they
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.120]   now can say they can now say to advertisers, Hey, by the way, we get all these people using the
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:23.680]   voice and we can and they can monetize it. And what is Twitter's problem bid? What
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.160]   was the other discussion I had about Germans and Twitter? They need more signups. So they become
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:35.120]   infrastructural. Right. You saw. All right. So the question you have to ask and you know,
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:41.520]   maybe it's just Twitter smokes more now and it's nicer. But but if Twitter does what it's done before
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:49.920]   and pulls the rug out, what happens to your apps? This is the grand question of any developer who
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:54.000]   depends on a third party service, you know, when they build when they build that circles back to
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.520]   that discussion of Federation versus silo. Well, you know, it's the convenience versus risk, you
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.920]   know, the thing that we owe it to. I mean, look, you know, I build an app based on Twitter. I
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.160]   we use Amazon payments. I, you know, we use Google Analytics like we're dependent on, you know,
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.920]   my companies depend on all these third party services that at any moment could change their
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.920]   mind or take it down or block us. And that's kind of, you know, it's kind of one of the trade-offs
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.560]   that you make when you decide to make an app. Now, Twitter did in a lot of developers views
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.960]   totally screw over the developer community. Marco wrote a post about this. I thought it was a
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:31.680]   little heavy handed personally, but I get it like I get that client makers felt really burned
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.560]   by Twitter doing, you know, kind of a 180 from a very open API to a very limited API.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.720]   These announcements they made today are pretty separate than that. They're orthogonal. But, you
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.040]   know, I was at the original Twitter developer conference. I think they did it in, it was called
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.280]   CHIRP. And I think it happened in 2010. And at that conference, they announced a thing called
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:56.000]   annotated tweets, which was a way to like pack lots of different information into a tweet,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.560]   like any sort of metadata that you wanted. Right. Which was a great idea. And they deprecated it.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.840]   It never happened. I don't even think it ever launched. So I don't, I don't, I actually think
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.600]   fabric is not that was treating by the way Twitter more like XMPP. That's exactly what XMPP does.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.880]   Right. They were trying to figure out a way, hey, we want to push packets across the network and
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.520]   however developers define it. I mean, it was a very exciting big idea. It never really happened.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.080]   Fabric appears to be less vaporware. I mean, I think you can actually download some of these
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:29.680]   components and use them now. I think devs understand this and already are using it by using the
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.360]   Twitter authentication system. Right. And this is this, you're a step, look, I don't think this
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:39.440]   is a risk for a developer that you get all these benefits and if Twitter goes away, which doesn't
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   look like it's going to do anytime soon, you go, you do Facebook. So not much Twitter dying.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.880]   It's about Twitter changing the rule. Well, they changed the rules and you change the Facebook. I
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:53.760]   mean, right, we all, we all have Facebook connected Twitter. But now here's the problem, Leo. And
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.360]   I listen, Twitter sign up is extremely convenient. Twitter and Facebook sign up,
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.120]   extremely convenient. Google sign up is never really taken off, but it's there.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.800]   And those are all like crazy Android devices. You use it like crazy.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:10.560]   But at some point, if I sign in through a service through Twitter, that's where my linkage is.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.280]   And if Twitter changes the rules or I'm violating Twitter's rules and Twitter pulls back on me or
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:20.800]   whatever, or my light switch goes off. Well, I feel like this is I hope and it may not be,
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.680]   but it almost feels like Twitter is reinventing itself. It does. I'm trying to understand that.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.360]   And I want to trust it. I'm trying to put it in the context of Twitter's culture and behavior
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.520]   previously. I think that's important. Well, maybe they want to turn over your leaf, Jeff.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.440]   Maybe they want to be better now. Maybe they want to turn over new leaf.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.840]   And they've got that's fine, but they got to they got to acknowledge the past and they've got to
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:49.760]   give us reasons for future trust. I think Twitter must see the writing on the wall at this point,
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:58.080]   that the public facing Twitter has some real problems. Don't you? I mean, it's obvious to me.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:03.600]   You know, all the harassment and gamer gate. How does it how does it happen? Twitter.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:10.480]   This is Twitter is yeah, Arab Spring, blah, blah, blah. Great.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:18.000]   But the truth is Google plus and Facebook don't have nearly the problem the Twitter has with
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.040]   harassment. Most her Twitter has become the channel for harassing people. Yes. Yeah, agreed.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:30.160]   They must know how to fix that. It lets you have a little world, maybe for
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:36.000]   the voice where you see the voice stuff, but that's not. People use Twitter to create communities.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.720]   And it's a form of federation because they're all through Twitter, but it's all owned by Twitter.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.480]   So what do I do? So I belong to a hundred different Twitter communities.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:51.680]   Well, you have a single Twitter sign on and you'll notice when you use an app that has a Twitter
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:57.040]   interface, hey, good news. And you will see in that app only the stuff that's really germane
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.120]   and apo pop using Twitter. I'll come across Twitter like an Intel chip here and there.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:08.560]   It'll be everywhere. They hope. I don't know. Maybe I'm maybe that's wishful thinking on my part.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.160]   You have a point, Leo. I think that this is a completely separate issue from the harassment issue
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.600]   and I like to think that there are going to be developers who say Twitter does not try it,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.000]   doesn't make any effort to protect its users or doesn't make it take enough of an effort to
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.160]   protect its users. So I'm not going to use its tools. I mean, I wouldn't use 4chan sign in.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.680]   Kind of like that. And I think Twitter must say, gosh, we're turning into 4chan. Don't you think?
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.040]   God, if they're paying attention, they must be thinking that the brand is affected. Yes.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.400]   How long before the voice says, gosh, we cannot use these Twitter hashtags anymore
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:51.280]   because our fans are going to Twitter and are going.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:01:01.040]   I don't know. I wonder. I wonder if it's if we are a small community of people who are sort of
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:06.080]   tuned into this happening. I mean, how many people are, you know, friends with an indie game developer
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.560]   who got, you know, driven from our home for threats? Like, I don't think I don't think that many.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:15.280]   And Game Brigade at this point is so convoluted. And we haven't talked about it, but it's,
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:21.520]   you know, it's tough to understand that's been did an article, which is a sports blog. And, you
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.120]   know, a friend of mine was like, who's a big sportsman was like, this Game Brigade thing.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.720]   What? What the hell? And it was a company. And it's, you know, 10,000 word article explaining.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.800]   I mean, I wonder, you know, it's a big deal to me. And it's a big deal to us because we care
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.960]   about these things. But I wonder if it really is it? I mean, does Twitter really know how bad it
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.400]   is? I don't know. I mean, they haven't they haven't even verified Anita Sarkeesian's Twitter account.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:53.040]   She's got she's got tons and tons of accounts that are clearly impersonating her. You know,
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.880]   you know, ripping her profile and her cover photo. And like the whole reason why verification exists
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.880]   is to is to address the and they're not even doing that. And they're not even doing that.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.600]   And it doesn't do any good when you when you look at the imposter site and what do you
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.880]   expect it to do to do to do a background research on on all these Twitter accounts to find the right
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:17.520]   one? The green check doesn't mean crap. Right. I just feel like if if a normal person,
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.840]   first of all, no normal people probably don't use my mom isn't going to use Twitter. But let's
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.600]   say my mom goes to Twitter.com signs up. And of course, Twitter does its best to do the intake
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.720]   and give her some interesting stuff to follow. But she starts seeing streams and maybe she
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.120]   starts following people. It doesn't take very long before even okay, maybe it's not even offensive.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:49.280]   It's just chaotic. And it's a it's a strange culture. It's not a it's weird. Right. And there's
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:55.440]   weird abbreviations. It's just it feels like a little bit wide wide wide wide. It's still tiny
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.680]   and all that. But why why does every weather person in America push their Twitter stuff?
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:05.680]   Why do all these big shows push Twitter? But tell me why has it not taken off more than
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.080]   that? You tell me why? Why are they all using hashtags? Why does every show use a hashtag?
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.840]   And Twitter is not mass. Yeah, but that's why I'm wondering why. I don't know why. I'm
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:21.360]   agreeing with you. Here's here's my bottom line. Chad's gonna tell us why because he's under 50.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.520]   There's no other service that that does that real time public posting. Well, that's why I think
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.640]   that's why I think it's important because Twitter recognizes that it does have a lock on a certain
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:39.760]   market. And what it's looking at is better ways to provide that service for individual communities
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.720]   that will be more appealing to communities that will eliminate the heat it's getting from things
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:50.160]   like game or game. That's why I think fabric would make sense as a strategic shift for Twitter.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.760]   And who knows what they've been what they're doing. Here's my issue with my
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:00.080]   understanding of what they're up to. But it's like IRC. What if every what if people wander into an
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.040]   IRC channel? Not ours is pretty well protected. We have lots of mods up and just a normal IRC
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.840]   channel. That's what if you're on a wonder order Reddit or a fortune or Reddit or fortune? Yeah,
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.600]   exactly. So if you're trying to be a mainstream business and a pre get the approval and appreciation
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.760]   of Wall Street, you you gotta start thinking about how do we present better?
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:28.240]   Okay, but this goes back to our email discussion in Leo. So then Twitter has two options. One,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:34.640]   which they avoided until the ISIS videos would be to try to censor the content. Government's
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.720]   trying to make them do that and so on. So more than nearly impossible. You cannot stay ahead of
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:47.120]   it. But maybe they do in which case it's no longer an open platform. It's no longer an open stream.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:53.120]   Ferguson might not bubble up anymore. Governments can control it more. Which is Twitter. Is it open
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.040]   in which case if it's open? This is the discussion we've had. I think it inevitably
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:04.400]   fosters incivility and trolls. If it's not open, then it's not Twitter. It's not as useful.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:11.440]   That's the Hobson's choice they have. Google announced its financial results for the quarter
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:19.680]   ending September 30th revenue up 20% year over year, 16 and a half billion dollars.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:28.480]   Let's see net income. 2.81 billion. It's nice. Three months you make almost a billion a month.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:36.000]   That's good. That's a good business. It's a nice little business. The Motorola stuff,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.560]   the sale to Lenovo kind of messes things up a little bit. I don't know when they're going to
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:50.560]   close that. They entered that agreement. Believe it or not in January. There is a charge of $378 million
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:57.840]   related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with Motorola. They're writing off
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:08.240]   the patent library. Anything else? I'm looking at international revenues. 9.55 billion. More than
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:20.720]   half of all revenues outside of the United States. Cue the tax battle. They actually broke out their
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.760]   United Kingdom revenues because that's the Irish, the double Irish. And they said 10% of total
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:31.200]   revenues went to the UK. What they did for those who have not been following this story, they set
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:37.440]   up a subsidiary in Ireland that they licensed the search technology to them. They collect the
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.960]   search revenues. But then none of the money gets taxed in Ireland and then gets transferred to
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.560]   the Canary Islands or somewhere Bermuda.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:55.600]   Cost per click went down to completely legal for now.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.840]   Cost per click went down 2%. That's the big issue. They're making less money on banner ads.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:10.240]   However, aggregate paid clicks, which included clicks related ads served on Google sites and
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.040]   sites of network members increased 17%. So the cost went down, but so many more clicks, they made
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:19.680]   more money. But is there a loanage to that volume? Yeah, interesting.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.600]   There's a post that somebody sent us in Twitter that I put up on the bottom of the Google section
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:34.080]   on the rundown asking whether what's the phrase I want. We've hit me. Where'd he go?
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:42.960]   Pete Google. Yeah. You mean it's all downhill from here? Is that what they're saying?
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.120]   Thompson, he's going to be on Twitter on Sunday. We'll ask him about it.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:54.720]   I think, for example, he's arguing that mobile is now bigger than Google's web and it's mobile.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:00.880]   But Google, I think, is conquering mobile as well as anyone. You also argue in native advertising,
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.320]   takes over search advertising. I don't think native advertising joins the world.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.480]   It takes over the world because I think it's a fake on users. I think that attention,
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:16.320]   according to chart to Pete, is where we go. I think relationships is where we go.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:22.080]   But Google's not invincible and Google knows it. Well, in a way, what he's saying is web search,
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:28.800]   which was Google's business, is going to be replaced. Yeah, but Google already is a mobile
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:35.040]   company. Google already is the best at generating signals. Google is a personal services company.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.880]   So I think it's a little simplistic to say they were a search company still. I haven't
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.840]   been a search company in years. I think it's no accident that you've seen on the World Series,
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.080]   and the playoffs, and everywhere else adds for Android for the first time ever.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.160]   Not for a Google phone or a Google device, not for Chrome, not for search for Android.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.680]   I think Google knows the future is mobile. I think they have a pretty,
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.120]   you know, I hate to say it, but I think they were a pretty credible thing they're going with
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:09.760]   that Android. I think that Android going somewhere. Yeah. Just my guess. I don't know.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.360]   Well, ask Ben. That's good. That's an interesting little good issue.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.560]   Yeah. And his blog post is sponsored.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:23.760]   So there you go. Well, a man drill, actually, but it's not a banner ad. It looks integrated
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:30.160]   into his blog name. So yeah, I think we've talked about native advertising and you're
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:37.360]   you talked. We've talked about how it's came to be confusing to the reader, the viewer, the listener.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.520]   But I think that a lot of people really think native advertising is the best thing, right?
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.120]   Because it tricks people. It's so effective.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:52.400]   It's so effective. You know, the best thing is fooling people. We find ads work so much better
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.200]   when they look like editorial. I was at the New York Times today with the Burda editors,
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.400]   and they showed off a lot of the native advertising we've seen. We've talked about the
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.600]   oranges and new black and so on and so forth. And finally, you know, it dawns me what it's about
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:11.200]   is that is the native advertising, besides selling some of your brand value to your advertisers and
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.560]   letting readers think that this is appearing on your site, even though they put labels up.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.200]   That's the real goal in one hand. The other hand is that advertising has been Google's
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:25.040]   part of this completely and absolutely commodified. So you have to sell something special to an
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.200]   advertiser. You got a few choices. You could sell them your special relationship with your users,
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.800]   but you don't have such a thing. Google does, but you don't media because everybody's the same.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.600]   It's a mass. Or you can sell them special content that we made for you, aren't we nice?
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:44.480]   And so it's an effort to de-commodify advertising, but it's expensive. It doesn't perform that well.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:50.720]   Chartbeat has also found that people scroll three quarters of the time with real content,
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.080]   only one quarter of the time when they hit native advertising. So they know, people intuitively
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:00.640]   know they're reading crap. Exactly. And yeah, is it possible to do native advertising that
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.720]   has an interesting piece? Yeah. But if people won't read a four word banner ad, why do we think
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.400]   it's going to read a 600 word native? Only if they don't know it's an ad.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:14.080]   Yeah. If they think it's content, they might go, it's an ad. Then is it an ad?
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.600]   What you said, Orange is the new black. That's native content. Is it brought to
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.880]   go by the color orange? The New York, look and look on up. The New York Times did a
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:31.920]   native story about women in prison. Oh, Jesus. Peg to Netflix. And by the way,
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.560]   if you'd like to learn more about women in prison, there's a fabulous show on Netflix.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:45.600]   Oh, God. It was well done. Look at this. It says paid post. Just those of you who are watching
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.720]   at home, see if you can figure out where it says paid post. It says it right? Well, it's obvious.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.920]   It's right here in this little bay light blue. There it is.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.160]   Well, but Leo, it also uses a sans serif type. Is that enough of it?
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.880]   There it is. It's obviously a paid post. Oh, I like.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:10.480]   Like, who wrote this? Did the Times write this piece? No, the time a business side writer wrote
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.640]   this. It's very well done. It's like got all that fancy new media stuff that New York Times.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.720]   The videos are good. The interviews are good. I mean, it's well done. But if you're a reader
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.320]   of the Times, you have to ask, Hmm, if this story is so good, why didn't editorial do it?
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.600]   In August op ed in the New York Times, Piper Kerman, author of the prison memoir,
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:37.040]   Orange is a new black, which inspired the Netflix series of the same name, calls the distance between
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:44.000]   boy, that's just horrible, horrible. That that is being argued over and over and over
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.920]   industry is the future. Now, Leo, of course, they'll say, well, it's no different from you,
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:53.840]   reading the spot. Well, we say here comes an ad. There goes an ad and that ends the relationship
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.360]   with the advertiser. They don't doesn't bleed into editorial. I agree. But but but that's the
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.560]   model is it's it's like, you know, you you try to say it looks compatible with the environment.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.000]   Look, it's the Times brand studio that did it. Like here, I mean, it's it's I mean,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.400]   for a web perspective that the the images as you scroll and stuff is really beautifully done
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.240]   because they can afford to because they can afford to do it because Netflix gave them a million bucks.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.680]   Check the URL.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:30.080]   URL is paid post dot New York Times dot com slash Netflix. Okay, they make no bones about that,
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.680]   but who reads that? Yeah, you're trying to put signals out to make sure that there's some
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.600]   caveat at the bottom of the story. It's funny because Apple in its Safari browser would cut
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.800]   that all out except for the New York Times part. But okay, some domain. What's some domain?
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.960]   Yeah, just some domain. It's on the time. It's got a fours. Of course, Forbes has made
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:54.240]   entire business of what they call brand voice. So yes, when we've talked about that for so this
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:00.560]   is though for the most part, except for that paragraph I read good content. Yeah, that actually
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:06.080]   is. So the content's there. So it's almost this is although there's here's I mean,
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.440]   is this a clip from the show orange or is this no these are interview? These are real people.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.080]   It looks like a clip from the show. Yeah, they went they went and spent a lot of
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.120]   there's the other they spent a lot of money to make this down there. Of course, they charged
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.360]   a sponsor for all that money. Yeah, I think it's strengthened my cat does this made me a better
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:30.000]   person being in this does this make you watch the show? And is this and is this in some way deceptive?
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.440]   I mean, the if you know, if the editorial content were were slanted
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.760]   somehow to the only thing is that they have this they have this segment that is
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.320]   Piper Kerman, the author of oranges and then black.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.360]   Right. And then they move on and she was in women's prison. I mean, it's not like she doesn't
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:56.320]   have some standing. They showed another one from United about United taking all of the athletes
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.960]   to the Olympics. And they said United has some data about this that only United has.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.800]   Right. But there's only United has. We're just helping them tell their story.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.560]   Now, how does this appear? The other question would be how would I get to this?
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.840]   Does this appear as a story in their story? In in there's there's there's there's there's a
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.280]   if you go to the home page of the New York Times, yeah, right underneath the whole big
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.240]   main news there's there's a there's a coaster of I don't know a half dozen boxes across
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:28.480]   scroll down scroll down and tell you to stop. I'll keep going stop. Right. Stop in that inside
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.120]   and white times.com. If there was one there isn't right now they would have it in there and
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:38.480]   it would be one of these post post and it would be there and it would say paid post.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:46.480]   Yeah. And they'll they'll sell ads. I believe they'll sell ads on the times to drive traffic to
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:53.120]   the post. So they're selling media and that's I mean, I have to say this is it's hard to find
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:16:01.920]   who's damaged by this. Yeah, I mean, I'm somehow not really offended by that because it's like,
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:08.320]   you know, you know, the show actually is about trying to raise awareness and trying to create
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:12.240]   prison reform. People care about this now. This actually looks like a well researched article
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.280]   with great great assets like does that hurt anyone? I mean, it offends me when it's done really badly.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.640]   But you know, it's the same thing. I think it's fine as long as you know, if the reader knows
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.960]   what and what we need more research and I think they're doing that research now I asked today and
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:32.400]   the industry needs to on whether readers are indeed fooled. Now, if you listen to, I fear that they
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.160]   were, but if you listen to chart beat, they say, well, actually, no people recognize this crap
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:40.000]   but they don't scroll. Well, that might be when it's really crap. This is well done content.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.360]   Well done. I have to say, I would feel a lot better at it about it. If this paid post indicator
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.320]   were a little bit more obvious. I agree. I agree. That is very hidden on the whole thing.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.320]   Well, here's the scary part. Well, it's competing with a giant, you know, header image there.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:03.200]   Yeah. The interactive advertising bureau and Edelman did some research that I hosted their
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.760]   announcement of it or panel at their announcement of it two months ago or so. And what they found
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.400]   was that in entertainment sites and lifestyle sites, people pretty much knew the difference.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.640]   They could give it a site. They could say, that's an ad. That's not that's an ad. That's not.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.120]   They had they could do it only half as well on news sites. This looks like a
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.280]   news. So everybody's seen this. I mean, for crying out loud, my local paper has had a paid
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:34.880]   real estate section as long as I've been alive where, you know, your local realtor writes a column
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.360]   on why it's a good time to buy a house and the auto section. And the yeah, so they I mean,
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.720]   we know I mean, this is not new. No, here's the issue. Here's the issue. And the example I gave
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:50.160]   we discussed Forbes when I see a Forbes link on Twitter now, it could be excellent content by a
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.320]   Forbes staffer and they have really good stuff. It could be it could be very good content by a
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.200]   Forbes contributor. It could be crappy content by a Forbes contributor or it could be a really long
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.840]   and wordy ad. I don't know which it is where I click. And when I get there, I see something
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.680]   labeled brand voice. And next to that, it says, what's this? Well, if you have to put a link to say,
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.240]   what's this? Obviously the link, the label link, good and right. So in the long run, I think that
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:21.040]   publishers risk their their brands, their trust, their equity. Well, I wouldn't do it. But more,
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:26.000]   that's more because I'm old, funny, daddy. But now what happens is the Times has to say,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.040]   the Times puts itself in a position where they will and they are there they reject
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:35.200]   ideas for native ads. They won't do them. They have to hold them to a standard. Good. I heard
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.760]   another publisher this week say that the editorial staff is asking the ad departments to do better
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.560]   native advertising. So it holds up. But at some point, what that says is, it's being seen as part
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.000]   of your brand. And so you become responsible if you're advertising in a way you worked before.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.240]   All I'm suggesting is it's not the future of all advertising because I can't see consumers
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:04.720]   reading thousand word pieces and just getting the subliminal message that I feel like watching
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:13.520]   some women in prison. We have the Google change log coming up in just a little bit, but first
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:23.920]   an ad from our friends. I don't know what the difference is. Have you listened to Alex Bloomberg's
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.800]   podcast about making a podcast company? No, I have to listen to that. You really have to. And the
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.480]   funny thing is he goes out of his way to this and he plays special little music when he goes into
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.080]   the ad and he explains that's how you know I'm in the ad. I'm going to explain this to you.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.760]   But you will want people to listen to that. And I'm sorry I'm doing this now over the
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.800]   or should I should actually Paul Harvey used to do that. He got page two. And unless you were in
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:50.240]   the clue, you didn't know, but that's what that meant is this isn't ad. I mean, I think always
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:55.520]   it's always the case that when hosts read ads, there's a little bit of one of the reasons they
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.360]   want host red ads is a little bit of confusion. Or no, it's just no, it's just you can't escape it.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:06.880]   It's part of the flow. Yeah. All right. I don't know. I, you know, I wish I didn't have to make money.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:11.200]   I wish I were independently wealthy and I could just do this whole thing. If you wait, wait, wait,
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.160]   if you were independently wealthy, would you really be doing working as hard as you were in?
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.440]   Well, I wouldn't be doing three or four shows a day. No, but I know.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:26.320]   But I might do one show a day just in a leisurely fashion in my jammies. Yes. I like doing it.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:32.720]   It's not that I don't love doing these shows. Yeah. And I, but I wish I, you know, we employ 20
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.600]   people full-time staff and another several dozen hosts like you guys. We pay you guys to be here.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.000]   Not a huge amount, but you get something and all that money comes from advertising. It's the only
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.560]   source of revenue. We get a little bit of money from people who donate. Thank you donors,
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.000]   but really mostly it's from advertising. And so we, that's how it works. But I,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.440]   you know, if I had a couple hundred million, if I were Steve Bummer, I might just do this for fun.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:00.880]   Pay you guys. I told Kevin Rose really basically I'd pay to have some friends.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:11.440]   Otherwise I'd be lonely. Our show today brought to you by SmartThings. And this was a Kickstarter
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.880]   project. In fact, Gina told me that she actually invested in it. The whole idea of which was to
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.960]   solve the problem of how to automate your home. There's like all these different protocols.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:25.920]   Nobody talks to anybody else. So the smart folks at SmartThings said, what if we made a hub that
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.920]   talked to everything? And then you wouldn't need to worry about it. You just put the hub in your,
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.600]   your home, connect it to the internet and then start getting little solution kits or security
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:43.280]   kits and adding features. They have all sorts of do hickeys that work with the SmartThings. And
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:48.640]   then the SmartThings Hub also works with other companies stuff like the Sonos, which I love,
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.840]   the WeMo from Belkins. Those great LED lights from Philips the Hue, the Dropcam. We use those
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:22:01.600]   Nest thermostats or Eon or Honeywell or Schlage Locks or GE. So this way you've got kind of this
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:06.960]   infinite capability of stitching things together. You can use if this than that. If you want to
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.120]   have, you know, kind of, you can even write little programs in effect that connect these.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.000]   SmartThings has three home, SmartHome security kits because that's one of the things people first
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.320]   want to do. They came up with those right away. You get the hub plus devices to know if there's
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.800]   motion in your home or if somebody's open to door, that kind of thing. They've also got something new,
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.280]   which I really like. These are the solution kits. There's four of them and they help you
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.880]   achieve common goals like automating lights or saving energy or protecting your home from leaks,
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.520]   that kind of thing. Oh, and if you're an Arduino maker, there's a maker kit that will let you
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:47.520]   connect your Arduino projects. Now the sky is really the limit. Every kit starts with a SmartThings
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.800]   hub and then has the sensors and devices you'll need to turn your home into a SmartHome in,
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.960]   you know, as little as 15 minutes, including the new improved updates to the SmartThings
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:03.120]   Zigbee sensors. Zigbee's a very common home automation protocol and they do Zigbee better than
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:08.400]   anybody now. But the really powerful thing about SmartThings, it's an open platform. That means
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.800]   because it's compatible with hundreds of devices, there are thousands of things you can do with
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.880]   this product. They have an iOS and Android app, one lap, one app, limitless possibilities.

[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:54.160]   I said, I'm not exactly handy and I was able to set these up and make them work with my
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:01.760]   hue lights and the wemo and Sony. I love my Sonos. Sonos welcomes me home with hail to the chief
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:09.360]   every time I go. It's so nice. Wouldn't that be great? I should do that actually.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:17.840]   All right. Speaking of trumpets, it's time for the change log. Play those trumpets.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:21.520]   The Google change log.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:29.600]   And now ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani with the newest stuff from Google.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:36.160]   Google Play music adds songs says, can you hear me okay? Yeah, you can.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.360]   Yes, I'm just making funny faces. Just making funny faces. Okay, good.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:46.960]   Google Play music adds songs as contextual playlists for all access subscribers and using the new
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.920]   material design UI, which we're going to see a lot of in the change log in the coming weeks.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:57.760]   So that means if you're a Google Play music, all access subscriber in Google Play music on
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:04.320]   Android iOS and on the web, you'll see a brand new section in the listen now area. That's basically
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.680]   a take on songs as concierge functionality. So depending on what time of day it is or what
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:15.120]   you're likely to be doing at the moment, play music will show you a list of possible sort of
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.360]   playlists or stations you'll want to listen to like working out, getting ready for work,
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.640]   studying, sleeping, you know, hey, it's Wednesday afternoon. Do you want some, you know, you want
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.840]   to work to the beat? You want to boost your energy? Do you want to relax? And it offers you kind of
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:36.000]   a list of a playlist. I've been playing with this today. It's pretty great. I got to say, look at
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   that the blog 50. I like that read all the music blog, all the music blog songs that you want.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.640]   I got to say I'm a huge fan of Google Play music and I have all access and when I saw this come in,
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:54.160]   I was so excited because it's discovering music is the best thing to do when you have unlimited music
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.480]   and this makes it very simple. Yeah, it's pretty, it's really, really great. I mean,
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.600]   and you know, we were looking at this last night on all about Android. It was so funny. You know,
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.840]   Jason has young kids like me and he had, you know, family and toddler tunes, you know, and Ron is,
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:11.840]   is a, you know, single guy hangs out with his friends and all of his suggestions for a Tuesday
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.760]   night or like going out to dinner, hanging with your friends. Like, you know, we were saying,
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:19.920]   we were commenting how scary it was that it knew so much about our lives. If you look at mine,
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.280]   it has working to the beat, having fun at work, boost your energy. It seems like I work too much.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:31.040]   But that's the songs of stuff. It always had stuff like that. Right. Yeah. Right. Right.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:36.000]   But it knows, so it knows what time of day it is, what you're likely to be doing based on,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.120]   you know, earlier choices. It's all about it. Basically Google now for music. So it's pretty
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:45.600]   great. They bought songs a while ago. This is they just started integrating it. They just started
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.960]   integrating it. I love Google Play music. The more I use it, the more I love it.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.520]   I have to say this really, this feature really, yeah, I was thinking of my all access subscription.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:59.200]   I like it. I was thinking about maybe canceling this on in. I'm good. I know there's now Spotify
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:03.440]   and Beats looks more and more interesting. You got a lot of choices. There are a lot of choices
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:09.840]   out there. It's true. It's true. This one, Leo, I think you, I wonder if you, he must have talked
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:16.720]   about this with, with Steve, Google beefs up. It's two step verification with a physical USB
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:23.680]   security key option in Chrome. So it's, so basically this is a second, you know, two-factor authentication,
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.240]   of course, is your password. But then this other thing that you have, a physical thing that you have.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.960]   Normally it's your phone, you know, you get your authorization code on your phone or via SMS.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.120]   This is an actual USB key that supports a bit of a standard for this kind of authentication
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:43.680]   that you can plug in with this enabled in Chrome. You plug into your computer and Chrome knows,
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.120]   yes, this is you. Ah, you have one. This is from you, they've made these keys for a while.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.760]   And there's, there's, this is Neo. These, is it Fido that Google is supporting?
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.040]   I know Fido. Yeah, I ordered one yesterday when they announced this.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.600]   Yeah. So this is the Neo. This, this, the idea is you leave this in your USB port
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.960]   and it just checks it. I worry about this because I was afraid afraid of losing my dongle.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.040]   Right. Right. And the,
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:13.840]   there was like, for you, Gina, does your phone still work with, because even phone doesn't have a USB.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.960]   Right. This, it's a good question. I haven't, I haven't actually tried this myself. Leo,
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.600]   do you know, does the phone still work or is that so that the USB is just for your computer and
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.520]   do I need one for each individual device? Well, you can't. Well, you could. I mean, both of these have
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:32.320]   little, little holes that you could put it on a lanyard or something and carry it around your device
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:37.360]   with you. In case you want to put it into a work computer and then leave or someplace else in
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.040]   the lead. Right. But then what about when you're on the road could, would authenticator still work?
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.120]   I don't know. I would love it if it did. And I don't, and I just don't know.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:49.360]   When I, when I spoke to the work, people, um, uh, uh, ahead of, of,
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:54.960]   wait a minute, let me look, look, look, it says use a verification code instead right there on the,
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.160]   on the verification screen. So that means you could either have your security key in there or
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.760]   or go to your, your, go to your authenticator and use the code.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.520]   Right. And, and they were, and they were, they had a security to give a fascinating talk. And he said,
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:12.080]   yeah, we acknowledge that not many people use two step and he said, we'll soon have something.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:17.040]   I presume this is it that they thought we'll get more people to use it. My guess is that you get to
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:22.960]   tell me if I'm wrong, NFC on your phone operates in essence like that. It says I'm me. And I can
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:28.720]   see Google doing other hardware things that will help us besides having a wonky USB device.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:33.200]   Oh yeah. Thank, thank you, Dr. Mom. Dr. Mom just said in the chat room that the key has NFC. So you
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:38.160]   can use it with your phone. This one does this one doesn't right. Okay, so some do some don't.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.040]   Oh, that's why they get some price because they go from four bucks to 50 bucks. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:46.960]   The little one does not it's too small. And the big one does.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.720]   But there's more than that. I mean, so these are from Yuba Key, a Yuba co you,
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:58.160]   why you be I co and we like them. Now how does that work? Does that just have one special number?
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.240]   And it says I'm a hardware thing. So you know, I'm really really, no, it actually has a processor
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:08.000]   in here and does calculations. So it gets queried. But it's my understanding. Steve did talk about
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.960]   this on Tuesday. But I was sleeping. It gets queried. I was trying to pay attention. I didn't
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.800]   understand it. That's the problem. It gets queried and makes some calculations and comes back with
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:24.640]   a response, I believe, or is used by the computer to do the calculations. So there is a processor
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:30.720]   in this, believe it or not. Oh, yeah, it's now wild. What if you lose it or it breaks?
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.920]   Well, that's that's the point is then you use your verification.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.040]   Off the off the right. I'll tell you what, before next week, I will set this up and start using it.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:45.680]   Sweet. We got you on inbox. We got, you know, I am sad. I have one arriving from Amazon,
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:49.120]   like tomorrow. So I'm going to try it to. Okay, good. Sweet. Cool.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:56.240]   Change log. What else we got? Oh, Google Earth for Android. Got a new got got some updates,
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:02.960]   including new 3D rendering technology, faster updates and some KML updates. So first,
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.040]   we got the new 3D technology. This gives users this is Google Earth for Android.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:11.840]   Faster, smoother, crisper transitions is you zooming around to your destination. And Google
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:16.160]   says is the first major 3D overhaul since Earth launched. It's more than 10 years ago now.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:23.360]   Can't believe Earth is so old. Old user. What's that? You use Earth?
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.360]   You know, I haven't. I haven't because Earth was kind of slow. Maps replaced it.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.760]   Yeah. I mean, maps kind of replaced it. So I think they're trying to make Earth relevant again
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:40.080]   with this update. This update, it comes with it's going to get updated faster. Google says,
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.720]   Google said the new Earth update, the new Earth app will get updates at the same time as Google
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:50.560]   Maps to add access to the most up to date information for things like place names, roads and businesses.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:55.600]   So I might spend a little bit more time with it if it's faster and you know, Earth to me was always,
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:01.280]   hey, I want to fly around and like explore, or as maps was always, I need to get somewhere,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.600]   tell me how to do it. Right. So it was more of a utility than anything else.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:13.040]   The new Earth updates also introduces support for opening KML files for custom maps directly from
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.520]   Google Drive. So that's kind of nice. You can store your KML and Google Drive and open them up in
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:26.000]   the new Earth app for Android. Finally, Google Play Games added new nearby multiplayer capabilities
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.040]   to make it easier to play with your friends nearby. So this is part, this is actually for
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:36.320]   developers. This is a part of the Google Play Games API and it lets developers more easily
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:40.000]   create like synchronized challenges. You know, if Jeff and I are in the same room, I can challenge
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.400]   them to a game and sync up players at the same time. And it's similar to the functionality on the
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:51.200]   Nintendo 3DS. So hoping to see more nearby game playing come to your favorite games on Android
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:57.200]   soon. And that's all I got. That, my friends, if you'll play the drums slowly, is our Google.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:08.240]   In the chat room, cool breeze, no cool breeze. Who was it? Somebody breeze, cool breeze. Just put
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.520]   up a link to Yubike comparisons of features. Yes, they have all the different kinds of
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:20.000]   those who want to see. What did you buy, Jeff? You didn't get a Yubike? I don't even remember.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:28.320]   I don't know what one it bought. So what I have is the Neo and so you want something that sports
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:34.880]   U2F. That's the Fido technology. Now you can tell me. Well, I got Fido. I got Fido. You got Fido.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.880]   You got Fido. You're good. And so the blue one that I showed is a Fido touch key. And then the
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.640]   Neo and which is so the final touch key, even though it's bigger is $18 and the Neo and is $60,
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.640]   that's touch one time password generator, smart card. And it supports other protocols like Java
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.240]   card and so forth. There's a lot of protocols. Google points out that the reason you'd want to do
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:05.520]   this is you can't get spoofed by a fisher who might grab your text messages somehow and get the
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:10.000]   authentication code. Or I mean, if you have it on your phone as authenticator, I think you're
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:17.040]   probably okay. I bet you businesses would like this because you could give, you know, you could
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.960]   say, all right, this is your Chrome. This is your laptop. This is your chip. Put that in there.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.400]   Only you can use it. Take the chip home with you or something like that, right?
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:32.080]   A physical unit. Hand in your chip, Mr. Yeah, hand in your chip. Exactly. Business likes hand in
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:37.600]   your chip. So and it Yeah, if you yeah, so that's a good page. It shows you all the different kinds
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:42.560]   of stuff. Do you guys know how if you lose your phone, you're okay. If you lose your chip, you're
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:47.840]   okay. If you lose both your screwed. Yeah, I guess, but it gives you more. You know what I do. You
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.280]   know what I do. I put the so the way you get authenticator to work. And by the way, this is a
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.800]   standard. It's not just Google's. And there are other companies that make authenticator
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.760]   included authenticator apps, including Microsoft. But the way all these apps work is they need
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:08.000]   your secret key, which is issued to you by the pro the company that you're logging into.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.880]   Most of the time they do that in a QR code, right? And so the authenticator lets you take a picture
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.320]   of the QR codes. You'd have to enter in this 30 digit key. And then that says, oh, yeah, that came
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:25.120]   from, you know, last pass. And that's this. And so I'm going to now start generating numbers
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:30.880]   based on that secret key. The secret key, the number is a hat is some hash of the secret key
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:39.760]   in the time. And the reason that that works is because you don't share that secret. So only last
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:46.240]   pass and I know the secret key. We both know roughly what time it is pretty accurately. So the
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.640]   last pass knows based on my secret key hash for the time what number, what six digit number,
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.560]   I'm going to give it if they match, I must be the holder of that secret key. But you know,
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:59.680]   if that secret key leaks out your trouble, what I do is I actually put those QR codes for Google.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:05.760]   I use Google tumbler ever know outlook last pass in my last pass secure store. I take a nice,
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.800]   save the image. So even if I lose my phone, it's only because I use so many phones, right? Every
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:15.520]   time I get a new phone, the first thing I do set up authenticator on that phone. And because I'm
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.360]   using the same QR code, the same secret number each time I get the same numbers on all those
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:27.600]   phones. The industry's got to make all this easier. It's easy. What's so hard? I am. I really like
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.640]   Othi. Othi is a very good one. I've used Othi. Yeah. And I want you and I'm glad you explained
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:38.000]   that Leo because I wondered, I was like, how does Othi know? Right. But so this is just a standard.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.560]   This is a standard and the time stand. But that's why they're time dependent. That's why the clock
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.240]   counts down. That's right. That helps. That helps a lot. Thank you. That's an explanation.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:54.640]   I hope I'm right. Again, I drift off during security now and I may miss the gist of it.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:59.280]   Yeah. Othi is not from Google, but it works. You'll get the same number that Google would give you.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.120]   Right. An authenticator. Yeah. I find Othi just a little nicer looking than
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.480]   I might maybe I'll switch to Othi. I've used it on non Android platforms.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:14.480]   Okay. Hey, anybody order a Nexus nine?
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:22.160]   My phone's my phone tablets are over. They're over. They're not. I just
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:27.360]   this too big for my pocket. I like my seven. Yeah. This giant phone. Oh, you got the seven. Yeah.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.160]   I saw the seven. I don't use it. I haven't used it in ages. I'll use it constantly.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:37.440]   Use it on the train. Is that why? Use it on the train. Train. Yeah. So it's travel.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:40.560]   I'm going to get a lot of. You order six.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:48.160]   October 29th. Apparently the order date I will get up early in the morning to order a six.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.520]   I've bought my phones this year. I want to. I've bought too many phones. I've been through two
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:58.400]   HEC ones and now I got the one plus. I can't. I just can't justify. And honestly, it's a little
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:05.360]   too big for me. It's really big. Six inches. Yeah. They're going to still sell the Nexus five.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.280]   I thought that was interesting. So it's pretty clear what the strategy and we hypothesize this
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:15.840]   lack weight last week. The strategy is the developer platform, the cheap, you know, lollipop phone
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:22.080]   will be Nexus five and Google's actually going to sell the Nexus six as a real feature phone through
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:29.680]   all the carriers and all of that at a steep price. Yeah. 600. I'm ready to buy. It looks like a
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.720]   I'm not clear. It looks like it does everything the Moto X does. Does it do the always listening and
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:40.640]   the does? Yeah. It does. You can. It does. It does the one plus one thing where you can tap the
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:45.440]   screen and it turns on. I saw that that's lollipop. Yeah. Lollipop lets you tap the screen.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.880]   You know, this was I was saying this on all about Android last night and you said last week you
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:55.520]   think cyanogen is the best Android. I'm I'm really surprised and you know, it was so interesting to
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:02.160]   me how many features that are in cyanogen made that made it into lollipop. Like clearly cyanogen
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:07.440]   is this like bleeding edge thing and and Google's paying attention or they're mind-melting. I don't
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.400]   know what they're doing, but it just it seems like there are just certain features and I'm like, oh,
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.640]   yeah, that's already in cyanogen. And now that that's going to be part of the default. It's nice.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:19.840]   I still think the one plus one is great. I gave mine to the to the Catholic Church. So I don't have
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:28.240]   to use it anymore. Um, actually, yeah. You're not allowed to give him anything. It's always to
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.480]   the church and then they let him use it. I think I don't know. I said, you want my phone? He said,
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:39.280]   yeah, but I but I do like the one plus. But get you every time those valves are probably nightmare.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:45.680]   Or guy. No, I think he's actually using right now. Next is for which. I mean, no, for which I'll
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.040]   talk about in a second. And then the real question is going to be what happened that this is 5.7
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.760]   inches. The real question is going to be what happens. I have to order an X is six. It's my job.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.800]   It's your job. Yeah. Yeah. Chad, what are you? You're you went iPhone. I want iPhone six rather. Six
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:07.760]   plus. And I am not. I am. You got no regrets? I don't know yet. Miss an android yet. I'm going
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:13.680]   to wait until you get it. I'm worried that six is the half inch that pushes over to it's an inch
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:21.680]   away from the next seven. I mean, extra half inch. So close. Yeah. Although in photos, but just look
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.920]   at the comparison of these two. Yeah. This is a five. I'm not sure it's going to feel that way.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.840]   The the you're right. The seven does have a one plus one, which you're holding up there. That's a
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:38.640]   one plus one, right? That's five and a half inches. That's the same size as as six plus. You said,
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:44.400]   if you made if you guessed, this would look like a, you know, a five to a nine. Yeah. You know,
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.320]   the other thing that's hard to understand like, for instance, this note for which has a bigger screen
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.600]   than your six plus is a smaller phone because they're big bezels. Absolutely. Basically,
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.240]   I am holding out to till you have it in your head. I will bring you the next six. You can look at
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.920]   it and you'll say, I'll take that. Thank you very much. And then I'm hoping that the resell value
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.960]   of the six plus is good enough if I decided to jump ship on iOS. The next is a, has a couple of
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:14.400]   things. It has dual front facing speakers. That's nice. Really nice. Yeah. Out of the features of
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:21.280]   the iPhone that I'll miss, I will so miss Touch ID. Yeah. Touch ID is awesome. And it seems like
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:26.480]   they're doing Apple Pay right with. Well, I believe no, no, wait a minute though. You'll still be able
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:31.680]   to touch and pay with the Nexus six or the note for the no for does in fact have a fingerprint reader,
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:38.880]   which, which works. It's not quite as good as apples, but it gets the job done. Yeah, you have to
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:45.280]   swipe it. And it does mean you have a physical button, which I'm not crazy about, but you swipe
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:52.880]   it. And, and by the way, applications like LastPass use it. So I swipe and it unlocks. So I no longer
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:42:00.080]   have to enter that pin in LastPass or the password. I swipe and unlock. So I wonder how long before
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:05.200]   Google starts doing that, you know, Apple bought the company that it uses authentic. And they seem
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:09.680]   to have the best technology. Samsung is kind of more like those old and oval laptops. You have to
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:16.720]   swipe across it. Anyway, I'm going to talk more about this in my pick of the week. So I don't want
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:22.160]   to preempt to myself. Let's see what else some people are starting to see the Nexus six now, I
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:25.440]   guess, but we won't get to be able to order it to the end of the month. And I'm not sure when it'll
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:29.520]   arrive at that point. I have to say, given the number of people who's saying I'm going to buy
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:35.360]   one, I'm going to buy one and maybe in short supply be prepared. Lollipop, we're starting to see
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:41.280]   some on the 29th. It's no preorder on the 29th. What time of the day will that probably have
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.520]   midnight? I'd come in a login at midnight and every hour thereafter. Good night, California.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:50.240]   I don't know. No, Google is not like Apple. Apple says midnight and then doesn't do it.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.320]   Google doesn't say a time and then just does it whenever they get around to it.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:58.640]   Right? I'm trying to remember pre other preorders. You just kind of have to keep checking.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:02.240]   I'm going to get Madrid. Oh, you want me to buy you one?
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.840]   I might need that. We'll see. Okay, you just tell me and I will buy two if you need to.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:14.800]   I presume I can get two. Blue, they come in midnight blue or moonlight,
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:22.480]   silk white or something like that. I don't want the white. Are you going to buy the 64?
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:27.440]   Oh, yeah. Yes, we'll. You're going to have the most memory. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:30.880]   So we're starting to see more about Lollipop. That's the negative on something like the note
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:37.440]   for and the positive on this Nexus 6 is your guaranteed to have Lollipop faster than anybody
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.520]   else. Yeah, I like that. I think that looks like it looks just like a Moto X on steroids.
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:47.280]   Does swollen up Moto X without the fancy colors and the wood and the bamboo.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:52.480]   The first reviews are also saying the camera is really good. Well, that's what they're saying.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:44:00.000]   Yeah, but remember, they're comparing it to the Nexus 5. So, wow, it looks like the thing I took
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:07.200]   a picture of. Yeah, notice this is this hands on. I'm this is the Verge's hands on.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:13.200]   Peter bone. You don't see any hands. I don't think he I'm wondering. This seems like maybe
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:18.160]   at an event he had a hands on. I don't think he has the phone yet. A whale of a phone. A whale
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.920]   of a phone code named Shamo. This is the ad that you're seeing for it and all that stuff.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:29.440]   I think it looks pretty nice. We'll see. I want Lollipop. Yeah, I do too. They are offering.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.760]   Google's got a little bit of a problem because remember they moved everybody to hangouts,
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:39.680]   but they still have to offer a messenger app. So, they will continue to have a messenger app,
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.240]   a stock SMS app in the Lollipop as well as hangouts.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:53.680]   Which is weird, but they have to. Yeah. There is an opt in kill switch in Lollipop, not
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:45:03.280]   default opt in. The new Gmail 5.0, which as we mentioned, will handle all accounts.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:08.640]   The new Google Play Store 5.0, which is already out for some people. Some people have that.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.760]   Yeah, I don't have it yet. No, I don't either. What else is going to be new?
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:17.040]   You know, this material design. Have you been playing with that at all? I mean,
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:22.320]   you know, I haven't installed the preview images or anything. So, I haven't had a chance. I haven't
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.880]   played with it. I mean, I think it's the biggest, most noticeable change. I think, you know,
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.200]   is that everything's going to look different and but be faster and sort of seems pretty
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.280]   pretty snappy. You see how fast that window's moved on that. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:40.640]   Yeah. Last night we had on the, one of the developers on the, on Tumblr, at Tumblr on
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.960]   their Android app. And he was saying that, you know, on early other versions of Android,
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.840]   Tumblr scroll mechanism was sort of janky, a little bit, you know, stuttery and how they had
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:55.040]   all these internal projects to make it smoother. And they installed the Tumblr app on L and it's
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:00.080]   smooth as butter and they didn't change a thing. So, there's clearly like speed improvements that
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.240]   you get, you know, kind of just just for free. Like it's very, very snappy. Even with all the
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:11.600]   transitions and sliding and effects, it looks really good. Let's hear a page turn on a book.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.760]   Is this Deeter doing that looks like Deeter? Yeah, it is. Yeah. Deeter bone of the version.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:22.000]   I mean, the keyboard looks nice. You got it. They're competing one to one with, with iOS now.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.680]   Yeah. Their design is so tight. Pretty much. And you got it. Yeah. We had Neelai on TNT this
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.120]   morning. Neelai Patel from the Virgin TNT. And he said something I've been saying for a while,
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.800]   which is that iOS is out of date. And they really have it. Apple has not managed to keep up with
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:45.200]   Android and just UI wise, I really feel like Android has, has lapped iOS. So material is really
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.840]   great. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited about it. All right. Let's take a break. When we come back,
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:54.240]   a tool, a tip and a number as we wrap this thing up, our show today brought to you by

[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:20.400]   1014. Oh, there's gorilla video. It's kind of.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:32.240]   Shutterstock.com use the evercode twig 1014. And now Gina Trapani has her tip of the
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:38.240]   week. All right, this is one of those tips that is not news at all, but it's one of those things
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.200]   that isn't obvious and is super handy when you need it. Okay. So when you're in, you're using
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:50.960]   Google Maps navigation on your phone, get somewhere. If you tap the compass, you can toggle
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:59.200]   between first-person view and the route view, which is really, really handy when you want to see,
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.280]   you know, what the entire route is. So and again, non-obvious. I do that all the time because I
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:10.560]   always want to see where the hell you taking me. Where are they taking me? Exactly. Exactly.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:17.760]   When I read this, I was like, Oh, right. Okay. Good to know because it's not. I mean,
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.800]   the compass doesn't exactly ask to be tapped. Right. So next time you're a navigation, tap on the
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:28.720]   compass, you can switch between those two views, both of which are very handy. Nice. Jeff, your
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:32.960]   number of the week. I'm going to cheat a little bit. I'm going to use the first Mark Zuckerberg's
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:38.880]   first interview in Mandarin. He answered in Mandarin answered in Mandarin. I haven't watched
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.480]   the video. You have this video there on the rundown. I just want an overachiever.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:52.560]   Skip ahead to like. I was talking to students in China.
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:51:00.560]   I heard you said, um, it was not good. You're in there.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.400]   They love it when you speak, even if you're terrible.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:11.760]   He actually sounds pretty good. He's got to work on his tones though.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:17.280]   Oh, that's weird.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:24.240]   He said he Chinese in college for years, and I couldn't do this. That's pretty
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:28.800]   amazing. Somebody said in Twitter where I found this, he did this while running the company.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.880]   What did you do? Yeah. And killing and dressing his own meat products.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:43.040]   And tearing down his block. Yeah. I hate overachievers. Wow. That is very impressive.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:49.280]   Chinese is not an easy language. That's great. Good for him. He actually seemed that crowd loved it.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:53.920]   Oh, well, and I got to tell you that Chinese speakers love it when you even if you are
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:52:00.240]   terrible, they go, Oh, your accent is excellent. My favorite moment when I visited China was I
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:05.520]   was walking through a public garden and happened upon what I assume who I assume were locals.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:10.960]   And my group raised our hands and said, Nihao. And they said hello. And then we all just cracked
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:16.480]   up. Like everyone just started laughing. And it was it was fantastic. I like to, I like to, uh,
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:23.120]   you know, go to the, uh, get, get the Manny Petty's. And they're talking in Chinese the whole time.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:30.400]   And at the end, I go, Oh, she's she means I gen and they go, Oh, you can't. You understand.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.280]   I didn't, but I like to pretend. You like to pretend. Oh, no.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:40.400]   That guy, Jen knew what we were saying about him.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:45.840]   So I did a full review of the galaxy. Did you want to do another number, Jeff?
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.600]   No, no, no, that's first is a number. It counts. I've I cheated, but I could, I can go into
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:55.280]   which numbers by animal. That was a good one. I liked seeing Mark Zuckerberg speak Chinese.
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:53:01.120]   This is good. So I did a review, full review of this on before you buy. Um, this is the galaxy
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:05.200]   note for I got the unlocked edition. People are starting to get them now from the major care.
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:10.080]   How much that cost 1000 bucks? Uh, no, not that bad. 850. You're 50. Okay.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:16.240]   You can get it for $300 subsidized in Korea. It was more than a thousand dollars.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:23.040]   Wow. It's beautiful. I mean, this is a 5.7 inch super AMOLED screen running at quad HD.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:30.960]   So it's what 25 60 by 1440. And you can see it. It's, it's really, really gorgeous. Here's the
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:36.880]   inbox app running on it. Texas, Chris. Uh, you can't see any dots at all. I mean,
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:43.040]   it just really is a beautiful phone. Very fast. Quad core processors, 2.7 gigahertz
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:49.120]   quad core processors. I mean, that's, that's desktop speeds now. Um, and the main thing,
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:54.800]   you know, I'm not a fan of what Samsung does to Android or haven't been. I am a fan of the notes
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:59.680]   because I like the giant screens and I've had every note, one, two, three and four and always loved
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:05.440]   it. Huh? You use the pen? Yeah. I mean, the pen works great. I kind of like to have it once in a
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:08.720]   while. Yeah. There's times when you want to take written notes, for instance, that this is,
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:13.920]   this is very handy. They've got templates you can fill in. You can, if you work really hard at it,
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:18.720]   uh, have the handwriting converted into text, but you have to write very nicely on a straight
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.680]   line, which I do not do. Um, it also, as I pointed out, has a fingerprint reader that works
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:31.120]   and can be used for Google Wallet and other things. Um, you could train up to three fingerprints.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.800]   The only thing about the fingerprint reader, you see, it's kind of wide. That's because you're
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:38.720]   scanning your fingerprints. So you have to cover it entirely. You'll learn how to do it pretty good,
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:43.680]   but, uh, it isn't as easy as apples where you just rest your finger on it. Apple seems to work
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:49.280]   every time and this one takes a little practice. Um, but I, the main thing I want to say, and by the
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:52.800]   way, I'm not, I'm running Nova launcher here. I'm not running touch whiz as you probably could tell
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:59.360]   from the normal looking doc, not the touch whiz weird doc. Again, the Samsung is king of
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:05.440]   junk and stuff up in the interface and so forth, but they have obviously listened to people and
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:10.480]   they've jumped it up so much less than, for instance, remember the camera used to have 800,
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:16.240]   uh, different modes. They, they still have, uh, the same number of modes, but they, you can
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.800]   manage them and to hide the modes you don't want to use. Now we were talking about how good the
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:25.600]   camera is going to be on the Nexus six. I think there's no question. This is a 16 megapixel shooter
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:32.080]   that's spectacular. Uh, three megapixel, 3.7, I think megapixel front camera with 120 degrees.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:37.040]   So it's really a great selfie camera. Uh, it hasn't some, some interesting useful modes,
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:42.240]   but you don't have to see them all, which is nice. One of my biggest complaints about, um,
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:49.120]   uh, the galaxy's phones is the S voice, the Samsung voice. They replace Google search voice with,
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:56.720]   uh, it's just, I, I want to use Google. You can. Okay, Google. I'm talking to you. Okay, Google.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.920]   And it does the okay, Google thing. And then every Google Android phone has done that since
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:07.280]   KitKat, you can also, uh, get Google now by pressing and holding. So it's really,
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:13.840]   it's a much pure version of Android that Samsung has done, even on the Galaxy S5.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:21.280]   Which battery battery is massive. And the, I think the biggest argument for these phones is this is
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.040]   one of the few phones still remaining where you could take the cover off, put a new battery. So
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:32.400]   if you have two batteries, it is a 32, 20 milliamp hour battery to begin with. I think is huge. Yeah.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.720]   And, you know, uh, which means it's going to get you through the day. I don't have good battery
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:40.880]   numbers yet because I've only had it for a few days. I like to let the phone settle a little bit
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:45.200]   before I really get battery numbers. But I think it's going to be comparable to the one plus one.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:48.480]   And, you know, for 20 bucks, you get a second battery and you never have to worry again.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:54.000]   And SD card support, you know, the Nexus 6 isn't going to have either of these capabilities. So,
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.960]   um, I, I've always liked the Samsung phones for that reason alone. I can buy an extra battery
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:02.800]   battery. You'd like it more than the Nexus 6? It's possible. We'll see. I'm going to buy an
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.160]   Nexus 6. Nexus 6 doesn't have removal back, doesn't have a stylus. But it has lollipop. This is
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.840]   KitKat. And I don't expect lollipop to show up for a Samsung phone right away by any means.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:19.760]   But again, you put, you put a launcher of your choice on there and it's, I tell you that the
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:24.400]   screen is spectacular. We'll have to see what the Nexus 6 looks like. Nexus 6 has roughly the
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:29.120]   same battery, but it's not replaceable. It doesn't have SD cards. So, you know, you're going to have
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:37.520]   to get 64 gigs internal and hope that that's enough. Um, let's see. Nexus 6 has 3200. This has
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:44.560]   3220. So, they have 20 little milliamp hours better. I'm not saying rush out and get a note for, but
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:49.600]   if you did get a note for, I don't think you should feel left out. This is a pretty nice phone. It is
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:55.360]   a gorgeous phone. And you know, if you show this, uh, show my pocket, Chad, um, it's not that big.
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.640]   We're, you know, it's so funny when the notes first came out, people said, oh my God, that's
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.120]   huge. We're so used to big phones now. I could pocket it. It's not so different. How big is that
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:08.400]   one? It's a little smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus. I don't know the exact dimensions of it, but
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.640]   because they're, you know, it's almost edge to edge on the screen. The bezels aren't as big.
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:16.320]   Crapies back, single back speaker. That's one thing that Nexus 6 will do much better.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:23.040]   Um, so I don't know who's going to win on that one. I said to my Korean hosts, uh, I could
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:27.280]   probably say the world laughed at you for your big phones, but you got the last laugh. I think so.
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:33.760]   I love a big phone and I don't use a tablet. Uh, you, I think you could use this on the train very
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:40.720]   happily. Couple other quick notes as if you have a Samsung phone, you can go to the Samsung store
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:46.400]   and download Nokia's here maps and driving directions. Those are very good. Everybody loves those. And
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:51.920]   they have one advantage over Google maps. You can use them offline. They will download maps
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:57.600]   before you head out the door by state, by city, by country. So you can just use them offline. Also,
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:06.880]   get the Fox app. If you have FX or FX, FX on your TV, because the, uh, the FX now app now has every
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:13.280]   episode of the Simpsons ever, 25 seasons, 522 episodes on your phone.
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:20.320]   Now's a couple of little tips for you. If you're getting on an airplane as I am.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:27.120]   Thank you, Gina, trip Annie. Thank you. Think up.com. Everybody should sign up today for that
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:34.320]   great insights. Twitter insights app. Thank you. Yeah. A lot of fun today. Good show.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.800]   And she's back to blogging on squibbler.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:40.480]   Scribbling.net. Yes. Scribbling.net.
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:47.120]   I'm my writing muscles are pretty rusty, but I just decided that even if it's just a paragraph,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:54.080]   I'm going to publish it. Do keep doing it. Keep doing it. It'll be easier and easier and easier.
[01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:58.960]   Yeah, it gets easier, right? It's a muscle for sure. And I love your writing. So I'm just as a,
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:03.440]   as a leader, I want you to do it. Same with you, Jeff Jarvis. He blogs pretty regularly,
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:06.400]   a buzz machine. He's travels a lot on the line. Twitter's going to ruin me.
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:13.040]   Twitter ruined everything. Twitter is why we can't have nice things. Yeah. Twitter is the problem.
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:19.120]   Jeff is at the city university in New York. We're a bunch of very lucky students get to study
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:24.240]   journalism with him and both of them join us virtually every Wednesday at about 1 p.m.
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:30.000]   Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern time 2000 UTC for this week in Google. If you can't watch live,
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.800]   don't worry about it on demand audio and video is available after the fact with that TV slash twig.
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:40.480]   That's our website or wherever podcasts are aggregated iTunes. Stitcher is a good place.
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:44.720]   We have third party, lovely third party apps for almost every platform, including Roku.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:49.760]   So you can download those and watch. We have a lot of people watching on their big screen TVs and
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.080]   their living room on Roku. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Gina. Thanks, Chad Johnson, our producer. Thanks
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:57.680]   to you for watching and we'll see you next week on Twitter. Bye.
