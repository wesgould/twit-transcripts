[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.360]   This week in Google, wait a minute.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.400]   Let me start the timer.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.680]   How do I start the timer?
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.360]   That's good.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.400]   I'm Leo de Porte.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.880]   And this show will be exactly one hour and 15 minutes long.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.640]   Or somebody-- or heads will lay.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.600]   But not this head.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.920]   This lovely head is Gina Trapani of smartawear.org.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.880]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.520]   Big head, Houdi.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.600]   How's it going?
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.920]   Did I miss the show last week?
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920]   I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.720]   No, I haven't seen you in seven days ago.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.920]   But my heart longs for you Leo too,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.680]   and I'm not on Wednesdays.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.200]   So isn't that?
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.040]   Yeah, I feel good.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.760]   I feel like I'm back here.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.200]   And I love him more than you do me.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.160]   Oh, stop it, you guys.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.720]   No, I love him more than you do.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.760]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.240]   I'll tell you from Buzzmachine.com,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.000]   the author of what would Google do in a brand new book called
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.480]   Public Parts, which you must buy.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.760]   Period, just buy it.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.120]   I'll tell you, I was at an event yesterday.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.360]   I spoke at-- it used to be Webmaster World.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.400]   They now call it PubCon.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.600]   It's four webmasters about marketing and promoting
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.560]   your site and social media SEO, search engine.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.920]   Matt Cutz is speaking there today, I think.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160]   But somebody asked at the end of my talk.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   He said, I listen to Twig.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.320]   I love Twig.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.680]   What do you think the future of Google is?
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.840]   And I said something apparently that really upset
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.320]   the crowd.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.240]   I heard later that there was murmuring.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.640]   I said, I think Google's in trouble because I think search
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280]   is changing so rapidly.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.840]   And the idea of a web page search
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.240]   may not have as much currency going forward.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   And what I talked about is Mike Elgin's contention
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.440]   that Siri will intermediate search.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.520]   And that Apple at least is-- in fact,
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.800]   Mike wrote this great article.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.720]   He said this is what Steve meant when he said
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.440]   to go thermal nuclear on Google, not only taking all the Google
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.600]   apps off of the iPhone, which is in process.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   Apple's bought three mapping companies.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.360]   They're clearly going to do a maps.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   They've already replaced Google Places
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.680]   with Yelp in the series search.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.840]   And he believes-- and I think he's right-- that Siri will
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.960]   ultimately appear on all Apple products,
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.760]   despite Apple's product stations that it won't.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.280]   Recently, yesterday I think somebody at Apple said,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.720]   we have no plans to put Siri on any older devices.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.080]   And we will never put video on an iPod.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.640]   And no one would ever want to read books on a small device,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.480]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.120]   I think that people are going to get conditioned doing their
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.040]   searches, not typing into the browser, but asking Siri.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.320]   And at that point, Apple has reintermediated search.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   We talk about disintermediation, right?
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.760]   The idea that a travel agent no longer makes sense.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.840]   You just go right to the airline, you buy the ticket.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.200]   That's what the internet has been doing all along.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.680]   But Apple's kind of reintermediating, saying, well,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.760]   stand between you and your search engine.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.200]   And we'll decide who to choose.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.520]   We'll let Siri figure out where to find what you want,
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.680]   what it is you're looking for.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.200]   It's even better than that.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.840]   Number one, the whole notion of search becomes antiquated.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.280]   Right.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.480]   You're just asking questions and answers.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.000]   And the notion of a brand to the answer goes away.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.560]   Siri just told you the answer, which Google's been going
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.120]   to too, right?
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.480]   We're going to give you the flight details directly.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.040]   Now, Apple out does that.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.280]   Google, of course, has voice search.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.080]   And I've been using their beta version of that.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.800]   So they have that capability.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.600]   But in order to use it, you have to go to a Google page.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.680]   If you use it on a mobile device, now, really, what this
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.800]   is going to do is make the Android iOS war be an all out
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.760]   shooting match.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.680]   It's not a cold war.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.480]   I mean, Android, of course, will continue to be Google,
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.480]   depending on what I would presume.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.400]   So maybe this is just an Apple only concern.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.640]   But I--
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.040]   Siri doesn't present any Google search results?
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.520]   It will.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640]   If you search the web right now, it will search Google.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.160]   OK.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   OK.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.920]   But there's no reason why it has to.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.080]   And it could use something else.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.560]   And when you-- well, let's put it this way.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.880]   When you say, find me a locksmith, it does not use Google.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.320]   It uses Yelp for the reviews.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   OK.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.960]   Interesting.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.320]   If you say--
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.960]   Can Siri give the best search results without having Google
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.400]   involved?
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.920]   Sure.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.080]   You think using other services like Yelp thing?
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.480]   I think we know that Bing is as good as Google, right?
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.440]   Is it?
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.200]   Is it?
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   I think so.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.560]   It's close enough.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.280]   I don't think the user is going to care that much.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.640]   Well, here's the interesting thing.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.160]   If the answer is audio, that's my point earlier,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.480]   is that there's no Brandon Ball.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.400]   And so does Google sue Apple at that point
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.200]   and get off of Siri?
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.120]   So right now, if you say, for instance,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.640]   how many calories in a bagel it will give you a wolf--
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.240]   a branded wolf from Alpha text box.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.440]   Right.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.160]   But as soon as Siri starts reading the answer back to you.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.600]   Then you don't know who it is.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.680]   Then you don't know who it is.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.040]   And so the notion of a web page for many transactions,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.840]   many exchanges, becomes ridiculous.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.280]   And replacing Google with Microsoft
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.440]   probably isn't something Apple looks, anticipates.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.640]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.960]   It becomes a copyright.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.400]   Does Google-- here's the interesting thing.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.040]   Can they copyright results?
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.680]   Exactly.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.200]   Exactly.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.600]   Is the order of the results a copyrightable event?
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.400]   Probably is.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.480]   But is Google really going to want to do that when people are
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.880]   going to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.920]   You're quoting my headline and you're saying that ain't copyright.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.280]   You're going to try to copyright your--
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.000]   same thing, isn't it?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.320]   So what answer is an answer, man?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.240]   It's just information.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.400]   There's also a open source project
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.840]   that's just posted a ginormous archive of spider searches.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.440]   They say because we can't let Google own all of this.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.240]   So just as there is open street map to replace Google maps
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.640]   and open source street mapping, I
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.240]   wouldn't be surprised to see open source alternatives to Google.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.520]   No, Neil, I think you're ahead of you.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.400]   But I think you're right.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.320]   I mean, you're going to hear what Gina says about this too.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.640]   I, Google fanboy, wrote the book, now what?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   And paperback.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.240]   But Google's at a juncture where they've got to be careful.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.520]   The other question, I think--
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.800]   don't we need to get in this too, but it--
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.320]   but Android on the fire, I was talking to some folks
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.400]   at this conference I was at.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.360]   And they believe that Android becomes badly
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.240]   disintegrated there.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.840]   There's nothing special about it.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.440]   They just used it.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.360]   Google's in an interesting position.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.120]   It's true.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.560]   What do you think?
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.400]   It's true.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.640]   Amazon doesn't have to use Google on fire in Android.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.880]   They don't mention Google.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.080]   They don't say anything about it.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.480]   But I don't know.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.280]   Have we seen the search?
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   Is it going to be a Google search?
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.720]   We haven't seen it yet.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.040]   That's where we haven't.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.960]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.800]   I mean, I still think about Google
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.520]   as the best search results out there.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.720]   I mean, I tried switching out the search engines
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.560]   and it just didn't work.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.840]   And in terms of an open source search engine, yes,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.200]   search engines are becoming easier to build
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.160]   and it's kind of old school, right?
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.720]   Like finding web pages isn't the most important thing anymore.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.880]   That's the point, really.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.840]   That's it.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   It may be that Google continues to be the best way
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.440]   to find a web page.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.880]   Right.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.760]   But you've got two-- you've got a double whammy here
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.800]   from both ends, right?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.600]   From one end, you have-- it's just questions and answers.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.360]   It's not web pages.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.880]   Just give me the damn answer to the question
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.680]   and get what I want, right?
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.320]   And the other whammy is discovery does not
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.920]   come through search or brands.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.600]   It comes through sharing and social.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.120]   The two hit at the same time with Google in the middle.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.920]   What if, for instance, it searched Twitter?
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.200]   And for some search results, that would be better.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.240]   Or a search Facebook.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.400]   Or conditioned, it's search results via Facebook, which
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.000]   is what Bing does, right?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.600]   Well, part of this isn't just search too.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.760]   It's also alerts and things.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.040]   It says, oh, Leo, you care about the story.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.520]   We see it's trending right now.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.920]   Siri is watching up for you.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.720]   Siri becomes the fabled agent of your.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.640]   You know what I really see happening, actually.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.320]   And this is happening a number of ways.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.680]   Is that Apple is moving towards this closed Apple-centric
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   environment where they do all the war.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.640]   They do everything.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.080]   And some people will really like this.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.920]   Some people will prefer it.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.560]   I might prefer it.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.800]   I love Siri.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.200]   So some people might say, hey, this is great, especially
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.480]   on a portable device, which is kind of closed anyway.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.720]   Look, this is great.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.440]   But it's not going to be universal.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.480]   Not everybody's-- maybe not even a majority of people
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.160]   will use this.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.480]   But for those living in the Apple universe,
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.520]   it's Apple, Apple, Apple.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.120]   There's no Google.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.040]   There's no anything else.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.000]   There's Apple.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.320]   And then there'll be the rest of us living somewhere else.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.600]   In some way, you're really saying this--
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.040]   The Wild West and the West.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.640]   The Wild West.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.080]   And what will the consequences be?
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.840]   Security issues.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.600]   Corn.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   Corn.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.480]   For some of us, that's not a consequence.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.360]   That's a benefit.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.800]   Right.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.600]   I think our audience-- clearly, our audience-- and not just
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   for this show, but for all Twitch shows-- is always
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.480]   going to choose The Wild West.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.320]   But we aren't-- that's not who this is aimed at.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.760]   Apple doesn't care about us.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.080]   This is the App Store model, right?
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.720]   Yes.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.400]   The apps that come in here, we present content
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   in a very specific way.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.120]   We have rules about how it can be presented.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.400]   You're saying Siri is like another information delivery
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.320]   mechanism where Apple does the scrubbing--
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.040]   Right.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.440]   --and then she's curating in the editing and says,
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.240]   this is how you will get this information.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.080]   And they can cut out Google from this, right?
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.520]   And the Steve Jobs book didn't-- didn't they
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.320]   talk about how a jobs had approached Google and said,
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.000]   kill Android, and I will give you
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.480]   home screen real estate on iOS?
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.000]   I didn't see that in the book that
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   might have been somewhere else that they could have.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.520]   Maybe somewhere else I'd seen this.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.040]   But he basically offered-- he said,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.920]   I will guarantee a few home screen spots on iOS
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.880]   if you stop doing this.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.320]   And Google was basically like, no.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.880]   So it looks like they're doing the opposite.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.520]   If what you're saying is true, Leo,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.440]   that they're going to cut off Google services from the iOS
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.120]   experience either to get them back for Android
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.160]   or because they feel like they can offer better experience
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.120]   through other services.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.560]   Yeah, here's-- I mean, I think it's pretty clear
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.520]   that as Apple's overall business strategy.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.320]   And I guess the question for this show
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.920]   is, does it matter to Google?
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.520]   Do they care?
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.320]   I mean, is it going to be 10% 20%?
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   I mean, there are 150 million iOS devices.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.280]   But Google-- see, maybe Google was prescient.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.480]   Maybe Google was smart when they said, oh, Android,
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.840]   we've got to save ourselves from this potential future.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.480]   So let's do Android.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.760]   Right, but here's the problem.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.240]   We'll cut form.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:11.720]   Right.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.200]   And they will have their own voice.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.600]   They'll have their own Siri.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.200]   They'll have Gary.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.720]   But--
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.160]   Wouldn't it be funny if they call it Gary?
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.000]   I like that.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.280]   It would be like that.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.380]   Every little gear is any prefer f
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.380]   f
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.240]   It'll be a robot with gears, yeah.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:27.740]   Exactly.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:35.440]   But you're getting the gears of my head going here.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.480]   You can hear the noise.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.840]   Because it's not web versus app.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.920]   Now there's a whole new layer.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.160]   There's a layer that's apart from visual presentation.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.960]   And that's a new app purely.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.560]   But it's a whole new layer.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.640]   They're not saying the whole world's going to become audio.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.080]   It's not going to be.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.720]   And how much share does that take away?
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.000]   And how much does that--
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.440]   And the thing is that Google could have argued
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.480]   that on the iPad, people are going to the browser anyway.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   And on the browser, they'll still serve ads.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.120]   So we're OK.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.080]   But what this really starts to kill is browsers.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.040]   Well, and this ties into a conversation
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.600]   we had earlier on security now because Apple has announced
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.040]   that in March, it's going to require anybody who
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.400]   wants to be on the desktop app store to sandbox their apps.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.200]   So they are going to have very much a tight control of apps
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.280]   as well on the desktop.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.920]   So I don't think it is mobile only.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.880]   I think this is-- Apple wants to control--
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.240]   and it's clear from the book that this is--
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.640]   Apple wants to control end to end.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.840]   They believe that they can give a better user experience.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.400]   Please allow me to issue the important buzz caveat, which
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.280]   is that as I'm declaring three takes over the world,
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.040]   it may not.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.720]   No, that's true.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.240]   It's got to--
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's a bit.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.040]   I'm not saying it's going to happen.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.880]   It's a bit.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.880]   But it is.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.560]   It's something that we really want.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.400]   Ben Parr wrote in Mashable, a very interesting article
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.760]   yesterday.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.640]   Two schools have thought the key difference between Apple
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.000]   and Google.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.120]   He, Ben, is kind of crazily listening to In The Plex
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.800]   and the Steve Jobs biography at the same time.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.440]   Which must be very confusing.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.800]   Throw what would Google do in there?
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.240]   Yeah, really.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.720]   And he says-- and I know that you've observed this also, Jeff,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.440]   that Google is data-driven.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.840]   Everything they do.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.880]   Engineers are king, and they have a deep respect for data.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.400]   And they look at the data before they do anything.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.160]   Apple is design-driven.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.480]   And in fact, doesn't care about the data,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.480]   because Steve always felt like the data is after the fact.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.200]   It's too late by then.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.120]   You can't ask a user what they want.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:50.120]   And so that is, in a way, two different belief systems.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.960]   He says-- this is Ben Parr writing.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.160]   Clearly, no one's school of thought
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:53.440]   is right.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.160]   Apple and Google are both wildly successful
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.200]   and profitable companies that change the world.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.840]   Design-focused companies tackle different kinds of problems
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.200]   than data-focused companies.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.160]   That's true also.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.440]   Design-focused companies like Apple or Flipboard
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.160]   will focus on creating revolutionary never-before-seen
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.360]   products, because of course, data can't predict.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.280]   Data-focused companies like Google
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.280]   have a better chance at revolutionizing existing markets,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.520]   because their products are better and more efficient.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.200]   I don't know if I would agree with that.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.280]   Here's another question for you.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.640]   And this goes from the stories that come later.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.560]   But does the leader is always closed?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.680]   This second is-- and third, as a defense, go to open.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.120]   So Apple, even though it may not be the biggest in size,
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.280]   is the biggest in quality.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.760]   So it's very closed.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.840]   Google's response to that is to be very open.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.000]   Search is number one.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.960]   It's very closed.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.160]   But other functions that other people have are open.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.200]   Is that going anywhere?
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.600]   Does that--
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.280]   Well, that's true.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.560]   I mean, not to sound like a total Google fan girl,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.720]   but let's not forget that Google was certainly
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.800]   way first with voice interaction.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.520]   I mean, they had voice--
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.000]   Yes, well, that's the point.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.120]   That's what Apple does.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.680]   All right.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.560]   They come along second and say, Steve's a tweaker.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.760]   He's a tweaker.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.520]   Right, exactly.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.040]   But Google rolls it out and says, how are people using voice?
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.120]   They've had Google Voice out for years now.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.680]   I mean, I'm sure they're using Google Voice transcription data
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.920]   to get better at transcription.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.440]   I hope so.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.200]   So they're using the data to very slowly improve the product
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.880]   while we all make fun of what our Google Voice transcript
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.120]   sound like, right?
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.040]   But then Apple comes along with much more
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.960]   polished product.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.680]   So this is kind of like open first and then closed, Jeff,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.600]   which is what you were suggesting that it's the other way
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.240]   around.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.760]   Right, right.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.480]   OK, that's why I'm starting to get my hand around.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.160]   All right, so if you're Google, what's your strategy?
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.720]   Again, Siri may not take over the world.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.520]   I thought that having a front and back camera on the iPhone
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.320]   would change human interaction.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.120]   I knew it wouldn't.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.600]   I always knew that nobody wants a video call.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   Nobody.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.360]   You know, all right.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.760]   That was a grandma, maybe.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.240]   That's a tablet.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.000]   But if you're Google and if you do see a threat from Siri
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.360]   and you say you're right, Gina, well, we've had boys,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.760]   what should they do?
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.480]   What should Google do now that Siri's out?
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.840]   And is so much better?
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.680]   Is that the question?
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.360]   And not just that it's out and better, but OK, fine.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.960]   You make their voice better, but then how do you get us to use
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.200]   it in ways that are integrated?
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.000]   I mean, I think that--
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.320]   I mean, Apple sets the bar for what people expect
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.160]   from voice interaction.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.120]   You see those Siri commercial.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.000]   I haven't actually used Siri yet, but I'm dying to.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.160]   You see those Siri commercials and you're like, this is amazing.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.440]   Google's had voice commands forever.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   Google now kind of Apple did the same thing with the iPhone.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.880]   And even though Schmidt says they started Android before the iPhone got released,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.760]   the iPhone got released.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.720]   And suddenly everyone's expectations of what a touch-pain smartphone should
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.680]   be changed, right?
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.800]   So in a way, Apple has done this with Siri too.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.040]   Like Google voice commands were cool and kind of nerdy.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.880]   And we would have our wives laugh at us when we tried to use them.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.600]   OK, shh, shh.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.800]   I'm going to talk to the phone now.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.720]   Right, but now Apple is really Siri.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.000]   And it's really cool.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.320]   I've got this personal assistant that I talk to into my phone or whatever.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.520]   So Google now really has to kind of do what they do, right?
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.800]   Catch up and surpass with the nerdy take, with the nerdy improvements.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.400]   And then another design focus company makes it human again.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.720]   All right, all right, princess of the nerds.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.280]   The developer bucket I always throw you in.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.080]   OK, so how does-- if Google's going to play catch up here and play scale here,
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.760]   they're going to have to open up the voice thing as an API?
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.960]   True?
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   Yes.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.360]   That's what Apple has to do too.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   They both have to.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.520]   So you as a developer, how does voice get your juices--
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.600]   you're salivating.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.760]   I think that there's huge potential for what you can do with voice.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.800]   I mean, how many articles have been written about the funny things that you can say to
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.160]   Siri and what the responses are?
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.120]   I mean, people love the delight and the stuff.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.440]   And not just the jokey, will you marry me, Siri?
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.080]   And you're getting a fun response from that.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   I mean, opening up those APIs and having tons of developers being able to build on
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.160]   top of those APIs, Google and advantage that Apple won't have as much, right, without
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:19.920]   opening things up.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.200]   Is it-- is it developers can plug that voice functionality into everything that they're
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   working on?
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.440]   So if you're going to go open, pursue it aggressively.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.160]   Open, open, open, open APIs.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.800]   Do it aggressively.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   That's your best hope.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   And I think that--
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   You've also got to tie it to the device, right?
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.400]   If you want to give a command to your device--
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.600]   But you can go to your web browser.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   Right.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.880]   But you can't have a call somebody.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.480]   Well, right.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   Okay.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.480]   Some devices don't have a--
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.960]   Add to your calendar, right?
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:56.520]   Google could do is really integrate like crazy into docs and calendar and plus and all that,
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   I guess, right?
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   Absolutely.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520]   I mean, it'll be interesting.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:06.080]   I wonder if in a few years making a website will involve making not only a touchscreen interface,
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.760]   which now making a website involves making a touchscreen interface, right?
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   It has to look good on an iPad or an Android device.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.720]   But making a website will also involve making a voice interface.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   Wow.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   Interesting.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.600]   I now make all my appointments through Siri.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.800]   And when I can't, when I have to type it in, I get angry.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   Wow.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   It's like, I don't want to do this.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   Oh.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   Too much maintain in the ass.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   I really do want to marry Siri.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   You love it, Leo.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.120]   Well, think about this.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.080]   You press the button and you say, make an appointment for me Thursday at five to get the
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   car washed.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.240]   And it does it.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.280]   That's so much easier than any other opening the calendar going to the day.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.280]   Amen.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.120]   But as forgetful as I am.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.360]   It's so much easier.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   Wow.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.400]   The Curtis B has a very interesting point in the chat room.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.360]   He's saying, well, don't forget where Google makes its money is embedded ads and search
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.160]   results that even if that's what I'm saying, even if Apple continues to use Google.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.840]   That's and they could say, here's your search results Google, but there's no ad.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.680]   Siri's not going to say what it's a voice response.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.800]   Siri's not going to say Google says, right?
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.360]   Or or well, even if it does say Google says it cares.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.000]   So give them all the credit you want.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.520]   There's still no ad.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.240]   But when you ask Siri a question to get data back, there's a verbal response, but there's
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.720]   also a screen response.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.800]   Yeah, it doesn't read.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.320]   It doesn't yet read the, for instance, Wolfram Alpha.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.280]   If you say, what is the color blue?
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.080]   It shows us a swatch of blue and it says from Wolfram Alpha.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.160]   If you say how many calories in a bagel, it shows the Wolfram Alpha search result.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.400]   They clearly licensed this from Wolfram Alpha.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.880]   By the way, brilliant.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.880]   Yes.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.840]   It's one of the most valuable features of Siri.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   You know, I don't know.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.280]   I just, we're in the, in the flux here.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.160]   Of course, all of the people at this PubCon who are, who spent their last three years
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.000]   trying to figure out how optimized for search engine results are going, no, please.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Don't Google.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Please.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Please.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Please.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   No.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.440]   So Google has a new algorithm.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.400]   We now have a brand pages on Google plus scoble says Google screwed it up.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   I'm inclined to agree.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.560]   We're going to talk about that in just a bit.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.200]   Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   We are talking about Google on this week in Google.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.280]   Before we go any further though, let me talk about Ford a little bit.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   We have sent out invites.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.240]   If you didn't get your invite to the barbecue we're doing on the weekend on this Sunday
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:30.520]   and on December 4th, we got way, we got hundreds and hundreds of requests.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.920]   I think we sent out 65 invites to both days.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.520]   I hope we'll see you at the barbecue.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   It's going to be great fun.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   I can't wait.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.360]   Sunday is our next one.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.560]   And we've got some really good food coming.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.040]   With on the December 4th, we will not do a barbecue.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.760]   We realize the weather is likely to be pouring rain.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.480]   So we're going to just take it indoors.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.880]   Just as an update on that one.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.880]   Either way though, it's going to be fun.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.280]   You're going to watch the game show and all that stuff.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.240]   Now, let me talk about Ford a little bit.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.680]   Ford of course, it has some great speaking of voice technology.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.440]   Ford Sync where you talk to your car is amazing.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.040]   Your car now talks back to you by the way with the App Link.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.680]   OpenBeak is the first to do this.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.360]   You could say, read me my tweets.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.460]   Read me my timeline.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.460]   Read me my replies.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.240]   And it will read them to you.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.960]   On some phones, you can.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.600]   It will read you your text messages, which is awesome.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.560]   This App Link is very cool because Ford, I know this because Alan Malawi, the CEO, told
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.560]   me.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.360]   He said, "Fones iterate much faster than we can iterate a car design."
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.160]   So what we decided to do was tie into the smartphone.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.000]   So when new capabilities come to the smartphone, we can take advantage of them.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.880]   That's this App Link API.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.040]   Brilliant.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   My Ford Touch.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.680]   Did you see this?
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.960]   250,000 My Ford Touch users are going to get a USB key in the mail.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   They get in their car.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   They plug it into the USB port.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.320]   It updates touch.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.280]   This is called 21st Century Automotive Design.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.880]   And Ford is the absolute leader.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.960]   You can find out more about it at Ford.com/technology or better yet.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.000]   Go to your Ford dealer and ask to drive the new 2012 Fiesta with App Link.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.200]   The 2012 Focus that turns into a Wi-Fi access spot.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.720]   So many cool things they are doing.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.920]   I'm just really thrilled to be associated with them.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.040]   We're really pleased to be partners with Ford in this because I think Ford is, of all
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.720]   the car companies right now, the most forward thinking and doing the most interesting stuff.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.400]   And I just think they're great.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   But polished blue oval.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.760]   Sorry, the Ford is a Wi-Fi hotspot, right?
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.720]   So you could just be parked around that when you're tailgating or something and you're
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   all online.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   They have access.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.880]   They have WPA passwords.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   So you're, yes.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.520]   Right, but that's cool though.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.320]   Your car's an excess point is hysterical.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.560]   Anyway, Ford.com/technology.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.160]   Thank you, Ford, for supporting this week in Google.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.680]   So I immediately went yesterday.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.000]   I know Eileen did for all about Android, right?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.040]   You created a brand page.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.360]   I created a Twitch brand page.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.920]   A couple of problems.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.000]   Anybody can create a Twitch brand page, right?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.160]   Yeah, I think there's a fake one up there, right?
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.320]   I was hoping to get somebody from Google+, Oh, good luck.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.720]   The Python support scripts is not going to help you.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.880]   So there's problem number one.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   That's the official one.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.360]   This is our official page.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.760]   It's only got one post on there because here's the other problem.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.120]   I registered it.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.840]   Only I can do anything with it.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   That's the scobles.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   Scobles is right about that.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840]   Scobles is right about that.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   He's absolutely right.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   He registered Rackspace quickly.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.680]   You know, you want to grab those brands, right?
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.600]   But now he realizes he is the only guy who can post to the Google+ Rackspace brand page
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.160]   unless he gives his, and I'm not going to give my Gmail credentials to everybody in
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   the company.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.200]   So we need some delegation capabilities.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.880]   I'm sure Google is going to do that, I hope.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   They've got to.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.520]   We need other admins.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.200]   It's really useless for me because I don't have time to post all the Twitch stuff.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.000]   And there's no automated features either.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.160]   So there's no way I can do that.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160]   Right.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.720]   The API is read only, right?
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.000]   So we can't auto post.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Right.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I'm not just kind of disappointed with the pages rollout because we waited so long for
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   it.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And it's really interesting to see how you're doing.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And I'm just going to say, I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I'm not going to do that.

[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   I'm not going to do that.

[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I'm not going to do that.

[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   I'm not going to do that.

[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   I'm not quite understanding it.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.640]   The company is focused on making its services better and not watching the competition.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.520]   Yeah, right.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.000]   It's just chance that it looks exactly like Facebook.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.560]   It just chance.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.640]   I got to say, it's not going to earn the ability to make that statement.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   I mean, come on.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:11.120]   Google+ is, Google is clearly playing catch up with Facebook, with Google+.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:16.400]   I mean, even Stephen Levy and the Plex described how they had that panic moment of like, oh,
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.800]   crap, Facebook's doing something really important.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:25.120]   If we don't do something about it soon, we're going to be left in the dust.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:31.000]   Of course, I think Bradley's response was appropriate, but my fun whole thing really
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   amusing.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   There's Charlie Rose in this pink tie.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.480]   What you're right, you're right, Gina, too, is that Zuckerberg's been saying that every
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.920]   business is going to become social.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.240]   I guess the extent of that is even Google.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.240]   You know, he can have music.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.920]   The question is, can they?
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.440]   The question is, can they do it and survive?
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.960]   Can they make that pivot?
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   It's a pivot.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.320]   Well, we were just talking about it a minute ago.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.320]   That's where they're changing.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:03.040]   That's why search, by being fresher, search is, in fact, more social.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.840]   Because how do they know it's fresh and hot?
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.840]   Social.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.840]   Sharing.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:08.840]   Right.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   Yep.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:15.840]   Zuck also said that Google, Yahoo and Microsoft collect data behind your back.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:21.680]   On the other hand, we collect data right in your face.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.760]   He says, but I have to say, I admire Zuck for not saying, you know, Google stole our ideas
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.120]   and we're going through nuclear war on it.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.600]   He's got a little trouble talking about it.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.000]   I think he wants to avoid that light of it.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.640]   Yeah, I think he learned the lesson.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.920]   He downplays the notion that Facebook's at war with Apple, Google and Microsoft.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.800]   He took, you know, some nice little shots.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:46.520]   But mostly, I think his message was the message that Facebook paid those PR people to spread,
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.720]   which is that it's not just us collecting data.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.200]   Everybody else is collecting data.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.480]   In fact, he says that they're collecting more data and behind your back.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.760]   Zuckerberg's been saying to me, what he said to me when I interviewed him was, when you
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.600]   get a green day ad on your page, you know it's because you said you'd like to see it.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.600]   It's like green day.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.800]   There's nothing mysterious about that.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.400]   And that these are things that you're doing for your life.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.240]   Whereas everybody else that he created an application that does that because you want
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   to do it.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.360]   Whereas everybody else is kind of getting it on the slide because it's not part of what
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.360]   you're really doing.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.760]   It is a byproduct.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.880]   Whereas a Facebook, it is the real product.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.680]   He also says that Facebook gives you more control.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.880]   And he acknowledges that's very important.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.680]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.160]   I think it's well, it's truer now than it was.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.160]   Right.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.520]   And he says that, Cheryl, Cheryl Sandberg said that it's like a caller ID.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.000]   Remember when caller ID came out, people were up in arms.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.280]   They said it was a violation of the college privacy that have their numbers revealed.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.960]   It's now mainstream and it's expected.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.560]   And she says, so people get used to it.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.240]   She says people get used to it.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:57.800]   Does that seem a reasonable?
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   I think that actually does seem reasonable.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   I think it does seem reasonable.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.040]   It's a good, it's a good metaphor.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.280]   You know what, prank calls don't happen the way that they used to.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.280]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   Since a caller ID.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.520]   I mean, people change their behavior about how they use the phone for the better.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.280]   And doesn't it annoy the hell out of you when people block their caller ID?
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.280]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.280]   I hate it.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   It's like I want to know.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   It's crazy.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.280]   I want to know.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   Right.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.640]   I pick up the phone differently depending on whether or not I know who it is.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.480]   I presume that they're it's not somebody I want to talk to.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.840]   Unfortunately, one of my wife's best friends is blocked your caller ID.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.720]   So I see caller unavailable.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.080]   I go, "Ah, it's Michelle."
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.080]   Right.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   Right.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.520]   I have that one person in my life who, you know, one person is blocked.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.080]   I said, "Oh, I know who this is."
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.240]   I won't let them tell anybody.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.680]   Well, I think that Cheryl's point was a good one.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:53.520]   I don't think that saying Facebook collecting data about you is as harmless as caller ID.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.120]   Because because of that behavioral change.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:59.600]   Like, I think that people are still learning that when they say, "Oh, yeah, I like Green
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.840]   Day," that they're not just sort of saying, "I like Green Day."
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   Yes.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.520]   They're providing a signal to Facebook, "Give me Green Day."
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.960]   And I think that there's a difference.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:13.480]   There's a difference between, you know, just having a thought and publishing a thought.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:19.080]   And you think users know that that that like button is that's not just telling Green Day
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.680]   I like you, but telling they know that that's telling Facebook.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.280]   I think our audience does.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   Our audience does that.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.520]   You know, sometimes I'm reading an article.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.520]   Michael's a great article.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.320]   And I just I go to hit the like button and I'm like, "Oh, you know, this is going to show
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   up in my stream.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.800]   You know, maybe this is going to, you know, everyone's going to think that I agree with
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.800]   everything authors said."
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   And I think twice about it because I realized what the implications are.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.920]   But I think it's just so easy to just say, "Oh, yeah, you know, I like this."
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   And then some of the--
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   So that changes too with the verb, you know, changing from like to reading.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.920]   Yes.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.040]   Because what they're trying to do too is it just becomes actions rather than opinions.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:52.720]   There was the Washington Post or the-- they did the Washington Post for NPR.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.000]   They always get their knickers and nuts about this.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.040]   Schooled at a journalist for retweeting something when that they should have shown that they
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.320]   didn't agree or something.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:06.120]   So someone was proposing a new notion, which I don't much like, that we have RT.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.840]   We have MT modified tweet.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.480]   The next one was NT neutral tweet.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.480]   Retweet.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.480]   That's interesting.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   I just think this is interesting and you should see it.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.000]   But I don't necessarily agree or disagree or endorse.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.840]   And basically it should be DFBT, which is don't fire me.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.840]   Oh boy.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.840]   There should also be like CYA tweets.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   Right.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   I better.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.840]   You would agree.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   You know.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   Required tweet.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:35.840]   The boss looking.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   Rose asked Zuckerberg when Facebook would hit a billion users.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   Zuck said, "If we do well end of 2012."
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   Yikes.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.840]   Wow.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   That's a significant number.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.840]   He said, "One of the ways that'll happen is through China."
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   With danger.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   Danger.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.640]   Well, well, Sandberg said, "You can't connect the whole world and not."
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   "Connect China, but because of the restrictions--"
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.440]   They're trying to get us ready for whatever compromises they're about to make.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.720]   You're right.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:04.360]   This is plan PR and they're going to start--
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.360]   Exactly.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.440]   They've got to go through the Google territory now with China.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.200]   Well, the way things are going in China, they're going to have to make a lot of compromises.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.200]   And that's a real problem.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   Yep.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:18.520]   Because one thing, architecturally, the problem Google made was they made different rules in
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.520]   China.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   Right.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.160]   And they thus violated their principles.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.240]   So Facebook, in my mind, had better hold principles here.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.640]   And if it treats China differently than it treats the rest of the world, then what are
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.000]   their damn principles?
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.360]   So if China requires that someone provides their identification card in order to sign
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.880]   up for Facebook, which is where things are going with microblogging services in China
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.480]   right now, where you have to provide your identification cards so that they associate
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.960]   every single account with a real person, do you think that that's reasonable or unreasonable
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   comments?
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.160]   That's really interesting, Gina, because basically that's what Google's doing.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   Google's doing.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   Google's doing Google's doing Google's doing Google's doing Google's doing Google's
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   doing Google's doing Google's doing Google's doing Google's doing Google's doing Google
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.160]   papers.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.160]   Please, where are your papers?
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.240]   I mean, I think it's a problem, don't you, Gina?
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.960]   I mean, that's the whole real name thing.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.560]   I don't think Facebook's going to have a problem with that.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.560]   No, I think they'll agree to that.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   I don't want to feel names.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.560]   You know, and this will just be a matter of making sure they really, you know, they're
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.560]   really here's the next thing.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.920]   Here's the next thing, which I got a problem at, but fine.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:21.000]   Let's say that the Oops, darkness, Facebook's a bad Jeff.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   So the next thing is what's Facebook's policy on handing over your private stuff?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.800]   Well, that's the thing, right.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   Right.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:35.600]   Once the identification card is provided, that has the ability to see and verify all
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.000]   that everything that you publish.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.520]   Facebook says, no, no, no, they don't.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.160]   Not if you haven't friended them and you made everything private to somebody.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.600]   But Facebook says we comply with the local laws in every region.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:53.760]   But here in the US, that means subpoenas and it means that it's we hope discoverable.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.800]   What if China says, no, we just, we just get to read everybody's stuff.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.400]   We get to read everybody's stuff and we get to delete the stuff that we don't like.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.200]   I mean, that's the next step.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   Right.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   That's the next step.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   How far will Facebook go?
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   What are their real principles?
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   That's a good question.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.600]   It would be interesting to see what happens.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   All I know is I can get porn on my Google TV.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.600]   It's not.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:20.400]   You know, I was thinking jobs is just spinning in his grave.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.400]   He's just spinning in his grave.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.800]   I'm still waiting for the update to my Logitech review to Honeycomb.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.000]   I'm really excited about that every day, every night.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   I reconnected it and every night I go settings, no update.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Me too.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Me too.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.800]   Although Matt, how he posted a photo of his Sony unit.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.600]   Yeah, the Sony's, Sony's happening.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.800]   So, shops is smiling about something else today.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   What's that?
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   Flash.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:43.800]   Yes.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   Victory.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.800]   Yes.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.120]   Adobe has decided that they will no longer support Flash in the mobile environment.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.000]   So not just iOS, but across the board.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.680]   You know, it never worked well on Android.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.960]   So they said, and it's actually a victory for not just jobs, I think, for HTML5.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   They say we're going to.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   And they said straight out.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   It's better.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   No, growing up points to them for saying it.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.280]   Yep.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.280]   Yep.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.120]   Yeah, but there's definitely an eye told just coming from a new grave.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   That's for sure.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.120]   Good.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.120]   Did you do the right thing?
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.200]   I think it was right to do that.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.120]   And I'm glad Adobe finally let it happen.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.960]   Is that what you said at the time, Leo?
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   Yes.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   It was.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.680]   I did support that because Flash is, first of all, a major security problem, but mostly
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   it's a pig.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.360]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:33.720]   And what I said, I believe, and we should go back and look at the tape.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.680]   But what I believe I said was this is going to be good.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.680]   We're going to get rid of Flash.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.960]   It doesn't belong on the, I don't like Flash in general.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:42.360]   It reduces accessibility on websites.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:48.400]   It makes, I think it's not an asset on a website and HTML5 is available.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.400]   There are better solutions.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.920]   And it makes things less searchable than not.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.400]   Silverlight is also getting some bad signals too, right?
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.920]   Never liked that either, but I don't know.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.760]   There was also news about that today too.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.800]   I don't remember either, but Microsoft is all in on Silverlight.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.800]   So I think that that's.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.400]   No, I heard there was some lack of support on Silverlight.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.240]   Let's see if this new fresh Google search.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.240]   I do a fresh search on that.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.120]   It helps my spell.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.440]   How about the Nook tablet and the fire?
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.080]   We're going to get those next week.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.640]   Amazon's fire comes out November, what, 15th?
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.680]   And then the following that, the Nook tablet comes out November 17th.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.000]   It will be 50 bucks more.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.480]   They're touting the fact that it has twice the memory, twice the speed.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.920]   Will anybody even notice?
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.000]   Will anybody even care?
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.640]   If you can get Amazon for 50 bucks less, don't you think you're going to do that?
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.120]   I think that Barnes and Noble's got a challenge here.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.040]   Well, I haven't seen it up on the Nook.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.720]   Does it have more of Android in it?
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.640]   No, it's the same.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.600]   It's basically the same.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.360]   But you're buying it from BNN, not Amazon.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.400]   We have breaking news from--
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.400]   Breaking news.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.400]   It's not really breaking news.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.160]   Tom Merritt, ladies and gentlemen of TNT Tech News today, which--
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.160]   Very cool.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.160]   --which Foley reported that sources told her Silverlight 5 will be the last Silverlight.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.360]   Holy cow.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.960]   That was the story.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.440]   Holy cow.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:11.520]   Microsoft was equivocating at their last conference over Silverlight.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.280]   They didn't want to say about Windows 8 and Silverlight, so now we know.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.360]   As a developer, I'd just love to see how mobile devices and smaller screens are affecting
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:28.320]   decisions about web design and about the way that we make the web simplifying design and
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.840]   also getting us back to the place where we're trying to preserve CPU site levels and preserve
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840]   memory.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.000]   Those constraints, I think, are actually a really good thing.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   Cut out hogs like Flash and Silverlight, I guess.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.640]   I'm moving fast because we want to get a few more headlines in and we got to get going
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.640]   for TNT.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:52.160]   Eric Schmidt responds to the Jobs book saying, "I've decided not to comment on what's been
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.160]   written in a book after his death, according to Reuters.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.680]   Steve is a fantastic human being and someone who I miss very dearly."
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.480]   As a general comment, I think most people would agree.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:07.000]   Google is a great innovator and I would also point out that the Android effort started
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.720]   before the iPhone effort.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.000]   That is his response to...
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.800]   A game of last word, yeah.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   I guess he does have the last word on that.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.120]   What about fact check?
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.960]   Is that the case?
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:26.240]   The open mobile alliance, the Android pre-Google Android, certainly predates iPhone.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.280]   There's no way to tell how much the iPhone did or didn't affect what Android is today.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.360]   The first Google phone was released.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.360]   They shipped before.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.360]   Before?
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360]   Well, the iPhone came out...
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.920]   Yeah, the iPhone came out before the first-
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   Before?
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   Sure.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   So there's no way to tell.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.920]   I remember getting the G1.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   The G1 was very disappointing.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.920]   It was a break.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   It was a break.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   It was.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   It was.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.640]   And I remember that Colleen, who's a big Google fan girl and ended up going to Google,
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.080]   of course, did not like the iPhone.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.120]   I had the iPhone, original iPhone, and she said, "No wait until November.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120]   Wait until November.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.480]   Wait until the Google phone comes out."
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.040]   So I don't know.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.760]   I think that the fact check on what Eric said may hold differently.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.720]   That may be the last word.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.800]   Let's see what else.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.480]   There's a new activity tab on Twitter.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.720]   If you go to your Twitter webpage, you'll see activity.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:27.000]   Looks a little bit like, in fact, exactly like the Facebook activity stream.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.920]   Favorites follows and tweets from people you follow.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   So look at that.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.000]   Yeah, it exposes interesting.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.320]   You can see who your friends have recently followed and favored it and exposes more activity
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.520]   on Twitter, which I like.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   I think that's useful.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.360]   There's also the right area over here to activity.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.480]   All right, my friends, we're going to get to our...
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.960]   I'll give you one chance because I know you all have pet stories before we get to our
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.240]   tool tip and number of the week.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.560]   Last thoughts.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.520]   I want to have a lot of drunk readers, so I have to mention that there's a Chipotle nutrition
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520]   calculator online.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.760]   So you can Chipotle responsibly and healthily.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.120]   And somebody went after me saying, "Oh, watch out, Jarvis."
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.720]   But I don't have the Barbara Koah.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.280]   I just have veggie with black beans and whites and the new brown whites.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.720]   Nutritionix.com/ Chipotle.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.040]   The Barbara Koah is so good, though, Jeff.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.600]   Is it really fattening?
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.520]   Is it really bad?
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.560]   I think anything called Barbara Koah is going to be pretty bad.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560]   Why?
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560]   It's just barbecue.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.560]   Uh-huh.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.760]   I already got my glee review in and the pre-show, so I'm good.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.200]   But I had to say glee at least once.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.720]   If you didn't see last light's glee episode, then...
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   I didn't.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.960]   It's the sex episode, apparently.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.200]   The sex episode, yeah.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.600]   Parental guidance suggested.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   Yes, parental approval.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.600]   Maybe that's what they meant on my Google TV.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.080]   I don't know.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.520]   Hey, that porn app, by the way, is not an Android app.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.920]   It's just a Google TV optimized website.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   Ah, okay.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.920]   Yes.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   So.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   No way anybody could stop that.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.920]   Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.320]   And no one wants to watch porn on their TV anyway.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320]   So...
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.320]   I don't know what to say.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.320]   That's Paul's pause here, Gina.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.320]   I'm thinking.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320]   I don't know what that means.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   I know.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   I expected something from you.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   I'm trying to think of that means.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   I don't know what that means.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   I'm sure.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.920]   But you want it on a smaller screen.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   Oh.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   Okay.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.920]   Some people want it on a bigger screen.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.520]   That's actually an age thing, Gina, because back of the day we didn't have a small screen.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.520]   I think size doesn't matter.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.520]   That's what I've told.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.520]   Okay, you had to get the VCR, lock yourself in the den.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520]   Oh.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.720]   Back in the real day, which I didn't have the courage to do, you had a really big scene.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   You had to go to a movie theater.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   And then a red coat.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   How strange is that?
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720]   Oh my God.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.320]   I don't think porn really took off until you could get it at home.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   Oh, that was real.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.720]   I used to live across from Brooklyn Heights.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   I lived by one.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the guys sculpt.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:29.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:36.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:14.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:31.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:38.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:48.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:02.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:12.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:19.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:26.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:36.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:48.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   And I'd sit at McDonald's and watch the girls.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.960]   So nothing will mend us there, but I found that the low number on
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.720]   liking was kind of interesting.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.120]   I want to mention, as my tool of the week, Google Authenticator--
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.160]   we've talked about this before.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.120]   It's an app for Android.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.040]   And iPhone has a version as well.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.600]   You run the app, and it will give you a token.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.680]   And now, of course, in order to use Google Authenticator,
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.640]   you have to have a site that does what we call two-factor
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.160]   authentication, a password plus the token.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.680]   By having it in your cell phone, somebody in order to crack
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.080]   that account would have to know your password
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.640]   and have your phone itself, which is, I think, a really good
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.440]   secondary form of authentication.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.520]   And the tool I use for password authentication, LastPass,
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.640]   has just added that in its update.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.560]   So that if you use LastPass, now, you're definitely going to
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.240]   want to use Google Authenticator.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.840]   It used to be you had to have your own authentication program
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.800]   running on a USB key.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.440]   Now you just have it on your phone.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:46.400]   So a really good way to secure LastPass and all your
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.560]   passwords--
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.240]   Google Authenticator, it's free from Google iPhone and Android.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.120]   And no, Eric Schmidt is not the tool of the week.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.040]   That LastPass step is a really good one, though.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.280]   Yeah, isn't LastPass great?
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:00.720]   I love it.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720]   LastPass is awesome.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.720]   And adding second-factor authentication through Google
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.080]   Authenticator's fan dash pick.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.560]   LastPass has both free and paid versions.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.080]   The paid version is a buck a month.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:12.720]   Worth getting the most.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.680]   Yeah, totally worth it.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.160]   I paid for it, just for the mobile app.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.480]   I agree.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.600]   Gina Trapani is at smartawear.org.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.120]   That's her blog.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.240]   You've got to read it every day.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.040]   Great stuff.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.080]   And of course, she works on this amazing ThinkUp app, which
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.600]   is being used more and more by people.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.680]   Did you see that Steve Martin is putting out a book of his
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.360]   tweets?
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.280]   Yes, I did.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.720]   And you're the enabler.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.720]   Yeah, I'm excited.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.760]   The book of tweets is going to include replies.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.600]   And yes, there was a point at which I was explaining to him
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.880]   how to get to the CBS file.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.360]   The CSV file.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.840]   And so yeah, I think I think I've helped him out with that.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.840]   So I'm sorry for that.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.320]   That's what he said.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.280]   When he said, I want to--
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.960]   he said, I need a way-- he asked me.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.480]   I said, I need a way to collate my tweets and replies,
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.480]   because I'm thinking maybe a book.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.160]   This was a long time ago.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.360]   And I said, well, let's get you together with Gina and
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:00.960]   ThinkUp.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.280]   And so I was going to think up account for some time.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.360]   Yeah, you hooked me up.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.240]   Yeah, he has great data, incredible charts.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.760]   Well, I expect there'll be an acknowledgment for you in
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:10.760]   the book.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.280]   I would expect.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.040]   I hope so.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040]   That'd be exciting.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.800]   That's neat.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.600]   And his tweets are hysterical, so I think it'll be a
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:15.800]   great one.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.560]   Yeah, it's very funny.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.200]   You're his gateway to the tweeter.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.320]   And of course, don't forget Jeff Jarvis at buzzmachine.com.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.440]   And his book is Public Parts You Must Get It.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.120]   It's in better bookstores everywhere and a really
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:30.600]   interesting discussion.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.440]   But not in airports, which pisses me off.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.800]   So people when you go to an airport to be a favor, ask
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.200]   for it.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.000]   You mean all airports are some--
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.800]   Because they're bozos who do airport deals.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.280]   So I ask people to collect--
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.600]   by friends all ask for it in airports, is that a good
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:45.800]   thing?
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.720]   They said yes.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.080]   So harass them.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:48.720]   OK, good.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.120]   They pay attention to that.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.320]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:51.880]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.960]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.480]   We do this show at 1 p.m.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.400]   Pacific, 4 p.m.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.600]   Eastern Time at twit.tv.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.600]   So you can watch live.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.320]   And 1 p.m.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.680]   Pacific is now 2100 UTC.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.240]   Eileen Rivera, our producer.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:06.960]   Yes, ma'am?
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.360]   I just wanted to do a pitch for the best of, twit.tv/bestof.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.000]   You could give us your submissions for any of our
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.040]   shows, especially this week in Google.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.520]   Just fill out a couple of forms of your favorite story.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.880]   I think us singing and dancing, our gleam moments,
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   probably, are going to get it.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.520]   Absolutely, that's going to make it.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:29.240]   But if you've got a particular story that you want to have
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.720]   us replay, we'll do that.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.360]   Excellent.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.640]   Yeah, that's for our holiday episodes, because we have a
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.200]   week in between Christmas and New Year's Day where we want
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200]   to let everybody go home.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.440]   So we'll do best of episodes on that week.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.880]   So help us out, twit.tv/bestof.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.440]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
