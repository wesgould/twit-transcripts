[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.520]   Then I saw you put on Facebook you want to you start to talk about what to do to make Facebook a better news outlet
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.580]   Yeah, I did a post about what Google could do for news and what news could do for Google and next in this series now
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.440]   A boring is Facebook and Facebook is actually already doing interesting things. I talked to them. Yeah yesterday. Yeah, so
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.920]   Nate they're doing it stuff. Nate
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.880]   And joining us in house Aaron Nukem is here. Yeah, he's with NetApp
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.960]   But he's also a regular on many of our shows at all about Androids last weekly
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.240]   He's looks like you brought a game controller just in case you got bored
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.400]   Well, I know that this is in the rundown to I don't know if we're gonna talk about it
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.280]   But there's some some gaming news with Nvidia from new shield. Yeah, yeah, so we can talk a little bit about that
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.920]   Are you a shield user? Oh, yeah, absolutely. This is mine. You have the K1 version. Oh, yeah
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.600]   Yeah, yeah, the first one. Yep. Yeah, she'll tabling. We'll talk about it. Yeah, we'll talk about that in a while
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.200]   But yeah, in fact mobile world Congress going on right now Mike Elgin is there Miriam Jour is there
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.640]   We've been doing I hope you've been watching our live coverage not only on TNT and TNT and two or news shows
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.760]   But we're also streaming live specials each day
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.960]   Day two went up and we'll date three will be going up soon
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.680]   Mike Ront wanders the show floor in search of cool stuff
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.880]   And we did cover live I got up at nine in the morning a Pacific time on Sunday to cover the Samsung event
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.600]   I didn't get up for the HTC event, which is like even earlier
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.840]   But HTC announced a new version of the HTC one is very much a evolution of the one the M9
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.360]   You guys probably talked about it last night on all about Android. Yes, you certainly love the M9 have been a big fan
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.280]   But it's there's nothing to knock me out there. You know, they replaced that silly ultra pixel
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.880]   What was it for mega pixel camera on the on the back with a 20-megapixel real camera?
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.160]   But they put the ultra pixel on the front everybody's doing spatter selfie cams. Mm-hmm. You know where I'm a little disappointed
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.400]   I really thought that we would start to see better audio dacks in phones high res DACs
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.520]   This year. I really expected HTC to do it. I thought Samsung might do it neither
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.360]   And so that's a little disappointing because I thought this was gonna be the year for a high res music to take off
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.400]   Not so waiting for a for a phone to have kind of a Korean stretchy thing. So you have a built-in selfie stick
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.720]   Yeah, I built it instead of a kickstand
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.760]   Kickstand thing didn't work out, but they're getting bigger if you just make them a little bit bigger. You wouldn't you know, just take a picture from the top
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.840]   It's out there
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.160]   And fortunately that phone though takes up a lot of space the OS
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.800]   OS is those what's where I've read anyways the OS takes up a nine. Mm-hmm. Yeah, like free space
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.480]   Right, so you I think it takes up a new sense even though it has more storage included it takes up
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.240]   Was like 30% of the storage your available storage is just taken up from the OS. That's not good now
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.080]   Samsung I think actually has the phone of the
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.840]   Show with the new Galaxy S6 edge
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.880]   Are you are you convinced with the double edge? Well, let me I'll say a couple of things first
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.880]   It's disappointing that Samsung
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   Which really that was the last holdout for removable batteries and in SD cards, you know the back would come
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.360]   Yeah, but in order to do that you have to have a crappy plastic ugly back
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.960]   So they've gone to this full aluminum design with a glass back of all things kind of like the iPhone 4
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   And so you but supposedly better battery life anyway with a better battery and more juice
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.840]   Protection in the X and O's processor
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.960]   It comes in 128 gig version as well as 32 and 64 so I guess that's okay. I guess it's okay
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.800]   I still like to have the option. I mean we've seen this before right?
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   I mean no one's gonna need more was it no one's getting more than 4 meg of me
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.480]   Yeah, we've seen this before for most people. It's fine. I think for power users like me
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.840]   I always want to have that extra capacity just so that I can switch stuff out change things around but at least they're at least
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.040]   They're not giving you a device. That's you know 16 gig and no SD card, right? That's awful, right?
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.960]   Yeah, they've also touched touch which is if they've continued to step back with touch was it looks pretty pure lollipop?
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.680]   But it's still they're gonna still worried about is is you know even the the underlying OS in the Samsung phone
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.080]   You know the settings and stuff like that. I just find it's logic different. It is. Yeah, it is
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.480]   Here they're comparing their own two phones the I guess that's an s5 with the s6 or is that a note for with now?
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.080]   It's an s5 looks like that's fine the new design. I think the thing that really is interesting about the s6 actually is the edge
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.520]   This is not the same as the note for edge which I did not like they know for had two screens a flat one and a curved edge run
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.000]   That was a completely separate screen and could do a lot more than the galaxy s6
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.240]   You could have screensavers on it and you could really set a lot of different things in there
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.520]   But it just it didn't work very well. It was upside down for one thing which always bugged me
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.760]   I could never get it to work the way it was supposed to work
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.560]   This is not this is one screen that just curves
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.680]   They're melting the screen and curving it around and so it doesn't actually add a lot of functionality
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.400]   I guess you can't have because it's a super amoled screen
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.120]   You can't have the fact that you can have these five fringes are constantly on the edge
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.840]   But I don't use my phone for connecting with people. I mean I use it more for connecting with information than people
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.560]   Well, this is yeah, but this is I think the edge
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.280]   That's just using the extra screen real estate for something else the edge really is it I think about beauty about design. Yes
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:13.240]   It is it is and in this case and I think it's very pretty and of course everybody's worried about the fact that this phone is almost entirely glass
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.200]   Glass back and a curves edge screen
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:25.160]   Which will make it very vulnerable although it is gorilla glass for I think that's actually quite lovely. Yeah
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.720]   But we'll say Mike and and draw a company say it felt
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.800]   Miriam liked a while Miriam Miriam was raving about I don't know what Mike said. I don't know if Mike liked it or not
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.120]   I'm here. I'm talking about but the pricing we would don't get no confirmation on the really
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.480]   pricing
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.480]   unknown April 10th
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.880]   But you know Apple sells a phone the iPhone 6 plus that is a thousand dollars if you load it up
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.640]   There's a market for that they sold quite a quite a few of those
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.880]   So maybe Samsung has decided in addition to the low end phones. They continue to make to have one really nice
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.480]   Phone I think that's what you're gonna get out of the edge. You're gonna get a pretty expensive device
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:11.360]   Probably eight nine yeah around there the note for edge is I think a hundred twenty bucks more than the note for
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.960]   Something like that for that extra little screen on the side. Yeah, I don't know if it's worth it to me
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.960]   I don't think I would go for it. I mean unless there's some sort of
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.920]   Functionality there that I just can't live without I don't know I don't know it's style points more than anything. Yeah
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   Well, that's why I want it cuz I'm a stylish guy
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   Yeah
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.360]   I wanted to look good in my hand field. I think they'll feel good one of the things Miriam's
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   I think it was Miriam who said this
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.740]   On phones where you're swiping in from the edge a lot that having a curved screen like that
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.560]   We're just kind of flows over it is cut it feels good
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.960]   Yeah, mm-hmm. That's just a thought
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.760]   so
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.840]   camera on the
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.960]   new
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.520]   S6 is the same number of megapixel 16
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:04.120]   But they have OIS in it which the note 4 has but not the s5 and they have a
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.000]   F19
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Aperture very fast lens that's faster than anything else on the market
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.400]   So we'll see I mean it looks pretty good. They showed low light performance head-to-head against an iPhone that was really remarkable
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:25.920]   Both instills and video, but that's Samsung's demo. Here's the big news that demo was normal
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.120]   There was no Broadway numbers. Yes. Yes, which was which was great. It was about the product
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.640]   It was two of the three presenters were professional women. Yes, so this the kind of the
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.840]   Subliminal sexism of previous Samsung events is gone
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:47.360]   They obviously are were sensitized a little finally listening. Yeah. Yeah, I remember the Broadway one
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.200]   I think you and I did that and oh, it's just it was really bad. I think I was here
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.800]   I mean, we didn't make it at the time. So I'm glad they're coming around
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   I mean you need to do that
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.360]   I think and there was no fashion show weirdly dressed models prancing around it was just no ridiculous skits
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.320]   No, let's live life on our phone. Yeah, I mean, I think companies tend to do that
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.920]   they try to
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.320]   Appeal to a broader audience and when they start having a product that goes beyond the techie verse, right?
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.160]   Yeah, and they want to reach that consumer audience
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.600]   They start to they start to say well, we need to have we need to do these things without knowing what those things are right
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.240]   we need to have Broadway shows that'll appeal to people and
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.360]   You know, so it's nice to see that they're finally coming around what typically happens is that people go too far
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.400]   With that stuff without realizing it. It's nice that they're pulling it back in and connecting hopefully
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.920]   Connecting better with their core audience. They even said the words were listening now
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.160]   They were doing in reference to the phone, but I think they're also listening to what we're saying about their press events. Yeah
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.400]   Yeah, yeah, this is a kind of a chase in Samsung the s5 was such a flop
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.880]   That they realized oh
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.560]   Well, I think that's part of it too. I think they've got it
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.120]   They've maybe learned that understatement is better than overstatement
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.720]   Um, and even if you consider that we you know apple
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.680]   invented the understatement in its own weird way it became a new form of overstatement
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.320]   now, um
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.720]   I talked about this last week because I had to received it but wednesday morning in advance
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.680]   of uh, the mobile world congress
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.760]   Motorola sent us this this e now. This is the other side of the spectrum
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.760]   Here's a phone that's 150 bucks out the door the Motorola second generation e but is a great phone
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.280]   You make some sacrifices. This screen isn't as high res. It's not as big a phone
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.120]   but, um, I thought that was a I think to me
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.640]   More people will be interested in this and what that's going to do is and I think Samsung realizes is
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.040]   If you're going to make a phone that is more than 150 bucks, it better be premium. Yeah
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.840]   It better not compromise in any way
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.360]   And I think the HTC M9 is that I think the Samsung S6 is that the one plus one
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:57.200]   The one plus one is starting to look a little a little uh utility it is it is but I think I think it was interesting
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.760]   That it pushed the market it did when they said no compromises. I mean they meant it
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.640]   I think the X is six is a better phone. Yeah, but uh, it was a heck of a phone for the price and to show you what you can do
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.800]   And and and tried to put in the best of everything they could that was available to them
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.000]   Three gigs of ram in the s6 that's not an improvement
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.840]   Especially since they have a 64-bit processor and they could go quite a bit more
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.720]   Uh, they're putting their eight-way new exenos in there. Although it may be in the United States
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.600]   They use the snap drag and that's what they're done. They've done it fast. Yeah
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.560]   That has to do with the system on a chip more than the processor has to do with their radios. All right
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.200]   I think they're sticking with exenos. Are they gonna do exenos? I'm pretty sure they're sticking with exenos here in the U.S
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.280]   That's what the room was is that confirmed?
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.400]   Uh, you know, I actually that's a good question. I don't know if it's confirmed
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.960]   Samsung was saying of course, but they didn't have a bread
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.120]   Welcome chips at all. So yeah, right, um also, uh
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.240]   Uh, let's see what else
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.800]   No, uh
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.040]   I'm trying to remember
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.800]   Any other features we're missing? I wish the battery removal, but I think if they have better battery life, maybe it'll be okay
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.880]   They have quit. Oh fast charging. Yeah fast charging using no water resistance
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.280]   They're using ddr for ram
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.040]   No water resistance, which just shows that maybe that wasn't a selling point. Everybody cared about I
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.600]   Uh some did but uh
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.520]   No, um
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:23.360]   A ddr ram four which is faster and em's emmc storage, which is faster. Yep
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.960]   So, uh, we'll have to wait and see but everybody's played with the phone and barcelona says is really snappy
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.760]   With that fast processor fast memory and so forth. Yep, so
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.640]   We'll see
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.440]   We shall see it is interesting though like we're talking about Samsung, you know making changes and listening on one hand they did right
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:49.360]   For such a long time people have been complaining myself included about kind of the design
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.200]   Aspect of Samsung devices and how you know, I'm just not a huge fan of plastic and it feels cheap
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.360]   And so they've gone this this other direction and they're they're putting a lot of focus on design and peeling back
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.720]   Touchwiz and everything on the other hand a lot of their success was built on what they were doing
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:14.560]   Aside from this year, which wasn't so successful and what they were doing included removable battery included external storage
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.120]   You know, um included water resistance
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.240]   So they're really kind of betting on the fact that these changes are going to get them back to where they were
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.360]   Uh after such a uh difficulty Jason do you think it could be in a way too timid?
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.120]   You know, okay. Okay. We'd be like everybody else and we'll just do it more expensively
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.560]   Yeah, um, yeah, that that could be it too
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.120]   I don't know. I'm very curious to see if this if this works for them because they're really changing a lot
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.520]   After having so many years of doing
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.440]   Uh, you know of kind of following a very particular path. Yeah, they're straying off that path now big time
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.880]   It's it's a big bet. I wonder if the kind of the I mean it's just about a flop of the s5
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:00.560]   I mean I wonder if that kind of taught them a lesson or are they're trying to you know come back from that because I think that if the s6 is not as popular
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:08.080]   Then they're in big trouble. Right. Yeah. Yeah, two in a row would be bad. Yeah, the note still sells very well though
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   Which is interesting. No for what's the success?
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.680]   Curvula wrong, but they invented the fablage. Oh, yeah, I think they were the first
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.600]   They pushed the whole market to the giant phone and then and then didn't know what to do
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.760]   It wasn't so apple that it was okay. Yeah
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:27.600]   Blackberry announced an interesting phone a five inch touch screen for only $279. That's the leap
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.520]   Blackberry does need to do something to leap back into the market
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.440]   Um, you know the last blackberry all touch screen. I had the storm was so girl god awful
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.960]   I'd have to really think twice about this it will run blackberry 10
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.880]   Uh five inch HD display HD though is 720p not 1080p
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.000]   So only 293 only only 293 pixels per inch only
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.960]   But but I have to say that's plenty obvious on a five inch device. Yeah, that's plenty
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.760]   But when you look at the 5.1 inch s6 which has 577 pixels per inch. That's crazy
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.440]   Numbers wise doesn't look as good. Um, I don't know if that matters at all every time I see somebody with a blackberry
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.240]   Now I have to admit that I giggled. Yeah, eight megapixel camera 10 a p hd
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   They're just a little behind 1.5 gigahertz. Welcome two gigs of ram
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:25.840]   16 gigs of storage for firmware does have a micro SD card slot 25 hours. They're claiming a battery life
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.840]   So, uh, you know, I don't want to leave blackberry out. Yeah, you know what I say bring back the trio
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.160]   I don't know why you say that but i'm glad you say it
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:42.400]   I don't i'm gonna be nostalgic for some old brands the trio. I loved my trio. Yeah, I guess
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.280]   The word my trio
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.240]   Yeah, people did love this
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.160]   You know what I love my scion 3a now that was it because it wasn't a phone
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.080]   But you could have phoned in it
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.160]   Nowadays it'd be a phone. I love my trs 80 at the time. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I love my Atari 400
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   You know what I love
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.680]   We could go on and on
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.040]   Sundar pachai spoke at the mobile world congress
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:09.200]   Uh google is going to give details of its us mobile network in the coming months. Yes google
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.320]   Is going to do a us mobile network
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.240]   He also talked about the loon balloons. They're apparently close to launch
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.760]   Yeah, that's that's global. That's global internet
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:26.080]   An experimental mobile network in the united states. They want to do an mvn. Oh that is sitting on top of
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   We've mentioned this before the other carriers in fact
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.960]   Apparently what they're planning to do although pachai did not confirm it
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.880]   He said it will merge sell and Wi-Fi networks in a seamless way
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:43.360]   But apparently what they want to do is just pick whatever network works the best right now and use that right which would be my guess
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.200]   Yes, it's great. My guess is this word. I mean this is aimed
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.880]   Primarily at Kansas City and Austin and and such
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.680]   Because they keep on saying it's small and small and small
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.320]   If they have ubiquitous Wi-Fi around the markets
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.600]   Like that and you can do you know 95 percent of the time you're on Wi-Fi and only when it fails or you're out of town
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.280]   Is it on your public wireless does that that's that that's how republic wireless works?
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.600]   They prefer Wi-Fi and since there's so much open Wi-Fi around now
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.280]   But you know, but it's not really open. That's the problem
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.240]   You know the fact that I have to go to I used to have an app that would sign me into starbucks Wi-Fi and it just doesn't work anymore
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.640]   Yeah, and the fact that I have to go through the stupid page
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   I've said this on the show before I'll say it again
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.960]   Folks, I want a universal statement of giving up my rights on my firstborn and I'll sign it once
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.680]   And I want everything
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.120]   Whenever it hits a Wi-Fi I say he's already signed it. He's already agreed
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.600]   You know, you know that does work
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.760]   Not that this is a great selling point with Comcast's XFINITY service
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:49.200]   So you remember we it was a little controversial if you're a Comcast Wi-Fi customer that your Wi-Fi router also has this
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.880]   Public network aspect and here in petaluma, that's it's a Comcast town
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:01.760]   I can get Wi-Fi almost anywhere and once you sign in with XFINITY Wi-Fi once you will that's now
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.320]   a registered Wi-Fi network, so I don't have to sign in ever again and I often find I'm on Wi-Fi
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.800]   Mostly because it's not working
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.720]   And I have to know gosh just sign in the XFINITY Wi-Fi again, right?
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.560]   I hate this
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.320]   So sometimes you might want to forget it but as they get better and better with better and better signal and better connectivity
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:29.760]   That's that's a mesh network. It's very interesting or could we have you know, bloom balloons or some other strange thing that they're thinking about
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.640]   You know, I don't know you saw that Mark Zuckerberg said it isn't sci-fi that's going to get internet to the the next billion people
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.280]   It's just carriers doing the job of you know
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:46.080]   Wiring and I think he makes a good point. We talk about Facebook's drones Google's balloons. It's you know
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   There
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.600]   If you have water for the Android phone, there still is one Sony Xperia m4 aqua
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.560]   How long is Sony gonna stay in the business though?
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.480]   Well now that's a funny thing because there was uh there was some talk of them exiting the phone business
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.320]   I think their CEO some executives said we were probably we're thinking about it
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.840]   And then it was very vigorously denied by another Sony executive yesterday of the day before saying no
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.880]   We're in the phone. Well, maybe that's as long as the m4 aqua is available and then they'll get a hub and I don't know
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.640]   Um
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   It's kind of a mid-range phone
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.760]   64-bit octa-core snapdragon 615
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.960]   Lollipop two-day battery life waterproof
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.000]   Uh up to one and a half meters
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Um
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And fresh water
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.840]   No salt water allowed no scuba and chlorinated not so good and you should rinse it if you get it
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.520]   Clark
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.160]   Just written the specs starting price of
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.680]   299 euros that's about four or 500 bucks. It'll be available in 80 countries, but not the us
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.400]   Not the us. They're gonna stick with their uh their flagship phones in the us. So
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.160]   Here's a question for you. Do you think Sony could Kodak?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.600]   Could Sony die? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:08.560]   That's phenomenal. There's a big chance that might as important a company as Sony was in the consumer electronics. Yeah revolution
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.640]   Jesus. I mean, yeah, it's been suffering suffering suffering and I keep on just waiting somebody to come in somebody will fix it
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.320]   No, it could really die now. They announced, you know a plan for revitalizing uh, sony and some of it involved spinning off
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.000]   They have been spinning off a lot of stuff. They spun off the music they spun off
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.200]   TVs this I mean
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.960]   Yeah
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.160]   Uh by the way, the sam sung phone the s6 has a
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.520]   New form of payment remember they bought loop pay that's kind of an interesting technology
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.160]   Jeff needles uses it it allows you to hover your phone over a swipe terminal
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.880]   The phone sends out a magnetic field which is red as a as a real credit card being swiped
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.960]   Uh, so in in in other words sam's son's pay will have touch to pay but also this swipe capability
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.200]   Which will make it the most compatible that's gonna work far better. I think in europe than here
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.600]   I mean in europe. Do they swipe still in europe?
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.760]   Well, what yeah, no, you do you do the chip car. I thought they did chip and pen. Yeah
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.000]   But but I think those terminals, you know when they come in a restaurant in europe, they do
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   just pay at the table with the device
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.480]   Uh, well, it's it's pin but I think they also have a swipe there and I don't imagine you can hold up against that but in the in the us
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.920]   Is that a hell of a lot of purchases fortunes won't matter
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.120]   Well swiping is going away. I think
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.200]   Yeah, how are you gonna pay for a restaurant check? I mean, how are you gonna do with those?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.360]   Oh, they just get this these new touch terminals everywhere. Yeah. Well, that's a big deal
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:37.200]   Every restaurant every waiter in the camera mandated to I think they're mandated to this is uh, this is all changing
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.680]   Is it is it that definite so we're moving to chip and sign
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.560]   Instead of chipping by october of this year, uh, no more swipe
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.520]   So there'll be a chip
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.440]   But it won't be necessarily pin based you'll still maybe sign so that sounds like you the waiter will if he comes to your table
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.880]   Will have a thing that you touch your i'm getting a new american express card. It's on its way with a chip in it
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.080]   I think all your credit cards will be replaced in the next few months with chips
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:11.040]   That's I think nfc right you tap it and then it registers it still may have to print out a receipt and sign it
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.640]   Although it's not a it doesn't mean you can't do chip and pin
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.840]   It just means that they're giving them a little more time to get used to that notion
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.240]   So chip and sign though is by october
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.920]   Yeah, and it may be chip and pin in many many of the places you go
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.520]   Well, so uh, that's to fight fraud. Although we'll see how well that fights fraud. Yeah, um
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.720]   But that but that's why everybody and their brothers announcing these new payment systems
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.120]   Samsung and apple and everybody else because
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.600]   Walmart
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.040]   Because they they realized that that all of the terminals are going to be refreshed in the next six months
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   Right. This is a huge opportunity real opportunity
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   Everyone's trying to take advantage of it
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.840]   Absolutely android pay even exists sundar pachai talked about android pay
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.680]   Uh to to replace google wallet, which is not to tie in with google wallet
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:06.080]   Okay, yeah, it's because that would get really confusing and which actually wouldn't wouldn't be too surprising knowing google
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   But yeah, it's more it's more like uh apis for developers to allow developers to kind of tie
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.920]   Mobile payments like this so they're not gonna their apps and services. I'll still be able to use my wallet, right?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.080]   um
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   So it will provide a secure
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.320]   store it will
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.080]   Have an api
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.720]   Apps will determine when and where you can use payment cards
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.920]   Uh, the google system will tokenize card numbers much like apple and sam san pay do
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.760]   That's one of the real advantages of these payment systems from the privacy point of view
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.400]   And a security point of view you're not giving the merchant your credit card or any personal information
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.800]   merely a one-time token
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.320]   Which they can use to verify that you are paying this amount
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.120]   um
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.480]   Google's android pay will use nfc for transmission will support biometric authentication via hardware
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.160]   Oh, that's another thing on the s6 they figured out a way to do it. Oh, yeah, touch without swiping touch id fingerprint
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:07.600]   Right now although I have to say i've gotten used to the note for and i'm pretty consistent on it
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.840]   But see I just did it and said no no you didn't you do it a little sideways you have to do it just right
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.360]   I do like this and it does unlock google wallet it unlocks last pass
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.080]   So they're already is a standard kind of api for for the sam san
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.600]   fingerprint reader, but you don't want that works like apples where you just put your finger on it and it reads it and you're done
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.440]   Apples works so well. Yep, but you know what leo you know what I don't want on my next s6 a button
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:38.400]   Right. Well as a result you have a physical button and uh, this is why the app all the iPhone is a physical button
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.000]   That's why sam san it justifies sam san's continued to finally does yeah to the home button, right
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.640]   Maybe they knew so pachai said that they're not trying to compete with sam san's offering. It's just to give
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.920]   them
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.760]   another choice
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.160]   Uh, and I guess it will work with a sam san fingerprint reader, which is cool. No timeline
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.840]   I guess we'll find out more at google.io in may
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.400]   I'm glad that they're stepping this up a little bit. I mean for a while it was unsure
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.640]   I was unsure certainly I think a lot of people were what was going to happen with google wallet
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.240]   You know, was it just going to go away?
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.160]   I mean I was really starting to wonder because my I use google wallet whenever I can because it's more secure
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.400]   Um people ask me why do you do that thing with your phone? Why don't you pay my credit card and I tell them I get there's a pin
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.040]   You know, I can revoke things very easily if someone gets my phone or something
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.800]   but um
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.480]   I've been going to stores and it and it hasn't been working because stores are are I guess not subscribing to the service anymore or whatever
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.920]   Uh, so I was getting really worried, but I'm really glad that they're stepping this up
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.280]   I'm glad that they bought
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.200]   Isis or whatever it's called now
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.080]   Softcard, thank you
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.600]   um
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.160]   Because I think that and I think that they I think the reason they did it was just because they got so worried with apple pay
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.640]   Um, I think that kind of forced worried or they saw an opportunity. I mean I think that
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.720]   Uh, just as we said, this is the time if you're going to put your flag in the sand
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:02.800]   This is the time to plan it. Yep. Um, I you know wallet was hurt because the carriers chiefly verizon
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.520]   Uh wanted to use softcard, right?
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.280]   I said well, we're not going to let you use apple
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   I mean how many times have I installed google wallet or tried to on an android device and it says your to your carrier does not support it
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.400]   Yeah, but that changed at some point now everybody does right?
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:23.600]   Have you had problems with your why I have not had problems, but I run a custom ROM so so you wouldn't even know what you do
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:30.080]   Yeah, google actually specifically took took it into their own hands and changed the way wallet
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.440]   Okay, um
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.640]   Authenticated fixed of the secure elements something along those lines
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.600]   The details are a little shady, but they they basically went around the carriers
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.480]   Is that okay? Well, if you're gonna block it there then we're gonna do it this way now
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.320]   It would ever happen. I was real thrilled because something my wallet was working and I put all my credit cards in there
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.200]   Right as far as I can tell it's functionally identical to apple pay the only difference is the fingerprint reader
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:57.040]   I think it's great use a pin instead of a fingerprint reader and now that's coming and everywhere that uses apple pay it works
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.240]   Because touch ID is touch ID, you know or whatever it is. Yep touch to pay is touch to pay
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:08.560]   Um, so i'm not sure what's going on and this is not good because consumers need to know
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.600]   With some reliability what's going on?
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.120]   Maybe that's why they've it almost feels like they've rebranded google wallet android pay
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.480]   In the same way they rebrand a google tv android tv
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:27.840]   Maybe google likes to rebrand its things. Well, it's all android right? Yeah, I think that's the that's the more consumer friendly brand
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.600]   Yeah, right
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:35.040]   They know android. Yeah, people know android. Yeah google wallet. That sounds scary. Oh, no people trust google
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.680]   But they well and they went and remember they went the opposite direction when it came to the market, right?
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.840]   It was always android market and they said oh but that's too limiting with our bigger brand is google
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.320]   So we need to open it so let's make a google play. So they're going in all sorts of different directions
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.800]   That's that's google in a nutshell right there android pay
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:58.320]   I'm being told by the chairman is basically an api. Yeah, and in fact sam san pay could in fact incorporate it could be built on top of android pay
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.960]   So it's just an api
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.200]   gdc will talk about that
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:09.280]   We're done with mobile world right anything else to talk about just a did your correspondence touch the uh, how way he
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   way
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:19.040]   Wow sapphire display first it's an android wear watch though, right? So yeah functionality
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.520]   It's got to be the same here's cnets video of it. It's nice. Look watch though pretty
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.600]   Do they say a price? Yeah, it's not a premier. Am I getting an ad?
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.920]   Very appropriate. I'm gonna add it's 1.4 inch circular display 400 by 400 resolution, which is higher actually good
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.800]   Yeah, that's higher than most you it's a little bit small like an ad
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.640]   Uh snap dragon 512 megs of ram four gigs of internal storage heart rate sensor
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.400]   No flat tire no flat tire round is great
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.880]   Yeah, round is great. There's not gonna be a lot of room on my wrist because the apple watch is coming
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.720]   They're gonna announce it on monday and ship it in uh, yeah two risk ankle. Yeah, I do have two risks
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.680]   But i'm already wearing a moto 360
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.080]   So here's cnets now that we've gone through the ad
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.960]   cnets first look here
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.720]   Scott stein is yeah, so no no flat tire
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.680]   You know the problem with android wear is every is
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.120]   The outside may be different the insides always the same right?
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.560]   But that I guess that's not necessarily a problem in case you know what you're getting sapphire crystal on the screen
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   I think is is a good move already on my moto x i'm getting these little scratches because it turns out when you're walking and stuff
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.360]   As clumsy as I am you run into things
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.840]   Yeah, I don't see any scratches on my I don't either yet. No, I'm one to dispatch
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.080]   Yeah, I think they're definitely going for a little bit of the higher end. Yeah, look at the band
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.280]   It's got a million a's. I think that's very smart of them to go for a hey look
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.000]   Watch is typically a higher end purchase for most people. So let's go ahead and incorporate some higher end features
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.040]   A little bit smaller. So it may it's still really thick but a little bit smaller. So it may appeal to
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.360]   um
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.480]   Women more than than the huge moto right watch. So I mean I think it's um
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:04.320]   It looks fantastic to me. I'm I'm really seriously looking at this as a potential potential watch to buy
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:10.000]   So bummed that the apple watches is iOS only because it is have to switch back to iPhone
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.040]   And I've really become fond of android. We have one of the stories that that
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.280]   uh
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.480]   It's the opposite problem though if your ios o s that you can use android google is going to
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.000]   Supposedly make it make an app so you can use android wear with your ios phone. You want the opposite
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.200]   Right you want to hold on your android phone and have an apple watch, which I think makes sense too
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.640]   Well, you know the one watch that serves them all is pebble
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:44.560]   Yeah, and they made some big announcements including they are now the most successful kickstarter camp
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:50.480]   You went back to the well and they got what 15 million so far for the color
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:57.920]   Uh pebble all these things we saw and uh, uh, mana pomber is at 13 granda song on um patreon
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.000]   Shh
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   It's a crowd sourced. We're old

[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.560]   Uh because they've added this service called grid games. I don't know if you talked about it like steam
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.440]   These are online. So so you've been able for a while to stream games from your home pc
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.840]   Right like on live kind of this is like on live so you can actually stream games over the internet
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.320]   So even though the shield is actually pretty hefty
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.520]   Device it's still only an arm processor. It's not it's not as you know hardcore as your pc
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.920]   So the server renders the gaming
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.480]   Uh off site and then streams it to you exactly exactly that's the way it works
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.520]   And we can try to load this up as we're talking about it, but I mean this is kind of
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.800]   This could be a disruptor especially with a company like
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.400]   Nvidia behind it, right? It's not a startup people know what this is
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:38.320]   Um, they're familiar with the Nvidia brand. So which is it the the shield tablet or the grid games the grid games right now are in beta
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.560]   So i'm sure these things will be relatively cheap right like 10 bucks a month or something
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.280]   I mean they haven't really announced pricing, but if you if you have a shield tablet, you can actually
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:54.320]   Um try this out right now. I'm going to launch trying to what's really cool about this is it analyzes your network
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.480]   Um and it takes a look at wifi all the way out to the internet and says
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.280]   Um, you know, is it working or not? Now I know that we've had a little bit of issues
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.920]   At the breakouts
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.120]   It's not good not so you do have to have enough bandwidth and low latency to play a game because it's
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:16.000]   It's coming streaming in effect from the internet. Yeah, we can try to that's all right. We can try to
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.760]   We can connect and see but yeah, so that all it is is it streams and then this plays local games pretty well, too
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.360]   Right. I mean that's the point of this. Oh, absolutely it plays local local games great
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.600]   Um, and i've actually used it to play to do the streaming from my pc
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.400]   And what I do is I bring the tablet out to the living room
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.920]   Plug it in because it's got hdmi out. I plug it into the tv in the living room
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.600]   So instead of having some having to connect from the living room back over to the to to my study where my games are running
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.840]   Um, I can just bring my tablet in there. That's cool
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.440]   And then I pull in my controller and then you're just it's like you're really gaming
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.360]   Yeah, you go pulling your controller and then you're just you know, you're playing away. Wow
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.400]   Um
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.760]   And the controller is really built really well. We've done reviews on this book. So shield it turns out is not just this device
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.320]   It's a name for products from invidia. They're gonna have a whole line. Yeah, yeah
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:09.280]   they announced the uh, the shield tv, which is a 200 dollar android tv set top box
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.160]   Um, they announced it at gdc
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:20.480]   They called it a combination of a revolutionary tv gaming console and supercomputer. Okay. That's not overselling it too much
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.000]   But the streaming games, I think are a big part of that right so you'll be able to do the same thing that you're doing the same thing
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.480]   With that device that device looks really really nice actually. I mean i'm so i'm
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.840]   More and more i'm disappointed with my nexus player. I know
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.720]   You know people people typically don't like it. I've been using it. We still use it every day
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   But basically only to do netflix
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.680]   Um because it's really unreliable it disconnects from wifi
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.560]   I think having a solid device like this that you can hook up to your tv
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.800]   Stream games either from your pc or from the gaming service
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:58.640]   Uh the grid gaming service. I mean, I think it's really tremendous and then i'm also you know excited because since I own the the controller
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   You know, I can just use the controller
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.360]   Um to run the games. I don't have to get anything else. So it's they're building an ecosystem
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.400]   Um, and I think free grid subscription
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.360]   Where you can rent games or like games, right?
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:16.000]   And then there's a paid one that's the all you can play version. Yep, do either
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.280]   You can do either one stream is 1080p 60 frames a second
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:25.200]   That's interesting and the tv device is supposed to be able to stream 4k to your to your 4k tv
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.760]   Now it is more expensive than a lot of it's $200, but that's still cheap
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.840]   Right. It's more expensive than a steam box. Exactly. That's what I was just going to say. It's cheaper than a pc
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.560]   It's cheaper than a concert. Yeah, it's three or an xbox one exactly
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.480]   So and it's supposed to be more powerful than an xbox 360 for example
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.280]   Um in terms of because they're using I believe the x1
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:51.840]   Uh chip the new chip. This is the new tegra the new tegra. It will even be faster. That's a 64 bit chip. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice to see in vidia
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.280]   Capitalizing a little bit on their chip technology that they've worked so hard on for all these years
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.840]   Building the graphics cards and everything. It's really nice to see them coming around and saying hey look, you know
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:08.800]   We can build devices that can compete based on our and in the chip really is the thing that makes the difference between this and other boxes
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.880]   So look for that in may
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.440]   The grid service will probably launch at the same time. It's in beta right now
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.240]   Um
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.840]   Good news. I think that's that's pretty cool. What else is going on at gdc
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:30.000]   Um google has launched player analytics and custom native ads for great. Yeah, just what we want game developers
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.760]   You know, they're gonna monetize us everywhere and here's something called nearby connections
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.560]   This is exciting. This is a feature that turns phones and tablets into a controller for your
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.280]   Android tv game
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:49.200]   Protocol will be in an update to google play service. They're gonna highlight beach buggy racing
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.360]   There they are beach buggy right there all using basically their
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.200]   Looks like their devices as controllers for looks like a wee you
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.800]   And they looks like almost like they're playing mario car
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.880]   I was just this is what you want to do with your wife, right is be able to play games together
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   I want to play games with my wife. Yeah, no lisa
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.480]   um
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.840]   Because you know both her son and I are gamers
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.160]   And I have an xbox one. He has every game device known a man
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.080]   They play a lot of games and she feels left out. She says I want to play games
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.840]   And I we yeah, I was mentioning this on windows weekly there
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.400]   I couldn't find any really good cooperative games call of duty style games for the xbox one
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.440]   But the nintendo is loaded with them. So we got a wee you and we're doing and that looks so much like mario car
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.520]   It's fun. Yeah, it's a great game by the way
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.160]   Card eight no no. Sorry beach buggy race. Oh, which is what they're playing on the android tv
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.000]   And the funny thing is the wee you basically is a kind of clunky tablet
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.920]   Yeah, uh along with a wee and this is why i have a clunky tablet. You've already got an android device
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:57.040]   Right use that exactly and that's great. Yeah, I think it's I think it's awesome
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.280]   I mean they're really capitalizing on the fact that the ubiquity of android phones and devices
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:07.520]   and doing something a little bit different with them and um, you know, I don't personally like to use my phone as a controller
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.360]   I've done it before
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.800]   With other things I don't but it's there and and not just the controller aspect, but if you look at um
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.560]   Just dance for example with their integration with chromecast
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:23.360]   Um, you know everyone can just if they've got an android phone they can pull it out load up the app and they can all participate
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.760]   On the chromecast connected to your tv
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.200]   Um, and I see this taking this just a step further and I think it's I think it's great. It's bringing a wee like experience
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:37.280]   Uh into the living room without having to buy the the console and get get sucked in so to speak into the
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:44.080]   Into the uh nintendo verse or the the microsoft verse or the sony verse depending on what console you you choose
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.480]   So now I want to know where I can get an android tv
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.880]   Is it in the tv sets or people putting in their tv sets?
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.520]   No, I mean you could get an exes player that has it
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:43:00.720]   Exes is android tv. Exes player is android tv. Um, this and sony the video of device that we just talked about that sharp
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.880]   Others are making those
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.760]   Nice
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   Uh, here's the nexus
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.440]   So, uh, maybe I should get this that's that's an android tv device that will
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.880]   when is this come uh that I can play games and
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.840]   Do all that stuff
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.000]   The update that they're talking about
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.640]   Yeah, oh, uh, well you can get the next player. Yeah, you can get the next part
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   I'm able to do all this gaming stuff. This is my I want to play uh
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.720]   Available in an upcoming update to me. I play serf. We don't know. Yeah, it says uh, it's available in limited beta
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.000]   Huh
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.200]   But allows select partners like a target display. Oh, that's the ad thing
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.520]   So soon but leo especially because what you're talking about is doing gaming
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.640]   I probably wouldn't recommend you get the nexus players. It's not enough juice get that maybe get this invidious
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:56.160]   It's a little underpowered and even worse. It has eight gigs of storage which after system stuff leaves you with basically five
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.320]   Now the video we should point out only a 16, but it does have the ability to expand storage
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:06.000]   Right. It has an external SD card. Yeah, so um, all right. Maybe I'll go maybe I'll wait till may
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.080]   Yeah, yeah, Mars worm in the chat room. That's right. Razor has another one. That's the same cost $100
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.520]   Uh, that is definitely from a specs perspective better than the nexus for
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.720]   tv
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.320]   And google cast is the underlying technology for all of this right that i'm able to use uh
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.200]   cast
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.040]   To interface with this so this looks like a good one too. Razor is a gaming company. Yep. They even make a controller who who
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.200]   I like razor products. I still use my razor. Razor booms legs remember the booms lying the booms lying
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.840]   I still have a razor booms lying. Yeah
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.120]   I mean good stuff. I mean it's pricey, but it works. Yeah, so
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.360]   All right. Well, I think we have to what do you have which one do you have?
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.080]   Jason
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.440]   Oh, you got it working?
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.040]   Oh, he's got the grid stuff working on his shield. All right. Oh, this is the lego
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.880]   So this is streaming from grid
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.760]   Uh, well actually start this is a cutscene right now, but it's going to stream the game
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:12.320]   And that's the supercomputer in the tagline. This is a computer is not this. It's the thing it's connected to which is the server
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:17.040]   Right, uh, but it's going to stream down lego harry potter and you're gonna be able to play it
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.560]   I don't know if i'm gonna be able to play it because I paired this with mine. This isn't mine. Yeah, I did already
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:28.000]   So now I have to we have to do a review on all of these we got to buy all these new
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:35.040]   Android tv things so not the nexus you have that already Jason you say that's too clunky next player
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:39.440]   Yeah, I'm not a I'm not a huge fan of the player. Maybe the forged tv or maybe the in video
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.160]   I have to say in videos got the inside track because uh, they make chips
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.600]   It's a little more expensive, but I'd say it's probably worth that extra price
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.480]   Is the forged tv available yet? No
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.520]   So and nothing you want is available now
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.480]   All right, and apparently she's coming soon also from sharp
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.520]   TP vision
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.520]   And even sony's getting into this game sony who made the original
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.520]   Google tv remember is going to make a brovia
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.880]   television set with android tv built into it
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:21.120]   I don't know. We'll see what's the way it's network interference our calm cast our calm cast has been
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.560]   So you're not playing this on the shield you're playing this on the server right she'll just
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.200]   streaming it down to you
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.880]   On live when out of business nobody acquired those assets, right? This is not on live
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:42.320]   That's a good question. I'm not sure whatever happened on rids been around for a year or two. Yeah, they I think they just yeah network's not going to help us
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.720]   That's the problem there there you have it
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.560]   Illustrated
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.320]   Problem with that idea
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:57.040]   GDC is going on right now the game developers conference. It's a fun event. I think next year we should go down and do a gdc
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.680]   That'd be a lot of fun
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:06.960]   Interesting one of the complaints about the nexus six. I don't know if you've noticed this jeff or or if you've noticed it
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.520]   um Jason, but the nexus six was encrypted by default
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:18.640]   So when you got it it was encrypted and a lot of people complained that that's really slowed down file access on the device
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.040]   Google has
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   Decided not to do that anymore. Google is not going to encrypt new lollipop pop devices by default
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.240]   But it may be required in future versions of android so get ready
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:37.360]   Um, they very quietly have backed down. I think that they acknowledged in fact
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:44.240]   They saw we saw the benchmarks as a huge differential speed. Yeah on the nexus six because of that encryption
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.800]   It's because there is an encryption hardware built into it. Right. You know what I never really noticed it
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.600]   You notice it in a benchmark. It wasn't like I was sitting there running. Yeah. Oh my gosh. This is slow
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.200]   But it does well, I should have been a choice anyway from the beginning, right?
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.680]   I mean, it's okay to pop up and say would you like to encrypt your device?
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.000]   You know, you may notice a small you can't and that's and it's always allowed you to do that
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.120]   Um, you go into the settings you can't use uh, you have to have a passcode
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:14.400]   You know, either a longer number or a password, but then you can encrypt which I recommend
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.080]   because um, you know, otherwise that data is all visible
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:22.960]   Uh, it's unencrypted when the phone is on though. So remember you have to turn it off for best
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.600]   Stolen or something like that. You're you're protected
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.080]   But ours technica notes that that new moto e we're talking about which is one of the first
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.440]   Non google lollipop devices is unencrypted
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:39.760]   Uh, the new galaxy s6 demo units at the mobile world congress not encrypted according to ours
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   Review editor ron amadeo
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.640]   It appears I cannot turn off encryption. No on the six you have to root it
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:51.040]   And modify it and it's a little shaky on that
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.200]   So, um google has backed down a little bit
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:01.520]   It needs to support full description, but it doesn't have to have it turned right on. That's the key
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.920]   It should be enabled
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.160]   Should be but doesn't have to be
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:12.720]   It is very strongly recommended that you do it according to google as we expect this to change to must
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:20.400]   In future versions of and right but that's fine as long as future hardware supports it with hardware decryption. Yep
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.720]   And you have fast mmc or something faster in the storage
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.760]   Um
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.960]   Yeah, and it's important to note too that encryption affects compression
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.160]   Uh, once you encrypt something
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.800]   You can't compress it random you can't compress it really at all because yeah, the data's basically been scrambled
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.000]   Yeah, so there's no duplicate data to compress. Yeah, um
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.080]   Uh
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.320]   Okay, we're gonna take a break and then it'll be change log time
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.400]   Yes, we're bringing back the change log
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:59.440]   Just a moment. Actually, there's a couple more things from gdc. We'll talk about too
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.080]   Just looking down the run man run down

[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   Time for all the googoo change log
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.640]   I uh was shocked when I went to contacts dot google.com
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.600]   And I said, what is this?
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.320]   I don't know we should don't show. Yeah, I won't show it. I was gonna show all my phone numbers and everything
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:31.840]   But if you are a google contacts user, you might want to go there and take a look at it. It's pretty sweet
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.920]   What do you guys think?
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.880]   Yeah, I just brought it up today. It does look pretty nice. It's a lot nicer than the old one. Uh right away you notice that the
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   um
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:46.800]   The they've separated. I don't know whether this is virtual or in reality, but you know contacts used to be under gmail
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.160]   You click on contacts and would still be in gmail, but you contacts would show
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:55.600]   Well, it looks like they're perhaps separating contacts out a little bit as a separate app because now it's under context
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.400]   On google.com. Well, it's always been there, but it but it so I know that's always goes back to gmail though, right?
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.280]   Yeah, well, it's the same one as in gmail when I like about this
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.680]   Uh, they've separated into stard and frequently contacted, which is nice
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.160]   I think that some of the phones did that and the first thing I say you have 86 duplicate contact
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.560]   Right would you like to merge them? That's new. Yep. Yep. Someone pops right up
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.600]   Which is great. Yeah, this has been a problem people have complained about for a long time
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.720]   The fact that you know your contacts come from all these different sources and you end up with five versions of your contacts
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:30.320]   It's such a nice. Yeah, it really does it very nicely and it did it instantly. Oh my god. I've been waiting for this
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.360]   So again, this is something some like
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.480]   Some phone operating systems offered you. I think a samsung might have but boy it did that a night
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:45.520]   It did that nicely. It did it beautifully. Mm-hmm. Um, so I don't got it. It's been how many how long since they've updated contacts
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.960]   I use it like crazy. So highly recommended
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.200]   Also
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.400]   Yes, the preview. I just just gonna say that the preview if you go to contacts. I google.com/preview
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:01.200]   You should be able to check it out. Ah and and it doesn't work with apps accounts. I believe yet
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.840]   That's why I was moaning. Yeah, all right. Yeah
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.400]   So sorry sorry for your life. Sorry for your losses. If you have a gmail account, it should work
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.360]   So jim, you just don't use your regular gmail account
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:18.400]   No, I use my apps account which and for god's sake those are the professionals and that's work and all that
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.840]   I just can't I do not understand how they make a second class citizens
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:28.000]   I don't I don't understand it a and b. I'm sorry. I've complained about this before but even when I'm not signed in
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.280]   To my gmail account anywhere. I'm signed into my apps account
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:37.600]   It is my account when I open a new window for various things it switches to my gmail
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.960]   Yeah, I'm not signed in at all. It's which is to my gmail
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.840]   So sometimes when I try to open a document somebody sent me a document
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:49.680]   I can't open it because it keeps on insisting no Jarvis. You're gonna open this in the account where you can't open it
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.760]   You're gonna open it in gmail
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:58.320]   Yeah, that is annoying and I what I found is that I get really good at changing the URLs to go to my second third or fourth user
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:04.480]   Um that's signed in just so that I can get back to the feature that I wanted that I wanted to do originally because it always defaults
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   So that you zero user
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.440]   Um, and so yeah, I find myself getting really good at hacking the URLs just to get to the right would you do it?
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:17.120]   Seriously, would you do a little tutorial on that? Oh, yeah plus thing and I I'd killed to have that
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:23.440]   Yeah, absolutely. And you know the thing about this is that's on and soon-dars in charge of both on android
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:30.160]   It's easy as pie to go back and forth from accounts. It doesn't doesn't confuse the phone. It doesn't confuse the OS. It works really well
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.280]   Uh within the applications you can easily switch
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:39.360]   Uh, I'm stuck. I would just kill my my gmail account entirely and and switch my google plus
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:44.000]   To my apps, but I have grandfather and stuff all of my
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.160]   um
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.760]   Play store stuff is on my gmail account. Yep
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.200]   And if you switch it over you lose all your stuff. So I'm stuck. I can't do it. I'm sorry for the rant
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:00.000]   But uh, no, it's a big problem. I completely agree with you and I wish that
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.640]   You know, I was hoping that when they brought out inbox that that would be the the mer
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.760]   I wasn't so
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.640]   Thrilled with the features of inbox, but I was really thrilled because I thought it was going to merge all of my apps and my
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.120]   All of my mail accounts, you know
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:18.720]   Five six seven different mail accounts that I have I thought oh now I have one place to go to read all my mail from all my accounts
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:24.880]   Nope. Sorry. You're an apps user. You can't use the inbox yet. So you know, oh, oh, you know what Aaron now
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.520]   I'm really stuck. So now when I go to contacts
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.920]   Yeah, it insists on taking me to the preview in my gmail account. I can't get
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:37.920]   To the contacts in my apps account at all now. That's not good. Yep. I cannot switch you're not allowed to switch accounts
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:43.840]   I'm stuck. I now can't get to contacts in apps. Hello google. Did anybody there listening? Hello?
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:49.120]   Oh boy. Yep. Oh, there there there. No, okay. Now it came up now
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.680]   See they fixed it already
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.360]   And that's quick and I tried it and then it says 404 error
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:00.240]   Because it's assisting on now stuck in with the preview because it won't show in the preview
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.600]   Google
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:08.240]   So here's another one that's I guess uh, maybe a way to get you to upgrade you're a smartphone
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:13.520]   Uh, remember there's an issue with early versions of the google browser not chrome
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:17.360]   But the google browser that came in andro the aos aosp browser
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.200]   Uh, it's not secure and google says we're not fixing it. Mm-hmm
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.160]   Uh, and that's that's been the case for some time if you're using when did that when
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:32.720]   When did they eliminate that browser? I think it was in kitcat or maybe even must have been kitcat
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:39.120]   Yeah, pretty sure easy to count. Mm-hmm, but the fix for a long time for pre kitcat phones was to get
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:44.800]   Uh chrome you just download chrome and just don't use the built-in browser use chrome
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:51.040]   Chrome 42 will be the last version to support ice cream sandwich or earlier
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:57.120]   So you'll still have chrome, but no more fixes after chrome 42. I think we're at version
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.000]   40 right now
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.480]   So there'll be a an update or two
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:07.920]   Let me see uh the last version for ics is currently slated to arrive
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   In mid-April you will not get
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.040]   Anymore releases after that
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:17.840]   43 and above will not work on ice cream sandwich of course the version you have
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:23.200]   Will continue to work, but it may not be secure and don't go back to the the browser built in
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.520]   To uh earlier on earlier version of android because it's really not secure
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:34.720]   So uh go to jelly bean at least kitcat lollipop all of them will continue to have support for chrome
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:40.000]   This is something kind of new in the google space. You know microsoft and apple have always done that
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.920]   um
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.720]   You know after a certain amount of time an operating system dies
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:50.400]   Google's problem with operating systems with android is there's too many versions in use all the time
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.000]   Um, maybe this is one way they can push that along
[00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.160]   But i'm assuming that you know, that's only i'm looking at the graph here that uh shows the the usage
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.560]   It looks like there's only 5.9 maybe maybe a total of 13 percent of the
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.600]   Of the user base is using ice cream sandwich and below but that's tens of millions of people
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.800]   It's a lot of people but i thought it was going to be a lot higher than i so
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.800]   I'm surprised it's that low that's good
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.960]   And maybe those people will finally get a new phone well or just switch to dolphin or
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.600]   One of the other right you could use another browser
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.040]   You don't have to use chrome right?
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.200]   Problem is they don't they're not going to know that right? Yeah
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.520]   uh by the way htc is making a
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:52.400]   Virtual reality head so we talked about the g
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.680]   With this this is a true standalone it's like the oculus rift and stone screens and all that stuff
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.240]   You know it makes it more expensive
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.240]   You're the gamers i'm not
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.800]   Is is this stuff going to be a big market? No
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.000]   But i'm i'm alone in saying that
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.480]   Look, what do you think you're no i mean i i
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:16.800]   There's potential here and i think that's why everybody's into it right and there's potential facebook spent billions to acquire
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.720]   This rift yeah sam's doing it htc's doing it
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:28.400]   Here's my take on it it is for gaming i guess because it's immersive and in games you do want to mark you want to when you're playing call do you
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   Want to be on the battlefield
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:37.200]   But we talked about this one with us weekly i'm so much more excited about hollow lens and augmented reality and google by the way has a solution for that
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:45.120]   Um they've acquired companies and they're developing very rapidly an augmented reality solution augmented reality means you still see the world around you
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:52.400]   But superimposed upon it in the glasses right are things whether they're menu items controls a game you're playing
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:58.240]   Um and i like that more like a heads-up display and also able to see infinitely right i mean you can see
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:05.600]   Infinitely i was just talking to some friends of mine from our local makerspace and they're actually uh their company designs
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.480]   They've they've worked on the james web telescope and and some other things so they're they're into
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.240]   ocular technology right and they were saying that the
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.480]   You know the true the benefit here is more in the heads-up display and the in the ability to look out infinitely
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:26.320]   I think so um as opposed to these you know oculus rift type things that are a little bit limited and make you sick
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:32.480]   Make you sick and they seal you in a room where you just you know you go to another place and you're sitting there a sitting duck
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.280]   For burglars. Mm-hmm. I don't like that. I don't know why i'm so proud
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.600]   This is a deal with valve that they're doing and these are 1080 dual 1080p screens
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   Which are more than we've seen so far
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:51.840]   And yeah, nicholia didn't gadget actually had a pretty great review of it today and just explained her entire experience with it
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.320]   And you read that get sick?
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:59.840]   No, she didn't get sick in fact she walked away from it and basically said this device has convinced me on vr
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.240]   I was very skeptical going in and this particular experience is vr done right
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.680]   Which is so much just that when they saw the oculus rift right?
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.960]   But but you know the oculus rift also, I mean from what I understand kind of a lower res
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.120]   Display and I think as far as vr is concerned
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.840]   It's all about immersion and being able to escape your reality right or something else
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.040]   If you can get that view to be as clear and crisp as it sounds like we're kind of heading
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.720]   Then it becomes a pretty revolutionary step I think in in the success of this type of technology
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.920]   I think it says something too that the fact that valve has bought into this right
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.720]   I mean because they've been investigating this type of technology for years
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.920]   And the fact that they've chosen to maybe you know put the with their skin in the game with this device
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.040]   I obviously interesting is valve
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:53.120]   Jerry Ellsworth was working for valve when she created their cast AR which is an augmented reality
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.200]   Yeah, gaming solution and when she was fired from valve along with lots of other people
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.440]   She went to gave no one said can I keep cast AR and she and he said yeah
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.360]   We don't want it
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.920]   So valve probably at that point had made the decision. We're not going to go for augmented reality
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.280]   We're going to go for virtually
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.960]   And I think vr makes sense in gaming. I do think it's makes sense in it because it's an immersive thing although
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.360]   Minecraft in the holland's looked pretty dang awesome
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.760]   Um, so htc and valve are making the vibe
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.120]   Be interesting to play. I mean, I'd be fun to play portal
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:33.600]   Yeah, uh in this thing. We're going to skip the xfinity ad here real quickly
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.360]   Given that the Comcast is killing our bandwidth today
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.960]   Uh, let's see
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.520]   I mean vr could be as big of a
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:49.360]   As big of a deal as gaming kind of has been right gaming has always been for the for the longest time
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.920]   It's been this kind of passion passionate
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.800]   Uh, you know, a section of technology that a good number of people are into but you know
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.840]   It's just the kids they're into the gaming and blah blah and now it's it's overwhelmingly mainstream
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.360]   vr has be more too like you could go to paris
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:11.520]   You could yeah, yeah, and that would be neat. I just huge gaming a peripheral
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.720]   Well, it's also going to be expensive right now
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.680]   I've broken the stream
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.960]   Somehow broke. I mean ultimately we all want the holodeck right. I mean that's not how that would be vr
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.160]   Yeah, except wait a minute. Well, no way it could be a are well
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.360]   Well, would it because the holodeck you're in it you're in it
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   And you're moving around in it and it was a room right it wasn't a you weren't you weren't lying in a chair with a helmet on
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.680]   Right, right. You were physically moving through space. Right. So it's the technology doesn't exist is what it just doesn't exist yet
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.680]   But I think ar is closer though, right?
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.600]   Because ar can take those lines on the wall and then paint over those with something
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.440]   Different, right? I think the really ultimately vr isn't gonna work until you jack in
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.000]   Yeah, if I can jack into the meta
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:00.240]   Then maybe I'll play your silly little game
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.520]   This is pretty interesting though also to see htc kind of spreading its wings a little bit
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.840]   Right being like, you know, we've we've kind of struggled
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.560]   We've made great hardware people love us for our hardware, but we've still ended up struggling in the smartphone
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.720]   Tablet space
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:21.120]   Let's try this new kind of emerging trend right now and just make it specta you know partner with uh valve, which they've done
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.600]   um interesting stuff
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.600]   What do you guys think of the new google campus?
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.600]   Are you excited about it or I want to go there?
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:38.880]   Isn't jeff isn't there kind of an axiom in the business that when you start building the massive corporate headquarters
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.400]   That's the sign that it's the beginning of the end well apple too
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.040]   Um, you know what what you know what kind of bothered me though leo
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.480]   Is that i've been in the buildings there are absolutely fine buildings
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.160]   Those buildings they work many years the waste of creating
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.200]   You know landfill out of carrying down those buildings just just bothered me
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.800]   It's a restored natural habitat around permanent day greek near the proposed landing project
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.240]   And here's the other thing that occurred to me
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:10.800]   So what they're basically doing is putting a dome around the campus so you can't wonder around google anymore as well
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:17.040]   It will be you can uh, it by can you can bicycle inside it
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.560]   Right and we never leave it. It's the bio dome. It's bio dome
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.480]   Remember that yeah, yeah, yeah in there is a robot
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.440]   You know drive by facebook and it's boring as hell outside inside is Disneyland right now
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:35.440]   This is the existing google campus right this is which as you say works fine
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:39.360]   It's a building it's a it's a building with cubies, you know cubbies
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:44.800]   They're gonna hooly it that's what they're gonna do. Yep. Yep. They're gonna turn it into hooly
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:51.120]   They're from what they're describing. They're creating modules like building modules that can move
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:58.000]   So you're working with a team and you want to coordinate with another team your module actually moves to another mod
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.120]   It's like a hamster habitat. What why it's a hamster habitat
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:07.440]   When you're working on the wave team and it disappears you suddenly get ejected
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.880]   You know the helicopter comes down picks up your module and everybody in it takes you somewhere else goodbye
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.680]   The other thing about it is that that you know i've been
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.960]   Now i've gone to enough google stuff out there where you end up across
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.040]   101 yeah
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.760]   And people there's a real isolation then you really feel like you're in the kiddie table. Yeah, yeah
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.000]   um
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.880]   All right, the other the other thing is they I think is also included in agreement to build housing
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.480]   And I think that's a how you get these deals done for for the town of mountain view. You mean yeah
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:47.040]   Yeah, that's critical. Yep. And they mentioned that the canopies will also block pollution. Maybe they're planning
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   for uh, you know global warming
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.680]   The end of the year
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:59.440]   I mean, it's like the tv show the dome. Look at this. Yeah, you know, i'll bet i'll bet somewhere in some
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:04.480]   Where there there's a there's there's the zombie scenario how to keep zombies out
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:13.280]   Nor in the geeks if you can but if you can if you can retrofit these buildings and make them more environmentally friendly and save
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.000]   You know, how are these existing buildings under this?
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.200]   No, no, they're turning down. It's all brand new brand new for interning biosphere three. I'm telling you
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.560]   Look at that. They have a giant faucet
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.200]   No, this could just as easily be
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.440]   sculpture
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.440]   Look at the water there wasting
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.600]   Net zero parking they want to net consolidated parking below the building
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:43.920]   So once you get there they they take your car they crush it and you have to stay
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   Your car will never be seen again
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.200]   It does look beautiful
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.000]   But i'm just saying when companies get this big and this grandiose and they spend this much money like apple
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.800]   Uh that is often the beginning of the end that's often the peaked peak moment
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.960]   Said the guy who built the million dollar studio in downtown
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:09.920]   How long does it take to build something like this like are we talking five years 10 years
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.120]   Yeah, not decades. Oh, yeah, it's not like sakura familia. It's uh,
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.200]   I mean this is um
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.360]   First they got to get approval. That's what this process is getting mountain view to go along with it
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.200]   Apple's campus is I think was a five-year build
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.680]   This can't be that much more compact. I bet it is. I mean only because it's so much bigger
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.920]   And if you if you go for the full view and that full view the full
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.080]   Enchilada that never happens anyway, right? I mean this is a rendering
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.000]   This is something that someone came up with and said here's what it could look like like a concept car
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.760]   It's only a concept. Yeah, it's never going to be like this if they went for the full enchilada
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.320]   I think it would be more than 10 years to get everything done
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.760]   But you're right. That's not going to happen. So yeah, we're probably looking at at five years eight years
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.960]   To get the majority of it done if they choose to go this route
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.760]   I guess they can do it as fast as they want just you know hire more people
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.120]   Yeah, right. You certainly have the money how much you want to spend some of these like that image right there
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.680]   That's why I said it looks like they were repurposing the buildings right?
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.920]   Looks like they've taken the sides off of the buildings. Right. It doesn't look like they're they're completely
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.320]   I like the notion that these canopies
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.360]   Make you that you're outside, but you're also insights
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.720]   Walls in the buildings because it never rains
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.960]   It never you know the climate never varies
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.120]   It is a perfect place to do something like this because it doesn't remember that
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.960]   One of the goals google has is to put its campus entirely on solar be carbon neutral and this might be a
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.600]   Part of that project is why yeah, yeah
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.240]   But they've got there's no that you got to get rid of hobo's
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.680]   Okay, I'm just saying the hobos are gonna love this
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:53.920]   It's so big. I'm just joking, but it is so big. I don't know how you keep it secure. It looks like you can just
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.560]   Like it's not sealed right?
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:02.800]   Oh, no, I'm sure it is is it you have to go through an airlock would imagine that's what that's what it's a vacuum. Yeah
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   So if the planet if all of the
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.040]   Oxygen boils off the surface of the planet still be safe still be okay. Good biosphere three
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.600]   The front door is actually in New York, but then you're
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.800]   All right, uh, what's what's um
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:26.560]   What's the the the the tube the fast tube? Oh the hyperloop or the other hyper
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.280]   There yeah hyper pneumatic thing
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.120]   YouTube has a billion viewers and no profit
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.520]   Uh
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.800]   Amazon has gazillion customers no profit
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:45.360]   The problem is that in order to do youtube you have to spend a lot of money on infrastructure and bandwidth and hardware and
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.000]   uh youtube has revenue
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   Four billion dollars in revenue. That's a
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.280]   One third increased over the year before that
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.800]   But and it's six percent of google's overall sales, but uh, I think we talked about this last week
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.360]   Actually, I don't think google's worried
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   No, youtube is a engine
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.520]   for google
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.040]   Walmart has pulled out of a deal with google over shared data
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.720]   I don't think it's so much an issue of consumer privacy is it is walmart's privacy. Yeah, we want the data
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.840]   Google ended up knowing too much. Yeah, that's our data google
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:28.240]   Uh, so walmart had signed up for google advertising service that showed shoppers where products are available at nearby stores
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:35.760]   But a month later they pulled out over concerns about sharing store inventory and pricing data with google
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.960]   So there you go
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.160]   Uh, i'm just looking at quick. Oh, what's this about google wants to help you build your put put solar in your house
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.360]   Because I want to do that. It's it's the rental deal. I mean, it's it's it's it's not a bad deal right?
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.840]   They own it and it leads it to you and you get the net value bill. Well, this is nothing new their power purchase agreements
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.880]   For many companies do this right exactly. Um, they're just investing more
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:08.880]   This is actually in conjunction with solar city which is a full set of just one of these companies
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.600]   So the yeah, that's a good way to do it picked out the school that I uh serve on the board is
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.000]   Uh thinking about doing this the company comes in they build all the infrastructure
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.800]   They don't pay charge you anything you get effectively free power you save a lot of money and
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.280]   Yes, it's a smart. It's actually a smart for everybody. It's a good
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.920]   New thought now that I have ice damming as I wonder if it helps with snow on the roof
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:38.800]   Oh, man. I in fact, I forgot to ask paul about this. He posted uh, he had a snow clear off his roof
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.560]   He said all sorts of damage and and really leakage and I
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.800]   It's it's I
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.200]   I asked what we had we had guys tear and ice off the roof today. I talked to the making etiquette
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.960]   And he said I said sorry didn't call you back. That's why he said. Oh, yeah. Well, I got somebody in my roof right now
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.880]   Wow
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.400]   Good news in mississippi google was being uh prosecuted by a local district attorney
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.240]   in uh, mississippi actually attorney general mississippi jim hood
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.160]   Uh, and then in the sony pictures entertainment hack
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.920]   Uh
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:15.920]   Emails were released that showed that sony actually had approached hood saying would you mind going after google for us?
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.080]   So
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:29.040]   Judge has decided uh, henry t wingate us district judge has temporarily barred hood from forcing google to supply comply with its
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.360]   His 79 page subpoena saying it was an illegal
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.880]   censorship campaign cooked up by hollywood
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.920]   Agreeing with google the judge said google has the better side of the legal arguments
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:48.400]   Pretty embarrassing frankly hood was trying to figure out if google was violating mississippi laws
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.400]   because
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.760]   By exposing internet users to drugs and pornography
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.560]   Across state lines. He is moving pornography
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.640]   Across our state lines project goliath
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:05.360]   Goliath being google
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.480]   Was revealed in the hack of sony and it was something the mpaa was involved in and
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.680]   They found hood
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.440]   Uh, I can't remember. Oh, yeah
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.320]   They got a previous attorney general from mississippi to lobby hood to do this
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:28.400]   Paying a lot of money. Wow google just but we talked about this on security now just bought the entire dot app domain
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:36.080]   So, I guess I can is selling custom domain names the g tlds
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.200]   uh generic tlds
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.600]   Dot app is one of them dot a p p google spent 25 million dollars
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:50.320]   And uh, they bought a number of them. They've applied for dot docs dot android dot free dot fyi dot food
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:58.160]   No, we're about dot bar who gets that and dot app they uh, I can't has been gradually auctioning these off
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:05.920]   For instance dot tech llc spent 6.7 million on the dot tech domain name last year beating out google
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.360]   Amazon bought dot buy for five million dot spot for 2.2 million
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.880]   Google got dot blog and they say well, we're gonna make it easier for people who i'm blogger dot com
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.120]   to without any uh
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.720]   Domain name fooling around to have a dot blog address
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:28.080]   But the dot app they're gonna keep there. I don't know if they're gonna make that public or keep it to themselves
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.400]   It's another gold rush. I mean
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.600]   We're all old enough to remember this stopping back in the
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:41.440]   90s, right? I mean remember sex dot comm sold for a lot everybody thought that the generic dot com names like tv.com right right
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.360]   And uh, sex dot com was worse business dot com sold for a lot of things and they were worthless because they were generic
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.680]   Yeah, yeah, precisely because they were generic turn out google dot com was worth a lot more
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.880]   Well, the other the other issue of that is that what we found when I worked on newspaper sites is that if you're if you're brand
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.360]   Didn't match your domain you lost all kinds of value because people didn't recall you right?
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:07.200]   But if you're if your domain is generic and you think that's valuable you can't trademark you can't do anything right?
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.880]   right
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.520]   So google because they are a registrar
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:17.200]   Let's you currently register, you know hover does this they have a lot of crazy names google has dot how dot soy
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.160]   dot minna
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.960]   Uh, they want dot dad dot here dot eat dot new
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:29.600]   Um, but but some of them there was I think there was one that they were going to keep to themselves that we're just going to
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.920]   Own it. I can't remember what that was
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.320]   Dot god dot god because they're keeping that to themselves
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.960]   Now that's dot universe
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.040]   Uh, let's see
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.440]   I think it's important to mention so we have the story last week leo
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:49.440]   And we talked about it the fair amount the google was going to ban adult content on blogger and then not very long after the show at all
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.240]   They like the day or two. They decided to reverse that
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:59.280]   Yeah, we had an interesting debate and I mentioned on twit that you got involved in a twit twitter conversation with a pornographer
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.240]   Who said we support it because we we think it's better for us
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:13.360]   Uh, and for kids if all if there's neighborhoods where adult stuff is we if you think about it if you're in the adult business you
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:21.920]   Part of the hassle is all the people trying to you know, sue you away. So, uh, am I characterizing it correctly?
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.800]   That's what that's what he said. Yeah, but then but then um, uh, what's your name blue? Um
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.040]   Oh violet blue
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.800]   Biking violet blue and others had entirely different rationales saying that that that basically
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:40.320]   And I think a lot of it is just people who were just different in life and are going to be
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.680]   Discriminated against because they they got rid of this and and so I'm you know, I think for on a basis of free speech
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.800]   I'm glad it's still there. Yeah, of course. I never look at any of it
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:54.000]   They were very serious completely ever see it by the way Steve Gibson just signed in the chat to tell me that the domain google bot
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   And it's keeping to itself is dot dev
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.480]   dv
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.320]   So if you're a google developer, you'll have your own tld all to yourself. Look at this on street view
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.080]   There
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:11.360]   I don't know. Is there somebody doing zip lines on? Yeah, there is. Yeah, they've got the backpack on
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.920]   He's zip lining through the amazon
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.240]   I don't think I can look at this. I think my problems will sweat. Oh zip lining is fun
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.480]   Of course you would never want to do this. Look at this. He's wearing the backpack on a zip line
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.440]   I would literally have a heart attack halfway down. I just
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:31.040]   It's fun. I've done it in uh, Belize. We we have a zip line up the road apiece in the
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.760]   In the redwood forest up here and it's really fun. I've done a lot of times. It's great fun. My mom did it
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:40.000]   My mom at what 70 she did a couple years from 72 73
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.400]   It's a little sweaty palm, but that's
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:47.120]   It can be especially if you're afraid of heights. You know what scared me more was was the we had to go up
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:51.600]   Uh, we were in Hawaii and and it was the climb up to the top of this huge tree
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:58.320]   The zip line part was no sweat, but the climb up there on this little rope ladder to get up to this, you know, 50 feet in there
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.040]   That was a part. Yeah, we had a belay down. That was scary. Yeah, it was a little disconcerting, but once you're up there
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:06.800]   Jump off here's the thing you'll really like jeff when you're on top of these trees
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.920]   They're you're very high up your hundreds of feet up. They sway about five feet in each direction. Oh, yeah
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.560]   It's like being on the outside of a tall building. Yeah
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.200]   Not that you're gonna have nightmares. There you go. I will name it. I will. I'm sorry
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.840]   I literally might palms are sweaty. Yeah. Wow galvanic skin response. Yeah, I can't do it
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.600]   So a break good times Bradley Horowitz is back running google plus which is great news
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.920]   That is very good news
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.960]   Um
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:45.040]   But but notice the I can't figure out the criminology of the wording of it because he said photos and stream
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.360]   Isn't that weird he he posted this
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.000]   on as google plus
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.920]   He doesn't even use the word google plus by name or mention hangouts
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:58.640]   He calls it photos and streams remember that david best brits had taken over
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.360]   um
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:08.080]   But uh, but Bradley was originally a google plus guy, right? He was part of the original team. I think yeah, we're absolutely
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.680]   Undervic
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.000]   And so the biggest basic thing instead of giving it to Bradley they gave it to best brits
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.160]   And now I guess it's Bradley
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:22.400]   Brown and Bradley is so smart. It's such a good guy and great guy really a great product guy. Love him. Um, yeah
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:28.320]   But photos and streams that tells you almost a little bit about what they see google plus as being
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.080]   Yep, yep, absolutely
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.360]   And I think they're you know
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:38.480]   I think that the photos especially is the one service that everyone universally loves love it because they can just set it and forget it
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:45.840]   All their photos are backed up. Yeah, um, everybody I talked to that it has used the service tells me a story of when they drop their phone in the toilet
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.840]   Or something happened and they were able to get their photos back and how great it is
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.040]   So love it. I love the auto awesomes. Yep. I love the playfulness that they do stuff on
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.680]   You know special days like the uh
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:01.200]   Castle hossum or whatever was
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.560]   They need to do something like that again. That was fun. What was that?
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.880]   Is that April fools whether they did do that? That was a lot of fun. I've got a picture of myself
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.080]   Well, here we go on the couch
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.760]   Leon, he's laying on the couch with his phone and david hasselhoff is next to him
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.960]   What do you what okay Bradley?
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:24.640]   What are you doing in three weeks? April fools coming up? What you gonna do good something good? Okay?
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:30.720]   No more of this toilet internet stuff. That's a waste of your energy do something fun for the users. Okay
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.920]   um
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.560]   Bespers, I don't or is it bebry. I don't know how he pronounces name. I did he
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.480]   I don't know if he changed anything at all. I mean google plus it's just been kind of well
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.760]   He was already yeah, he was in charge of all kinds of engineering stuff, but I think it just was probably
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.880]   I don't know why they didn't I guess it was a whole rank thing. I mean as a friend of mine
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.680]   Cries to convince me that google's like the military
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.480]   And and then there's all these rights
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:04.800]   And so vick, you know was a brigadier a great left. Yeah, you needed a brig brigadier general to replace them
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.760]   but then the truth is that that um
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:13.200]   Google plus is actually like a you know a base in the philippines so
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.200]   Now what's the deal with hangouts? This is also hangouts
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.600]   That's what I can't tell that's what I can't understand and in the um
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.680]   Yeah, uh this article in cnet says it's not yet clear what will happen to hang out the communications feature of google plus
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:35.360]   And the december talk horror. What's said the new leader hangouts is designed as an all-purpose communication tool marrying video audio and text messaging
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.720]   I love hangouts. I live in hangouts. Yep. I do too
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:46.240]   But you know leo and you know i'm google van boy and all that but the fact that i'm now on a mac doing skype kind of hurts
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:52.080]   Because hanging outs, but that's a part of hangouts is the video conversations. I use it for my texting
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.520]   I do too. Yeah, I do that too. It's the default texting and all my android phones
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.320]   I and it because I get desktop texting. I make calls with it. It's my phone call
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.240]   Feature on the desktop. Mm-hmm. And I get google voice is integrated voice basically is
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.080]   I get all my voice mail right there. Yep, and I really love the ability to draw
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.560]   Did you I didn't even know this was possible?
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.880]   You can do drawings in google hangouts. Did you know that I did not know okay?
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.720]   This this is so weird if you hover show up you have phone downs we
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.440]   um
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.600]   Do you know the phone I can do it on my desktop the problem
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:33.200]   Phone numbers. Yeah, so maybe I shouldn't do it on the desktop. Maybe I'll make a new one. Let me let me text
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:40.000]   Uh you erin sure. I don't know if it's gonna show your phone or something. Let's find somebody whose phone
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.400]   Yeah, I think it just shows your email. You don't care about that. Do you?
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.640]   No, no, that's fine. Okay, so here I am. Let's make it a little bit bigger
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.520]   So I can now this is erin nukem. I could video call you
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.640]   I can text you and if I have a phone number for you, it will also allow me to choose sms or hangouts
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.760]   But watch as I hover my mouse over on the right. I didn't know this has been around for more than a year
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.000]   A little pen shows up. You don't see it and now I can draw it to you
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.960]   And that's gonna send that to you and if it's if we're sending text message, it'll send it as an mms
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:24.080]   Isn't that funny? Well, isn't that did you nobody knows that you know, but you do know if I type woot

[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.160]   When you did it, huh?

[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.480]   Is it slash ponies? I thought that yeah, look little ponies are running across your screen
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   Do the happy birthday one again? That's cool. It's fun. There's a bunch of these
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.240]   I'm sure David will add uh Bradley will add more
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:36.080]   That's cool
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:42.960]   Pitchforks. That's the other one p i t s h far k s then the peasants are very angry now. I guess you have to do slash
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.280]   I
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.240]   Guess that's for the big the pitchforks salesman. We're upset
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:55.920]   Here come here. Where a oh you forgot the p. Oh, I spelled it wrong itchforks is an entirely different graphic
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.120]   It's a different kind the title of the show it's works
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:05.360]   Here they go. Here come the natives. Oh, they're mad. Oh, they're mad the peasants are revolting
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.640]   So fun, that's awesome. These are easter eggs in hangouts
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:16.400]   Uh, somebody pointed out they've gotten nicks software and all they've done with it really is make snapstream
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:20.560]   And but they could incorporate that into photos when that'd be awesome
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.520]   Bradley we're expecting big things if you keep up the good work
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.640]   All right, uh anything else before we wrap it up john karmax
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.640]   I mentioned this says samsengal
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.840]   Really be throwing its weight behind your vr who cares
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.440]   Uh apple passes samseng and q4 smartphone sales
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:47.520]   But I think this number is interesting 1.9 billion mobile phones are sold last year of all kinds 1.9 billion
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.240]   in one year in one year
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.760]   What are there seven billion people in the earth? Yeah
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.720]   1.9 billion
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.960]   And uh apparently there's a big problem in canada letting emo arse passed away
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.760]   And uh turns out the five dollar bill in canada
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.800]   Whoever that guy is looks so much like spock
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.520]   That canadians have taken to drawing hair eyebrows and a little Vulcan
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.000]   a little star star fleet symbol on the collar
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.080]   and uh
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.120]   These spocked bills big problems according to the toronto son the bank of canada is urging
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.120]   urging star trek fans to stop defacing
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:32.560]   Currency that is uh canada's seventh prime minister, sir
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.640]   Wilfred laurier who happens to have the strong resemblance
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.440]   To letter knee boy there he is
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.080]   Ah, it's hilarious
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:48.880]   Really is god that takes an eye to see that I wouldn't have seen that right once you've seen it you can't see it. Oh you can't
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.720]   Uh apparently this there's all kinds there's quite a few of them
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.920]   Because everybody does their own take i love it
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.800]   He's doing their own thing. I thought the one we showed first was the best that way because he they did the star
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:03.440]   Star fleet emblum and everything yeah
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.040]   yeah
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.640]   And I and I appreciate that spocking is now a verb spot
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.640]   Spocking your five dollars. That's
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:16.240]   That is a tribute worthy of Leonard nemo. I might I might I might see
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.560]   Uh uber is buying a mapping company
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:27.520]   Uh hbo has set its price for its cord cutting version of hbo go 15 bucks a month
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.280]   A little high well, it's pretty much what you pay for on cable right?
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.200]   I think that's what the the upshot of this is you won't be able to cord cut to save money
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.400]   No, oh no, no, but you can save everything else right?
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.840]   I don't know if if hbo and showtime were available
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:47.120]   I that's that then I would start to consider it. Yeah, but then you're gonna have to pay for your internet
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:52.000]   By the time you add up all the services it's gonna cost exact I guarantee you
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.640]   Yeah, they're gonna get you they're figuring this out right now
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.800]   It's gonna cost you exactly what you're paying now you'll go. Oh, I saved a dollar or maybe it costs a dollar more
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.120]   It'll be so close
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.800]   So I uh, I will I also wonder if I go and threaten a cord cut what they would do
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:11.360]   Uh, they'll do what they did for me and that's I'm now my second year of free hbo nice. There you go. Oh, there you go
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:17.680]   See two two solid years of free hbo and a bunch of other discounts, but I don't know if it's worth it
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.680]   I mean is is hbo really?
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.640]   I mean nefflux nefflux is still a flex seven eight bucks a month or something
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.600]   Yeah, nine bucks. I think yeah, so I mean is that really worth it to get those hbo shows
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.000]   50 shows you want girls you want girls. Yeah, maybe that's it
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:40.240]   thing is the game of thrown in tax is what it does exactly what it is totally I
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:46.240]   Um, I am such a fan of wireless charging. I I actually helps me determine what phones to get
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.600]   I was really pleased to see the s6 is going to be doing both chi and power mat those are competing
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.520]   Um, I added chi charging to my note for which doesn't come with it
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.240]   But Samsung sells in a relatively expensive back
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.640]   And all it does is add a little circuitry you note that when most of the Samsung phones have
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:05.440]   Can you know have little connectors for that?
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:12.080]   So you just snap that on and a chi charge is not quite as well as the phones that has chi built in but I love chi charging now
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.160]   IKEA is going to release furniture with built-in chargers
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.000]   Yeah
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.400]   Best your night table has it you just put the phone down that's it but you know what I really want leo
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:28.080]   I want a desk with chi built in a chi chat chi desk. I want a chi desk chi desk
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.880]   Yeah, it seems kind of silly to have nightstands. Let's have let's have a desk
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.040]   Well, I mean at night you put it on nightstand or the day. Are those lamps are those lamps? Do they have chi charging bases?
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.040]   Yes, so yeah, you do that's nice
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.000]   Here's the question. Is there a chi charging laptop?
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.760]   No, it doesn't I don't think I'd be good
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:53.840]   Now that was tough to charge. It's using inductance and I have a feeling, you know, it's just not gonna there's a chi charging
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.640]   Uh cutting board
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:02.800]   Apparently what if you why would you want that? It looks like a wedding board. I mean, maybe you have a wireless knife
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.240]   I don't know. Yeah, it does look like a cutting doesn't it and they've got it surrounded by food
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:11.840]   So it's like oh, I'll just uh, you know chop up my meat and leave my phone on the cutting board to charge up
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.120]   All right. Well, wireless is I'm just I love it and uh all phones should have it
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:21.680]   This is so brilliant. Why they didn't think of it before just just to make a phone out of those little pads
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.040]   I mean you could have fed those into a desk pretty easily. I mean they should be selling a desk
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.960]   I don't know whether or not but well Richard Richard Jingeris shows off his um
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:35.760]   Woodworking projects all the time in bars and stuff, you know, I I could imagine he would make that
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:39.360]   Better I think I think wireless is coming to the Starbucks, right?
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.760]   But there has to be little little elements. Yeah, I mean imagine if you went to a bar and the whole bar was changed
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.560]   Put your phone down. Yep, it charges. Yep
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:53.600]   I'm sad to say that one of my uh heroes matt howie who created meta filter
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:34:00.000]   16 years ago and meta filter. We talked about this was going through an economic crisis of uh of kind
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.160]   Uh, it wasn't making as much money from google ads and so forth. He's decided to retire
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.920]   Um, he knows he said it's leaving it in good hands. Yeah
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.440]   Because the moderators are still there. It's a community
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:18.000]   Yeah, but uh, it is this you look at it. It really feels like the uh latter day web doesn't it? It's kind of the good old days
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.080]   Yeah, and matt is a sweet guy and I I wish him the best
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:25.840]   He is a great guy and he's gone through this this surress in the past
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.840]   He's you know, he asked this question years ago
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.960]   When I was around it and god bless him stuck it out and stayed with it and really built something amazing. Yep
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.080]   So matt every season turn turn turn if you want a broadcast career, we got a place for you
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.840]   Just come on over here. Yeah, and this article from kevin marks facebook twitter and google plus shun
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.680]   html and he blames that on the on the infographic plague
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:57.280]   I don't know kevin by choosing images over links and by restricting mark up facebook twitter and google plus
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.320]   Are hostile to html and it is true. In fact, there's a new service
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.800]   that uh
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.800]   a new iphone app that lets you
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:13.760]   Screen cap text and put it in twitter and this is how people are getting around the 140 character barrier
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:18.160]   Not only that. I think I think i think medium has a build-in so you can you can do that in medium now
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:23.840]   Yeah, that's sad. So it is kind of sad. Here's my plea for why i'm at 2012
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:30.400]   Oh, is that oh did I how do i let's buy fault i put it in here. How oh no, it says on march 4th
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.520]   Unless unless this is an old article
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.800]   Maybe maybe kevin just typed the wrong year
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:45.360]   Please provide equal space for html. That's not going to happen and for authors and designers everywhere stop making giant bit maps
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:51.120]   When well written text with charts that are worth the bit spent on charts and charts and charts and texts that are searchable
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.160]   I mean you don't know the text has quoted yeah in twitter now. You could say the same thing about podcasts
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.320]   No, this was originally published 2011. Oh, sorry
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:06.880]   Why so it just it was on mediums. I was it was new is my fault. Yeah, I think he well. I think he reposted
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.520]   Yeah, he did. Yeah, so it's great news. It showed up nothing. He's gotten better in three years

[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.760]   uh
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.760]   Do you want to rant on uh?
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.280]   No, I just want I think we're going to show the cover first one second if you click on just show the cover
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.880]   So darsh beagle in germany had what I thought was an absolutely ridiculous. Oh my god
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.600]   so it has uh
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.120]   Not the ceo of google but but sari a brand sir. Yeah brand marissa mire mark zucker berg
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.520]   Who's this guy to sarger's right?
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.440]   Travis
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.080]   Kalanek uber. Oh uber's Travis Kalanek and of course tim cook and it's develt
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:56.960]   Rigid wrong regarold government house silicon valley is controlling our future
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.120]   Oh, come on and it's just
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:05.200]   Obnoxious now. I I used the german n-word to describe this and I got accused of violating godwood's law
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.240]   But my real argument is that is that they were using
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.960]   That kind of when you're talking about ruling the world, you know, that's exactly
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:18.240]   Rhetoric is just over the top ridiculous and the thing is actually I kind of agree
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:23.040]   It's good. I think these guys are met they left out elon musk. They left out a few people
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.000]   Yeah, I mean, they're just pandering to the
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.800]   I mean the
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.600]   Large popular opinion over in europe right though. I mean, isn't this
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:38.560]   They're totally pandering to a fear. I think a common fear that one can welcome our new silicon valley over lorn
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.920]   I do too. I want smart people to run the world. I'm ready to move neither ambitious politicians
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.000]   It's going to be a hell of a lot better than congress
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.360]   Yeah
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:52.080]   I'm ready to move into the new google verse and shun the rest of society right the google plex
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.360]   I'll I'll live under the dome. Yeah, that's what it takes live under the dome
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.880]   Yeah zombies be damned embrace the dome people
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:03.760]   Um
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.080]   But it is the it is the staple it has been for decades of a lot of science fiction the idea
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.640]   In fact, I think uh, neuromancer corporate
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.760]   Corporations run the world not governments
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.560]   And I think that we're headed that way a little bit. Yeah
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.520]   When you see steve wasne act in a Cadillac commercial, you know times are chaining
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:32.480]   Die it said tell me again d veldraiga room veldra gear on developed regi room. I like it
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.280]   So you don't need to go any further ramp
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.080]   Just answered me today
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:44.000]   Eagle gets a big pass for me. They've been one of the journals publishing a lot of the snowed material
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.560]   I'm gonna give him a pass
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:52.720]   I would have to I would respect them. I think they're just over the top over the top too much too much
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.160]   Um
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.040]   Yes, let's move on. We're gonna get your tips picks
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.000]   Number of the week and uh, we're gonna do an inside twit right after lee says told me we want
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.560]   To tell the world what's going on at this little business of ours
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.680]   This little light of mine. I'm gonna let it shine our show brought to you by hit chat
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.920]   Actually, uh, I do have some updates on our our website. We've been using that's when I first encountered hip chat
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:24.000]   We've been using it with our web design team in austin down there at four kitchens
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.400]   And they're they're big at lassi and house. They use jira and all that stuff if you're a developer
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.160]   Hip chat makes a whole heck of a lot of sense at first you look at it and go well. It's just instant messenger. Oh, no
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.160]   It's a whole lot more. It's kind of instant messenger on steroids. It allows you to do
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:41.840]   uh document sharing video chat screen sharing
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.520]   Um, it works with 57 services
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.680]   So there's a sense of fun to it too much like hangouts. It has like, you know, mojis and fun things
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.920]   It's just a great way to stay in touch with a team, especially if that team is spread out
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:01.520]   Email too slow. It's asynchronous meetings. Oh god. Don't not another meeting
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.600]   Regular instant messaging doesn't have all the features that hip chat does
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:09.760]   And it even works with github and jira of course and zendesk
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:15.440]   We use it. I have hip chat running on all my systems all my mobile devices works everywhere you are
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.400]   There's even a great html5 based web version. So on a chrome book. No problem
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.960]   easy to use
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.360]   We've built a hip chat team for our engineering team our sales team

[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.320]   Hip chat your team your project in sync
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.960]   instantly
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.360]   Hip chat's cool
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.960]   Do you what do you use it net app?
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.680]   Use a combination of things we use a chatter because we're sales force, you know sales people use sales force
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.160]   We use instant messenger. We use a lot of Cisco tools
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:29.520]   But what's nice about hip chat is it kind of combines all that stuff it solves that
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:35.760]   It solves that the other thing is uh, it's uh encrypted. Yeah, and then encrypted. So it's a really good choice for
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:41.760]   Uh, a team that is you know, and like you said especially developers some of the things that they plug into the all the tools that they plug into
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.960]   Oh, it's so cool. I don't want to extend the commercial, but it is I've looked at it
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:49.360]   It is really exciting products. Well, you know, there's a lot of attention to a slackster but it feels slack right now
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:56.960]   But as somebody said, okay, are you gonna are you gonna use a tool designed by Atlassian by programmers for programmers for teams
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.160]   Are you guys a tool by a guy who did flicker and glitch? Right?
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.880]   Right actually slack is cool, but
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.240]   Hip chat is the tool we use and I'm really fond of it. Yep
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.480]   Uh, erin you got something you want to you you're doing I love all the projects and stuff you do and the things you do
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:17.360]   Yeah, uh, you last time you were here. You brought an old time radio device. It was really a rasprit
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:23.120]   You're interested in the windows 10 version of rasprit. Uh, I'm I'm I am interested in it
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.840]   I'm interested in it. Absolutely. In fact, I just did a review for byb
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:31.760]   Which will be coming up shortly on the rasprit pi model 2 and I forgot to mention it runs windows 10
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.440]   Yeah, um
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:39.680]   You know what I'm interested in fun to do is make a twit box. Yeah, you know like a steam box, but it's a twit box, right?
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.880]   Because it has hdmi out there. Yeah, absolutely low power. We could charge 40 bucks for it. Yeah
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.360]   And then just you plug it in and you get twit on it and you get twit absolutely all the time
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:54.240]   You could totally do that in a lot more. I mean a lot of people run xbmc or not sign expensive anymore
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.600]   It's what I think that's what we do. We put we put plex on it or whatever and uh, right?
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.840]   Right and then have uh
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.760]   Things have it all set up, but it's set up for twit for twit. Yeah. Yeah, you turn it on and boop. There you go choose your show
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.880]   Get absolutely doing so you're doing refrigerator magnets refrigerator magnets. I try to bring something
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:17.520]   Um because you know, I'm a maker at heart and I'm always making something I figure what we need to mix it up a little bit on twig
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.440]   So, um, I like to bring a project. So my project today is refrigerator magnets
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:28.400]   So don't throw out those old keyboards. Oh a lot of things we talk about at the maker space is reuse those old electronics
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.000]   And this is a great way to reuse keyboards. They already have the letters printed on them
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.440]   So why not just attach some magnets to the back? Oh and they can use them as refrigerator magnets. That's cool
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:39.280]   Yeah, it's kind of cool and techie
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.160]   Uh really easy to do you can just pry those things right off
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.720]   You don't have to worry about breaking them because you're going to reuse them anyway
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.160]   Uh, basically you just saw off after you take the keys out
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.880]   They'll be a little post well here you go. Here's right in the video say that little post is from instructables
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.520]   This is from instructables. Um, you just kind of take that little post off where it plugs into the keyboard
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]   Amazing how easy it is to break on. I know
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.600]   Well, I've got that to clean keyboards actually you just glue on little those little magnets and you can even recycle these
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.400]   I don't know about you, but I get these from real estate agents and stuff
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.360]   They send you a calendar that comes up the calendar put it up those magnets reuse the magnets
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:18.400]   And then put these on your refrigerator and uh, you know if you got a couple of keyboards
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.760]   Then you can really start, you know spelling some cool words or doing some cool
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.680]   That's kind of like the uh the poetry magnets, you know, but yeah a little geeky here
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.080]   A little fun. Yeah
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.480]   Instructables.com if you uh want to know
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.000]   Uh more. Yeah, or just google just google a keyboard refrigerator magnets. There's several
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.840]   Uh several good instructables and links to projects out there that you could follow
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.400]   God bless the hot glue gun. That's right. Do you have a favored hot glue gun?
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.080]   No, just about anything you can even get them at the dollar store
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:53.520]   Right. I mean they work fine. So just about any hot glue gun mine has hot and cold
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:58.400]   You know hot and not so hot temperature control, which is nice. Yeah, it's kind of
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.280]   It's just not any glue gun to work. A tepid glue gun. Yep
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:02.560]   A tepid glue gun. That's right
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:10.320]   Jeff your number or the week? Uh, well, how do you follow Martha Stewart, you know, I know it's tough
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.880]   Uh our our Martha
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:15.760]   So, um
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:21.280]   Recode, uh, Lauren good. I presume it's good not good. E with an E at the end, but I'll presume good
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:27.600]   I think you're right. It's good. I think yeah, I think it is. Okay. Good said, uh, that google says that the error rate
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:31.760]   On google voice commands is down to 8% 92% of the time
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.040]   Wow
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.160]   So she had a fun story where she just watching house of cards
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:40.240]   She just tried to use it and the the fun is to give me a good set list
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.840]   You mean you hold it up to frank question
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.360]   And it does searches
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.600]   Yeah, no, no, it didn't do that. That's too cool
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.800]   But all the questions she had she just asked google. Yeah
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:56.080]   And and you know, I I forget to use voice command and it really does become changing when you do use it when I do dictator or
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.720]   Ask a question really does make life a lot easier
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.720]   And I like this story because it was it was a whole bunch of questions about
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.240]   Um, how's the cards plus other things in life and what worked and what didn't and it does work pretty darn well
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.480]   Nate
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:14.960]   8% that's the name 8% is higher than you think I mean that so
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:21.280]   For years we used programs like dragon naturally speaking to dictate and it was it was like 90% accurate
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.960]   That sounds really good
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.920]   Until you realize that means one in every 10 words you have to retype
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.160]   Yeah, suddenly that's not so good
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.480]   So the problem here I think is that it just it utterly flummoxes on some things right
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.640]   You know some restaurant names and stuff the thing that drives me nuts when I exalt
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.760]   I'm driving home and I want to order out for food on the way home
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.640]   And so I use voice command. I'm not gonna type anything and I'll ask for a rest that there's two
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.840]   Um, there's a place around here called urban table. There's two of them. There's one near me
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:55.040]   I ask for it by town and google never gives it to me. I know that's frustrating, isn't it?
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.560]   I can't figure out. I'm giving you the data google. Why can't you figure this out?
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:03.040]   Yeah, I don't know. I don't understand. They're not perfect. It turns out. Yeah, that's that's the revelation of the day
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.440]   Isn't that weird? We all kind of
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.520]   Have our our own ways of looking things up that to make sure we get the right thing
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.840]   I mean, I'm sure that we all do that right? I do
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.120]   Yeah, I'll type in you know
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:15.360]   I know that if I type in one thing, it's not going to give me the right thing
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.560]   So I type in
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:21.200]   You know the name of the restaurant game google you game google. Yeah, you totally game google after a while
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:27.440]   Um, I just yell louder. That doesn't seem to help at all. I know I I have said some very nasty words
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:35.040]   Very ridiculous as we're driving like we have road rage. We're just upset with google can't hear what we're saying in our cars
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.120]   I'll bet there's somebody at google who has a running f counter people screaming in
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:41.760]   Google apparently
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:49.280]   Did you see that article that uh who whose text to speech was being saved a series series? Yeah, and a guy
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:54.960]   I can't remember if it was read it or somewhere said hey by the way you should know I work for a company where we're going through
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:57.200]   um
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:02.560]   These audio transcriptions is quite a few of them and I don't know they're mining data of some kind out of them nothing
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.160]   ominous
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.480]   But he realized they were actually serie. Yeah
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.520]   And that uh all of that stuff is being saved
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:13.440]   And he says it's quite entertaining to hear the kinds of things people say
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:16.640]   To serie and apparently there's a database somewhere
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.920]   Uh-oh
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:23.280]   Just you should be aware of that. I think that big uh, sure over the sam-sung tv's
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:28.960]   Always baffled me because I thought well, don't you know that that everybody has to do that
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.920]   If there's no way that these devices can do voice recognition
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:37.120]   Effectively without being online. Yep. The server is always getting your voice after you trigger it
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.480]   Have have you talked on this show about the fact that all of all the voice searches you've ever done while logged into google
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:48.560]   Are actually catalogued for you and you hear all those audio files. Yeah, and what I found really interesting about this
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.840]   It doesn't really creep me out that this happens because I just kind of assume that's just part of how the service works
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.680]   And it's gonna happen or whatever
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.160]   What's weird is as i've gotten so used to wearing an android wear watch all the time
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.360]   All the random misfires that happen throughout the day you're talking and suddenly i get a lot of those
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.960]   Yeah, so when you look at the list you see all of these transcriptions
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:12.560]   Some of them are actual searches like okay, google search for blah blah blah
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.960]   But others are like parts of your daily life
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:18.960]   Just like a conversation that you're having or something that you're listening to
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:25.120]   Is really interesting to see it in that perspective and be like wow a lot of the things that I intend to be
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.760]   You know, it's past to google r and then there's a lot of stuff that I do not intend for google
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.120]   I think there's a writer for the good wife watching you're gonna see an episode based around that
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.440]   Why do the words murder
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:39.920]   Some up in your google transcript
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:46.000]   I'm almost tempted to play some of these this is in your dashboard right google.com slash dashboard under audio
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000]   I think it's under audio because I see yeah you're under audio
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.840]   Uh, there you go. I don't know if I dare play any of these
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.600]   You'll see some of them and I wonder if some of them are you know, look and tell you what it is
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.680]   How about this you want to listen?
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.200]   Okay google
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:08.000]   How many tablespoons of sugar are there in 16 ounces of soda?
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.120]   That was uh, that was at a pizza parlor. I was man. You have to have a misfire in there though
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.240]   About drinking soda, uh, yeah, we were talking talking here. How about this one?
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:21.120]   On my way home now period
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:24.320]   Do you want me to come right home or is it okay if I stop at the
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:32.000]   So that one's intentional. Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm recording no all of these are some of them are not I have tons that are not intentional
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.680]   Let me play the yeah, I don't know if I want to play this is it nine this morning
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:38.480]   I yeah, you know what?
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.480]   I know right
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:44.880]   And by the way, only you can see these yes and you can delete them
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:50.640]   Um, but yeah, isn't that wild. I don't know if people know that you crazy. No, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:53.280]   um
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:56.800]   Okay enough of that
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.920]   We could all get a I should have previewed these ahead of time
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:06.720]   Because I don't know what happened in nine this morning, but uh, but was it was my watch? Did you do it? Oh?
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:13.200]   That's why I'm not sure. I want to quick. I can have it in preview and then I know oh, you just want to hear it
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:18.640]   You saw my butt yesterday. How much more do you want? Okay, that's true. I just
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.520]   Anyways, no comment. We didn't air it, but I was going through it. We were showing how
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:29.280]   Uh that the deletion in the new I cloud photos the beta that apple's throwing off
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:34.560]   When you delete it on one thing deletes it everywhere and I had very carefully gone through my photos
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.280]   At home before because I know I show these on the air
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:40.480]   So and I knew we were going to talk about it. So I went through and deleted anything
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:45.200]   Remotely, you know scandalous, but for some reason there's like three pictures of mine
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:50.480]   Yep, not deleted and unfortunately Jason saw them all
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:55.600]   The way you would say this is there's three pictures of your tattoo. Right. Maybe that's what that was about. I don't know
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:58.720]   Yeah, oh yeah, there were there were pictures of your
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.280]   Darière
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.020]   My jen
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.520]   Dari
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.760]   A butt selfie
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:06.960]   Belfie a belphy
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.920]   Belfie
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.440]   So I just kind of give you an update
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:14.000]   Have you played with Appinvener at all or have your kids? I love Appinvener and I'm loving it more
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.360]   Well, I just did because I you know so in the radio show I have to hit
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:23.600]   It's a network show so I have to hit out times very hard
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:29.200]   By the second out times and I'm kind of perennially late and I had written a script for my for apple script
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:34.640]   But it wasn't working anymore. So I thought oh, this might be a good use for my Nexus 7 tablet
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:39.600]   I keep it on the charger. So I went to Appinvener. I mentioned this before it is so easy
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:45.520]   You drag and drop in pieces of the user interface in the designer and then you go in the blocks
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:52.560]   I have to admit as somebody who's written software. It's your fight. I found myself fighting Appinvener because you know, there's no case statement
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.880]   So I'm building this like giant if then else
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:53:00.560]   Tree and stuff like that, but ultimately I did get an app that is really it works and it's great
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.200]   And it was very simple and what's happens after you build it?
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:07.840]   um, you just uh, let's see go here and say build you can either
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.240]   They'll store it for I think a day or two
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:16.480]   You can have a QR code that you can just take a picture of and download it or you could save it to your computer and email it
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:18.560]   So I just saved it actually I saved it to google drive
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.760]   And all my devices have google drive so I can go to google drive and download the app and I have it now
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.520]   And so when it's yellow it means I have less than two minutes before the break
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:32.880]   It goes to red with the last minute if I'm in a if i'm talking on the show
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:36.560]   Uh, you know, it's green if i'm in a commercial. It's blue
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:41.520]   It's just a countdown timer. It's just a big but this was easy to write took me a couple of hours
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.760]   Yep, put it on my phone. I could put it everywhere
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:47.040]   If there's limits to what you can do with app and vener
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:53.040]   Um, it's really designed. I think more to teach kids how to program it is. Mm-hmm. It uses kind of the scratch methodology
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:57.760]   Yeah, it's like scratch. Yep, uh, if you play with things like tinker tyn k er
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:00.880]   It's a very similar thing can naturally graduate to this
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.640]   Um, but I think they've done a great job. See not only have 30 seconds left. I'm running out of running at a time on the
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.000]   On the countdown clock. That's awesome. It works great good for you
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.720]   That's just something something very simple. You're not going to write the next great app on here believe me
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:17.920]   But if but for a little utility and what I think is important
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:23.440]   Is that you kind of teach kids you want it to yourself not to just be consumers, but to be creators
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:28.640]   Right even something as simple as this gives you a sense of mastery over your technology
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.840]   And you're not quite as helpless. Yep, and now I've run out of time
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:34.880]   And we're in a commercial break for 342 seconds
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:39.120]   No, I didn't do the thing where you make it minutes and seconds. I figured this is good enough
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:42.080]   That's good enough. And by the way doing that there's no printf
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.920]   There's no right things doing that is actually a little bit
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:48.880]   Compful you just program in the times for the whole rundown. Yeah
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:52.880]   Oh, if I wanted to get fancy, I would put little buttons here that would let you
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:55.120]   Yep, you know make it other people do it
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.440]   But just the idea is is that you could do something so simple is really really great
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:02.160]   It's app inventor and all you have to do is search for app inventor
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.160]   MIT hosted Google developed it originally
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.200]   MIT hosts it now and it's free to use and what's cool is your programming on the web you could do it in google chrome
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:11.280]   It doesn't there's no
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:17.200]   The whole thing's on the web all your code and everything right? You don't need anything. It's really quick and easy to get started. Yeah. Yep
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:19.200]   Yeah, I love it
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:21.440]   Canada zero and the bomb didn't go off
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.560]   But this show has
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.240]   Thank you very much for coming up and then joining us here and yeah, you really appreciate it
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:33.600]   You bet always leisure you're on the google plus you're on the twitter anything else you want to plug that you're doing
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.760]   Uh, well floss weekly. I was on floss weekly this morning. That's what we brought you to
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:45.120]   Yeah, I kind of coordinated that with between randal and uh, Jason, you know try to get that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:49.600]   No, it's absolutely it was a really fun morning with randal if you haven't checked it out
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.920]   You should go check out the topic. Um, it was a company called. I'm just pulling it up now
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:58.320]   I want to make every loss weekly is these days has been a open source project of some kind of yeah
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:01.600]   Yeah, absolutely for the last few years. I love that and this one is a little bit of a surprising
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:06.720]   It's called crisis cleanup. I don't know if you've heard about it. It's an open source application for managing
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:12.560]   Um after there's a crisis for managing volunteers. Wow getting them involved with uh, you know
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:17.760]   Mobilizing essentially so you've got the baptist church and the methodist church and the lutheran church
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:21.040]   They all want to you know help out with some sort of disaster
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.560]   Confident in each other's way. They don't want to get in each other's way. Maybe some of them have facilities to do, you know overnight
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.040]   Uh housing some of them have food capabilities so they can basically take this
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:36.160]   Uh, program and run it and kind of coordinate a little bit better and it's all based on open source
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.400]   I love really fantastic examples of how open source is being used in business and
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:46.560]   Ngo's and charity. I mean it's more than just geeks doing databases. Yeah, no SQL databases
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:49.920]   There's a lot of great stuff. Yeah, so check that out one more thing. Well. I've got the camera
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.920]   Uh, if you are in the bay area and you'd like to come to a maker fair
