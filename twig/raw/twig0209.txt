[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.320]   Are you in your office? Oh, I know why the angles different you're on a Mac
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.600]   I'm so sorry. I can get us back to the non, but I switched
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.200]   I actually time traveled I went back four months free pixel
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.960]   Yes, I had a scare when I booed oh and Gina Trapani is here also from smarter where dot org hi Gina and all about Android
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.600]   Hello, hello, hello, you know, we had Dan Benjamin on the show on Sunday
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.080]   But that made me so happy
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.000]   I loved and it made me feel like oh like the two podcasting godfathers together at the same table. It was amazing
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.280]   Yeah, it was a very generous act to put them there and then and the greatest moment was when they did the commercial where they both have a code
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.000]   Leo what first offer that you could use either code. Yeah. Oh
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.120]   I changed my mind because what he did something that made me mad. I forgot what he wanted the mug or something
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.880]   He said can I have the mug? Yeah, I said you can have the mug, but you can't then I want my code back
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.520]   Hey, did he take the mug I don't remember he didn't well then you can use his code I
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.940]   Know I'm way too generous. I don't know why I'm so
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.440]   It was really cool for someone who's a fan and obviously I'm a host on both networks
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.840]   But to be a fan of both networks to see that you two together was very very cool
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.320]   And I don't really get to see Dan because you know he doesn't do video
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.640]   so
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.840]   So that was really cool. It's like oh it's a good looking fella, but you know he's smaller than I thought because you
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.240]   When you see him in person. He's he's kind of a I always get the opposite. I always get oh you're tall
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.920]   Yeah, you're tall. Yeah, no way. No way knows it for my little honey face here
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.480]   I guess people just assume that you're kind of a certain average and then when they meet in person then you if you deviate
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.840]   What's really bad is and I've had this for years since I've been in radio since
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.200]   1976
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.960]   When people don't ever see you, but they hear your voice and they meet you there they can't help it their face always falls
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.920]   I thought you were tall and blonde oh
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.300]   No, I'm so dark is six - yeah
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.320]   She is so tall you really it's so amazing to meet her in person actually that didn't
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.420]   World career is something she never talks about the NBA super star
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.480]   Gold medal from the Olympics in 2002 really amazing
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.160]   Yeah, later ladies could squash me with one
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.680]   sneaker one sneaker they could say could smash me you know it's tall and I
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.360]   Hate doing this. I think I said I suppressed my reaction when I met you for the first time Jeff
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.960]   But you know who's really tall and I couldn't suppress my reaction
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.600]   Do you know whose odd ideas is she's a podcaster?
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.140]   And she is very tall so much so that I could not suppress my reaction. I was like
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.200]   She was tall on because because of the podcast that I watched she would get off and move around in her chair
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.120]   Yeah, yeah, it's a sense of her yeah
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.560]   Yeah, yeah
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.320]   Just shocked you know and I've been watching her for years
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.600]   And I was just like whoa and it was epic food probably is when you were watching this great podcast. Yeah, but
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.040]   Yeah, she's extremely tall
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.760]   And I feel bad because you know when I go oh you're tall the poor woman's probably getting that her whole life
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.560]   Right, so I feel bad, but what can you do sure people's you know they meet me they go? Oh my god
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.720]   You're gorgeous and you know it's kind of embarrassing
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.360]   But I have to live up with that live to that statistically tall people are more successful
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.840]   So you don't you're right you're right. I was almost like saying
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.920]   You're better than me Wow Wow
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:15.520]   My sister for a long time dated a her college boyfriend was it was a short guy was very sensitive about it and for a while
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.040]   Thank God. They didn't happen for a while. They were engaged and I had my reaction was oh good
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.000]   I've always wanted a little brother. Oh dear. Yeah
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.440]   Those are embarrassing things you can never take back no
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   Nothing you can do
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.240]   Hey, you know what I don't want to miss the change log last week the entire episode with a change log because of course
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.320]   We followed in the heels of Google's amazing morning announcement with the new Kindle 4.3
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.760]   And of course the Chromecast so let's just launch right into it Brian Burnett. Do you have the trumpets?
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.260]   Would you play the change log trumpets right now?
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.760]   The Google change log
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, what's new at Google Gina Tarpani has everything
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.360]   Google has relaunched zagets or sorry zagat I guess it's a gat zagat zagat zagat zagat
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.300]   Zagat's website and mobile apps. There's no payment or registration required
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.440]   Yeah, so this is the first time all of the Gats ratings reviews are available free. You don't even have to register
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.440]   Right now the website only covers nine cities San Francisco Austin Boston, Chicago, London
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.920]   Los Angeles New York City Philadelphia and DC, but that's going to expand Google says
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   And it's a little deceptive because for instance you can search for restaurants with zagat ratings in Petaluma and it will show them
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.080]   So you choose a location and the website lets you shoot
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.320]   But you can still apparently still has access to the full database. I'm not sure it's unclear, but Petaluma's restaurants are still in there
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.000]   Interesting. Yeah, I just installed that the Android app and it made me choose a
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.520]   City from that small selection. Yeah, yeah from that small selection, but now it's interesting. That's your default
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.320]   That's your default, but you can still search by location as you could before you could say what's near me right now
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   So that is fabulous. I love zagat. Yeah, yeah, this is this is really nice
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.720]   It's cool to see them putting resources into into this relaungent and it's gonna expand to beyond just
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.120]   Just restaurants as well, which is where's the gat was headed. It's also pretty. I mean, it's more editorial looking right?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.120]   Lots of big images and media really nice. I actually haven't looked out on a tablet yet
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.240]   But it looks it looks like it will be tablet optimized there goes a paywall
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.880]   Yeah, yeah, cuz what was this was I paid like 40 bucks a year or something. It wasn't cheap
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.280]   Yeah, and then they had the books that you'd have to buy the books -
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.040]   How integrated is it with Google?
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:50.720]   Well, it's always been in the maps, right if you are in a map and you tap a restaurant you can it's hard to find
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:57.640]   But you could get the zagat ratings if you worked around because Lisa and I have a game where we go to a restaurant
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   And she will say what the rating should be
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   And she's very good. I will always over rate a restaurant. She's very conservative and she's a very good at it
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.120]   Awesome. Yeah, it's fun. Yeah, that is fun
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.400]   And they're generally trustworthy. I find it, you know if you go to the best restaurant in an area on zagat
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   You're generally are going to the best restaurant in an area
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.920]   Calvin Trillan used to have a great Calvin Trillan the great New Yorker writer used to have a great routine about about how
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   When you went out of New York people thought they were taking you to the best restaurant and all it served was stuffed heavy with heavy
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.400]   Yeah, he's right - you know
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.680]   I was talking about we think we had a visitor from Greenville, South Carolina
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.960]   And I remember this was a while ago
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.640]   He says we've gotten better now, but I remember going to the best restaurant in Greenville and everything was fried and had hush puppies for every course
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   That's that's that's what it is
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.280]   Not that there's anything wrong with it user ratings all right, so that's one zagat
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:06.040]   Yeah, yeah on the heels of this this relaunch of the zagat Google plus the local iOS app will be retired on August
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.320]   7th you can kind of kind of make sense why there's a lot of overlap between the two properties
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.720]   And another retirement going on Google shopper will be retired on August 30th. What will Microsoft do its scruggle ads about?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.040]   Yeah
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.760]   Oh, man, there you go there you go
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.000]   What else do we have oh we got I know Leo you always sort of make fun of this feature
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.760]   But handwriting got added to the Google Translate a home page
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.080]   So if you go to translate dot Google dot course you could choose you could choose the you know
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   Which
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.480]   You want to translate from and to so if you choose a language then there's you'll see this little drop down
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   There's a keyboard drop down on the bottom left there. It's a select input tool. You can choose hand right
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.360]   Oh see I'm not on a Chrome. I got to do this on Chrome. I think yeah
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.520]   I think you have to do it on yeah, it says try a browser with automatic translation
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.280]   download Google Chrome
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.200]   Okay, oh try if you did you just wait did you select a
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.080]   language there
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh I see that's detect now. I could do it, right? Yeah, and then there's a there's a
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.280]   Here it is. Okay. There you go. So there's a right. Wow. All right. Yeah, exactly
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.640]   If you see a sign or you wanted to
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.920]   You can actually hand right with your mom's there have it translated
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.800]   Let's see if I can hand write something something like Chinese characters
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.080]   It would be very helpful for non-Roman characters. Yeah
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.600]   I'm going to Greece. This will be great. This is painful with a mouse
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.520]   And then oh yeah, no, I picked it up look at that
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.240]   It nice look at that
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.080]   Works it works back to back to the gat for a second if I may yes
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.320]   So I was looking at my New York app and and going back to a topic from two weeks ago
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.600]   If you look at my Google+ feed you'll see the first thing in there is that the cronut king has a new invention
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.160]   He had to because he's been cloned in the Philippines. Oh, no
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.880]   There's there's Manila cronuts now and cronuts all over the world apparently or whether there is good. No one knows
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   Can you get a cronut?
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:23.760]   innovative frozen s'more that manages to contain chili ice cream and a smoky charm
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:30.520]   There's a video of making this thing. It's all no no no. Oh, yeah, there's Jeff Jarvis. Let me see the best
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.680]   Wait a minute. No, it's doing something weird
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.240]   Should have a big Z there we go here. We go. Okay, right?
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:45.840]   Defrozen s'more. Oh, oh, oh the lines are gonna get even longer. I knew you like this. Oh
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:53.240]   That's a zagat by the way. That's interesting. Oh, that's on zagat as a gat spotlight
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.680]   We're saying that we're saying that oh, it's in spring street
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:03.640]   Going so far off topic. Oh look at that. Can you get an audio on that?
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   Brian I
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.000]   Don't hear it. There's a corona. You get to see a corona now
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.440]   Crona what?
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.280]   Crona sorry twig fans
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.640]   Must have
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   Cubes of amazing mess
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.520]   Of course is French
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   All of you pushes the ice cream into the malchamelo
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.720]   Or frozen s'more. It's hard to tell you know, they're both my babies. Oh, I think I'm gonna feel the favorite

[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.720]   Would you come to my house Dominique?
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:51.320]   100% and we've been meshing with that
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.800]   So he's you know, it's interesting. He's pretty open about how he does it
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.640]   Yeah, that's good
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   You can't you can't you can't
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   They even the cronuts
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.280]   It's funny to hear the word reverse words reverse engineering applied to pastries
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.560]   But that's what they talked about this woman in Manila
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.520]   suit about that she sent somebody to
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.080]   The bakery in New York and had him fly cronuts back to Manila
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.280]   So she could reverse engineer the cronut
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.200]   He makes his own marshmallow. That's not as hard as it looks
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.360]   Actually fun to make marshmallows if you're wanting to do that. Look at that. Yeah, and he made marshmallows are good. It's so good
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.200]   I get their square
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:47.320]   Branches that we get and we get them and then we smoke them with upper he's smoking them with apple wood
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.520]   So that's freaky. This is a little too good
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.160]   So those are smoked the skewers are smoked
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   I
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.280]   Had two bucks
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   This is kind of amazing I
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.860]   Loves a gap. This is good Google. Good job
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:15.440]   So there really is more editorial on this. Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, when we say Google doesn't own content
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.520]   They're big in the content
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.880]   And it well, we'll talk about this when we when we okay, we can stop this now
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.080]   Well, it's making me hungry. We can talk about this when we come back
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.440]   But they're obviously getting into hardware too in a big way, but go ahead. Let's continue with the change. Sorry for that little
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.040]   That's okay. That's okay. So we talked about last week how Android 4.3 the photo sphere feature got a lot better
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:45.560]   Google just rolled out a new site called views. It's a it's a maps site if you go to Google.com/maps/views
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.440]   It's it's a kind of a featured collection of user submitted photo spheres
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:58.120]   So you can go and you can see some really cool photo spheres of places like the Grand Canyon and beautiful islands
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:05.200]   Queenstown Tunisia all around the world. So kind of kind of fun to see what kind of stuff people are submitting
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:13.520]   You find them via the maps now too, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is just kind of a special
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.600]   sort of this is a gallery. Yeah, it's a gallery kind of
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.400]   Apparently picks the ugliest place in the world. Let me see if I
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:27.480]   Please go back. I don't want to be in Karen's. All right. There's the Grand Canyon though
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.160]   So is this built into this photosphere app? You'll have to tell us because I don't have a Google experience fun
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.440]   Is this yeah, you can submit to maps you can submit a photosphere to maps pretty easily
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.080]   I'll tell you the honest truth. I haven't done it
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:47.680]   But it definitely it always kind of felt like photos fears was was Google's way of equipping everybody with that that 360 camera
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.280]   Just in there credit to Microsoft because they for a long time had this capability and did have the way to submit it and
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.760]   Added to Bing Maps and stuff. It was more than just this photosphere. It was really quite an amazing
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:05.560]   Way to put pictures together. I can't remember the name of it, but these are these are gorgeous
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:11.640]   Stitch the photos together. Yeah that brilliant guy did that demo. Yeah, it was really an impressive technology
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.520]   Photos that's it. Yeah, this is kind of a poor man's photosense
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.160]   Thank you my pee or winster
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.480]   Yeah, so this is a poor man's photosense exactly exactly and
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.240]   Let's see what else we got. Oh last thing Google
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.600]   released an official Google AdSense Android app
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.680]   So you can go to play store you can find the AdSense app if you're running AdSense and version one
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:43.640]   Which is this initial version it provides earnings information custom URL channels add units and site reports and payment alerts
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.800]   So you get your AdSense updates right there right there on your phone. You can search for that in Google Play
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.960]   I haven't done much of that since in a while
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.840]   So I haven't actually had a chance to test it out
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:17:00.520]   But you're running a site with AdSense or running AdSense ads check that out and that's all I got and that play the drums is
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.120]   our
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   You kind of fell over
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.320]   Change log
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.600]   Thank you very very much. We're gonna take a break when we come back. Let's talk about
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.360]   There's so much to talk about
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.520]   the Chromecast now that was been out for a while people have had it kindle seven and my my
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.760]   NSA stuff as you talk and more NSA stuff as there always always more NSA stuff seems like
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.780]   And I want to talk to you about this idea that Google is now becoming a hardware company because I have to say
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.880]   They have some pretty damn good hardware and
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:50.520]   And tomorrow we're gonna add one more piece to that puzzle, but we'll talk about that too first a word from our sponsor Squarespace
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.000]   Dot-com I'm not giving Dan Benjamin's code this time
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.640]   Dan and I both love Squarespace Dan's a web developer
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:09.880]   So it's kind of neat that he actually into you know embraces Squarespace because this really puts web developers in some ways out of business
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.760]   You can be your own web developer even if you don't know CSS or JavaScript or H
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:22.340]   Even HTML because with Squarespace you have point and click access to the most amazing templates each of them can be totally customized
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.940]   So I'm just gonna pick one at random here. This is called Avenue one of the
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:32.620]   beautiful new Squarespace templates and then you can scroll down and look at a variety of
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.380]   websites using this not just
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.940]   You know you can you can say
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:44.820]   How are portfolios using Avenue how are stores using Avenue for e-commerce?
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.880]   Here's a website
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:51.140]   Crane and Johnson that they use Avenue to sell women's clothing online
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:56.140]   It's just and everyone looks unique everyone looks great stylish modern
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:02.900]   And you could try it yourself for free all you have to do is visit Squarespace calm click the try it free button
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.100]   Pick a template and by the way the beauty of this is as with all good
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:13.560]   Content hosting services and squarespaces both web hosting and content management
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.580]   The content is completely separate from the presentation
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.500]   So if tomorrow you want to use a different template no problem just press a button and suddenly you look completely different
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.140]   But your content remains there the SEO remains the same
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:30.220]   They've even got importers which makes it very simple to move from an existing site and notice they've got it
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.140]   I love it. They've got a Nexus 7 here
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.580]   They're showing that your site looks great not only on a 27 inch screen, but on an iPhone
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:45.220]   On an Android phone on a tablet every square space template is mobile enhanced so that it looks great at all sizes completely
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:50.420]   Responsive design now if you are a developer there's plenty for you, too. They've got a complete development
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:56.940]   Platform that includes a color coated syntax color coding in the editor

[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.820]   Google Yahoo Bing and all the other search engines
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:22.540]   It's the hosting the best hosting in the world plus the content management system that makes Squarespace unique
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.140]   Do it for two weeks free. You don't need to give them a credit card
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.860]   You don't need to give them anything, but your email address so they can send you the password when you forget it
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:37.940]   That's it and after two weeks if you decide to buy I think you're gonna be blown away by the price as little as $8 a month with the
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.300]   Basic annual plan. I would recommend the unlimited plan that's $16 a month when you pay annually and it gives you something
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.660]   I know of no other host that does this unlimited bandwidth. You'll never get a bandwidth bill
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:58.140]   Even if you become the most popular site on the internet, it's gonna cost you $16 a month unlimited storage pages galleries blogs contributors
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.100]   You even when you buy the annual plan get a custom domain name free and they'll hook it all up for you
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.300]   Of course the best customer support in the world and workshops to free workshops seminars
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.380]   So that you can learn the ins and outs you can really perfect what you're doing if you decide you want to do e-commerce

[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:03.540]   Dot com I wish there were square space button for life. I could just hit it and look entirely different combined
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.540]   Ah, would that be good? Yeah, the contents the same
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.420]   Presentation is a different separate the content layer from
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.940]   Presentation layer we ought to do that really how to do that in humans
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.060]   humans
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:25.220]   So let's talk about hardware because yes last week of course with Sundar
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.100]   Pachai we saw a new Nexus tablet that is
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.980]   arguably the best small tablet made as
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:38.460]   You said on Twitter this week. Well, I think there you have no reason to buy an iPad mini
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.660]   You know though I can give you one reason it's for three the aspect ratio
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.820]   But the and the only other reason is if you're trapped in the ecosystem if you are trapped in iTunes
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:55.940]   And you you know, you've spent so much money on iTunes content or but even you know even the music now is unprotected in iTunes
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.940]   So it would have to be TV or movies
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:03.660]   I guess but it's not like you're gonna throw away that capability. You just can't do it on the tablet
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:11.820]   It is the screen is gorgeous. It's very fast about playing games on it. The OpenGL support is superb
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:19.020]   It's just great hardware and then they do the Chrome cast which admittedly right now isn't
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:24.140]   You know, it's isn't much. It's not much to pay for either. It's 35 bucks, but
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.500]   I think if it looks like it sold out
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.620]   Do we do we have any thoughts about what that means? How many of the units they might have sold?
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.940]   There are a couple of data points one Netflix the Netflix deal is over
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.460]   Right like the first day
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.860]   And that you and there's at least what three or four weeks now to get one
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.620]   I think best buys were getting a couple dozen of them. They sold out quickly
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:52.700]   50,000 a hundred thousand a million how many did they sell I?
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.660]   Think they were obviously surprised because they had to pull back the Netflix deal
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.820]   I think that took off even more than they knew yeah, how are they surprised though?
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.620]   I mean these things are so cheap. They must they they should have made I mean gazillions of them
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.860]   I don't know it surprised me they sold out so quickly or that or they thought they sold out
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.980]   But that there's a delay so quickly there's a magic price point if you are at a certain price point
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.340]   We know that it's 99 bucks for tablets, right?
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:26.020]   Because even Microsoft's surface RT sells out of 99 bucks and the playbook the blackberry playbook 99 bucks
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:31.740]   It's sold out so there's a magic price point. I think thirty five dollars is so low that it's an impulse purchase
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:39.420]   I got one before I got the two others if it just reversed the order and and so I put it in that night and
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:44.860]   The next day I was driving myself nuts because I was sitting in my office and I wanted to just cast stuff to the TV there
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:50.660]   And I couldn't do it. Oh interesting. It's it's really addictive though. However, that's the good news
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:56.860]   The bad news is when I got together to I went to the bedroom put it in there the Wi-Fi is not superb there doesn't work
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:02.420]   So well, yeah, you need to have good Wi-Fi I think but and I you know some other bugs if I accidentally closed the window
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.820]   On the laptop. There's no way to control. It's on the TV
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.420]   Really even if you open the window, you can't get back get the control. I didn't think so I tried maybe that maybe I just got it wrong
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.660]   I don't know, you know, I just go to YouTube. I don't know what would know I'm gonna open
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:20.980]   So you know, it's not perfect, but it really changes how I think of TV and and it changes
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.260]   Very importantly for Google the notion of discovering TV. I
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.900]   Frankly didn't use YouTube all that much now
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:33.740]   I'm driving the things to find more stuff because it's just so easy and wonderful to put it across watching twit on
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.620]   This way is great
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.900]   Think about the YouTube thing you said is very interesting because isn't this one of I mean Google's put
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:49.700]   500 million dollars or something into the idea of making YouTube be more like a real TV network not the crotch shot channel
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:55.020]   But like real content and this is a big piece of the puzzle and it's on your big screen easily
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.180]   Yes, yes
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:04.620]   It makes all the difference and even the stuff you got to put up, you know without having the there's not Chromecast capable yet works fine
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:10.660]   I think the other very innovative thing is that you're not controlling it with a remote. Oh, you're not controlling
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.900]   You're just it's you look it up on your phone and you send it and
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.900]   It's just a natural way to do it
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.460]   if you of course you have to have a smartphone and iOS or Android smartphone
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.860]   But I have to think so the reason I asked the number is
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.220]   Let's say they sold a quarter of a million. I think that's not unreasonable
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.660]   That is enough. I think for companies to sit up and say oh
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:39.500]   There would be in our interest to add a Chromecast button. Well, and now the rumor at least is that HBO go they said it
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   They admitted it said that loud. Yeah, good. Yeah, they said they're gonna do it. They're gonna support it. Yep. That's great
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:51.620]   Plex is gonna do it now that's interesting because that means all your media will be playable through the Chromecast
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.980]   If you use Plex
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:02.540]   So in the Plex player. Yeah, okay, so in the Plex media player on your desktop
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:07.380]   You can then send you'd have to have a Plex you have to have a Plex you have to Plex media server somewhere
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.900]   But you can then control it through Chromecast
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:15.260]   So you'll have a Plex app. This is how I would imagine you'd have the Plex app on your device
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.660]   You'd have a Plex server somewhere a desktop computer or a network attached storage and
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:25.300]   You would then fire up Plex on your iPhone or your Android phone
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.100]   Press the Chromecast button choose your content from your media server put it on your screen and
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.060]   Google is gonna approve that there still is an approval process, right? I mean
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:42.500]   No, I don't think so they have to give you a certificate or something. They do right. Yeah, okay. Oh
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.460]   That's right. That's right. Why the hell wouldn't they?
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.140]   Yeah, yeah
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.140]   Right why wouldn't they?
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.060]   Unless they get pressure from their partners
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.260]   Right, but I
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.500]   Even if it just does what it does right now. It's a very good by the way Netflix on it looks gorgeous
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.780]   Here's the one button. They've if they do this. It's a it's done is Amazon
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.620]   Yes, that would back to Amazon sold them
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.580]   Tolls me. There's a dolly ounce there. Yeah, cuz Amazon knows how many they sold. Oh, yeah
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:18.820]   So here's from Dan McDermott on Google plus a supervisor at Amazon told me I
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:27.740]   Ordered the last Chromecast and they had sold Amazon says half a million to 700,000 until they ran out on day two
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:35.020]   That's Amazon alone now Amazon's knows that number right you now
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:42.080]   Admittedly Amazon it's a little bit against Amazon's business. I don't know is it against their business model to put it on Chromecast
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.780]   I'm talking about Amazon streaming video
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:51.820]   No, how is that a good? No, it's they put it on my smart TV Panasonic does it everybody does it right?
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:58.420]   Yeah, I mean they're giving it. Yeah, I mean, you know if the Kindle app runs anywhere, right?
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.700]   Why wouldn't they want people to be able to watch their Amazon? It's streaming. I
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.660]   Bought a bunch of stuff on Amazon. It's a streaming. I want to actually be able to watch it wherever I want
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.860]   I mean why you know, why not and that's only gonna make me buy more stuff
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.940]   From Amazon if I know I can watch it anywhere well, if Amazon sold half a million, let's take the lower number
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.860]   Yeah, if they sold half of Google must have sold that many at least
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:26.900]   At least but you would think that they would probably have double what they're gonna give Amazon, right now remember we're talking about this in a universe where
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.020]   13 million Apple TVs have been sold total
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.340]   about five million Roku's total if
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:40.940]   You sold a million on the first week of anything. That's you're a player. That is something that is something
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.860]   And as always you don't know how much it coulda sold because they run out of
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:55.500]   Stock it's just it's such a lost opportunity, but this somebody pointed out. This is this is the this now we understand
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.860]   I don't think we said this last week now. We understand everybody made fun of when Eric Schmidt said by the summer of
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:06.660]   2012 little off there the majority of televisions you see in stores will have Google TV embedded in it
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.420]   now we're gonna be fun of that because
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.660]   We did laugh we should have laughed at it, but you know what?
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.700]   And we didn't understand how
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.700]   Yeah
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:26.540]   Another measure of its success is the fact that they're selling on Craigslist for 75 to 90 or eBay for 75 to 90 dollars
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:33.620]   That's up. It was when I when I blogged that it was 50 bucks. Yeah plus I hear and eBay UK
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.940]   People are trying to spend like 90 pounds. It would work in the UK. You can't buy it from the UK
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.060]   But I see no reason why it wouldn't work. Oh, yeah people from all their countries are trying to buy it
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.140]   I see that Netflix you'd have to have it, you know a special account
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:53.540]   But YouTube should work the tab things should work. I don't I doubt that it would I don't know would it check I
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.260]   Don't think it's where are you are you in England stop?
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:05.540]   Oh and people are selling them for more on eBay if you have the Netflix code
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:14.620]   It's worth 88 bucks if you get them that because that takes that takes 24 bucks off the yes, yeah
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.300]   By the way, I got the email if I get a code for each chromecast
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.820]   You can't apply them all at once but it sounds to me as if you could wait the three months and then apply the next one
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.700]   unless they expire them
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:33.460]   Because what I do I applied one and I have an existing account great next three months are free of Netflix
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.700]   Then I tried to play the next one I said you can only have one applied at a time
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:44.100]   But that did not apply it implied that I could then apply it later. How many family members can use a Netflix account?
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:50.060]   I don't know quite a few I we have separate logins for all my all my family members
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.300]   Oh for the for the same account. Yeah. Oh
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.900]   Yeah, that way
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:00.780]   Yeah, you don't get the same recommendations exactly. I don't want their recommendations. Oh, I didn't know you could do that. Oh
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.860]   The codes expire end of 2013. So I'll get at least six months
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:14.780]   So that's pretty good. So yeah, I count down to the people who are now gonna go on and start asking you for the extra codes
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.060]   I guess I should give those away shouldn't I because I bought five
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:25.140]   You know you want one reason why you sold I bet a lot of people bought multiple ones you want to buy accident, right?
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:31.380]   But I would I would I bought I bought I bought two and then saw you buying more and I went back and bought a third
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.700]   Because this is this is what men do
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.580]   If Leo has three, I'm gonna get three
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:46.340]   Well, I wanted one for every TV in my house. That's three and then I wanted and then I got two for Lisa because she's got two
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:54.380]   Because you know what happens and this is what you experienced at work. You get used to it. You know what it's great and I
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:02.380]   Unexpected you the Google music works with it and I and and and as Sundar whoever was talking said
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:08.060]   I do have my best stereo equipped in my TVs have are with the good stereo, right?
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.540]   So I can listen to my music. It's been great
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.380]   Yeah, that's cool. I haven't tried that yet and up and door to come
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.540]   Yeah, but even it's even I like you know, I really like the Google music radio
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:22.100]   Really? Yeah, it's great
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.260]   For and it just plays great and it because it's on your TV
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.820]   They put nice big album art up at first with all the information and then it shrinks down and there's a screen saver
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.420]   You you get a nice. It's even nicer than Pandora. It's beautiful
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:43.420]   I'm a cheapskate and when they charge me the 799 where when the for when the trial ended I was kind of like, uh, okay
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.740]   I'll keep it. I can't what I did is I canceled I canceled Spotify. So I saved a couple of bucks
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.220]   Mm-hmm. So do you see this post on GTV hacker that?
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:59.740]   That the Chromecast is more Android from OS under the hood. Yeah, it's a modified Google TV release
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.140]   Yeah, isn't that interesting it is yeah? Yeah, so we were talking about last night on all about Android, you know
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:11.220]   Why they chose to go with the chrome brand versus the Android or Nexus brand because they really said this is Chrome OS
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.860]   Didn't they yeah, they know the play is correct. It's next to the chrome devices
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.340]   It's probably semantic right because
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:27.580]   Chrome OS is very similar to Android from up, you know the bottom up. It's only the top layers that are different, right?
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.060]   Yeah, yeah, I guess it makes sense. I mean I
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.540]   Oh, I don't know look. I don't know what the with the internals of Chrome OS
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:39.100]   I'm not sure what the with the real low-level code is like how close Linux right it's a Linux kernel
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:45.700]   Linux right and so going up to that going up so it's you know the Linux kernel and then there's Dalvik on top of that
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   that's the job the Java
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.260]   engine right
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.780]   Is Dalvik on Chrome OS or is it just Android?
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.900]   No, well Dalvik is there to run the Java bytecode, right?
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:04.460]   So this is the Java run time. Yeah, that's a Java run time. They're not running Android apps here. This is just Chrome
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.300]   So it doesn't so if it doesn't have Dalvik, it's not Android. Well, yeah, I mean that's right
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.820]   That's a that's a good argument
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:17.340]   I mean for me it is a less of a technical discussion and more of a marketing brand discussion like how come they didn't decide to go with
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:24.260]   You know the the Nexus dongle or the Nexus. I don't know whatever versus the Chrome brand and a lot of people here's why
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.820]   TV brand has been terrible
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:33.860]   You know they want to sell it cross platform. They want iOS users to understand that they also can use it Chrome is cross-platform
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.860]   And Android is not
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:43.060]   But it was just an interesting branding choice. Isn't this isn't it this simple. It's an add-on to Chrome. It's a Chrome extension. Yeah
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.300]   Right also if you right communicates what you do with it more easily, right?
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.060]   You read I'm flinging this from Chrome. This is chrome to crime. That's I think that's what it is
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.700]   I think it's it's a chrome to Chrome. It's casting your chrome. Yeah, it's another it's a remote tab
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.100]   It's a remote chrome tab. It's actually you're right. I guess what I'm using Netflix
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.060]   That's not the case what I'm using you know, you drew players not the case
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.420]   But otherwise it wants me to say this is just an extension of your laptop folks
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:12.780]   Right, this is right. This is a tab and it doesn't and I'm reading the gtv hacker post
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.460]   It doesn't have dalvik or bionic on it. So it really is
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:22.620]   I mean, I think I think that semantics to say that it's more Android or more Google TV than it is
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:27.420]   Chrome OS if you have to just see the Linux Linux that's could be called Chrome OS
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.540]   Yeah, did you see the Easter eggs on little bice the hardware? He's no it's on the rundown
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.900]   I saw this in the rundown. I didn't get a chance to look at them looking at what is it?
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.980]   There's a Konami code some I did the Konami code. Yeah, I did that one
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:46.220]   But that's on the app. There's two others just looking up on the on the thing. Okay, because it's visual
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.700]   We got it. We got a demo it. Huh? Let me get let me get it here. No, no, no, it's a hard
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:55.340]   It's the first hardware you're saying Google's a hardware company. This is a hardware Easter egg. Wow
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.740]   Um scanning here
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.860]   The model number
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:07.020]   Yeah, okay, here we go. Here's three. So I want to go home now and wait a minute. No, I have one on my desk
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:12.060]   I'll do this here. All right, it's right there. Okay. Here's this is from uh, let's see. Okay
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.460]   Back up back up back up back up
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.060]   See me on the
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:22.540]   on the device device. There's an Easter egg if you zoom in a little bit
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.820]   You'll see oh, yes
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.820]   Somebody told me about this that the model number is h2 g2
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.300]   - 4 2
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:35.100]   Wait a minute now now let's test your geek knowledge if you really are a geek you should be able to identify
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.580]   what h2 g2
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:45.340]   - 42 is and I want to tell you when Jason told me about this yesterday identified it or uh, jeff or somebody identified it immediately
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.900]   If you're a geek you should be able to
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.740]   hitchhikers guide to the galaxy h2 g2
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:57.660]   And of course 42 is the answer to the question of life the universe life universe and everything. Yeah
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.140]   That is I love you google
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.860]   pretty great. It's pretty great
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.500]   You know, it doesn't take much
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   What also has a problem. Imagine any other imagine sony imagine somebody goes in and says boss
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:15.180]   You know on this new thing this walk band. I want to do this. I'll open a little joke on it. No you cannot
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:19.340]   Yeah, I mean every bit of harbor that you shipped have had has had some sort of Easter egg, right?
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.620]   So there's this in the chrome the pixel had the konami code
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:27.020]   Um even the cr48 had the uh that had that that hidden developer switch
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.420]   Kind of to unlock it, you know inside the bottom. I guess that wasn't really an easter egg
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:37.020]   But it was still kind of a neat little developer switch even their bids for the 700 megahertz spectrum
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.020]   Had saster eggs in it right there bid was pie
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:46.140]   Well, that's right. That's right 3.14159 billion dollars
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:51.340]   So there it is. Yeah, it's kind of hard to see but h2 g2. I verify that
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.820]   uh and the i c and the fccid
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:00.060]   And the model number all are in there. It's in the fccid
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:05.100]   Yeah, that's hysterical right now. You said that on the on the power adapter. There's something here
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.820]   Yeah, the power adapter is a model number
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.660]   Uh mstk 3 oh my god
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.860]   mystery science theater 3000
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.060]   Okay, okay you win
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.660]   You win resistance is futile
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.940]   This might be one of the best devices google shipped
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.060]   I can't decide the next seven or this the best device that google never ships
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.180]   Both got last week and I have to say it puts them in a position
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.980]   Gina Gina. I know
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.620]   The pixel
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.580]   Not even close
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.300]   I like it a pixel. I like it a pixel but
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.100]   Best taking price into
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.500]   Thank you
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:54.220]   Well do note that google does much better with products of similar capabilities when they price it amazingly low
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.220]   Because uh they didn't do too well with a q remember
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:04.060]   But the chrome casts at one tenth the price seems to have done quite well a pixel at 1500
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.820]   Not such a big seller, but uh you do it at 200 bucks or 50 bucks
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:14.460]   And chrome you know back back to your point about but be the hardware company who would think that google is a company would put out the best
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:19.660]   iterations isn't that interesting right and stand by because tomorrow
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.620]   at uh
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.140]   Starting in the morning and throughout the uh morning in New York City
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.740]   Google is going to finally take the wraps off of the modo x
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.980]   And I say google because google owns moderola and this is the first moder roll of phone
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:40.220]   If the people who are going to that thing are get walk kind of way with them and i'm not invited in and can't get one i'm pissed
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.180]   I know we got to get both you and Gina one because
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.460]   Well, I can't tell you why
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:56.700]   I hate it, but what we're going to do is uh the uh embargo is I have my tongue will be untied at noon pacific 3 p.m
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.380]   Eastern tomorrow
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.700]   So uh we're going to do a special i'm hoping we're going to get one between now and then uh we we
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.340]   Have been begging and pleading the whole time
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:10.860]   Um for all this suffering that this should be the price they put let me say this about that
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.900]   Yeah, yeah
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.380]   While there are many questions that I still have because I you know I played with it for an hour
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.620]   But I did not yet I didn't have a chance to use it as a real phone for a week or two
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.540]   So there's lots of things. I mean it could have terrible phone reception. I don't know the speakers could be muddy
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.540]   I don't know that stuff
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.980]   There's some questions in my mind about battery life. I wasn't able to use it long enough
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.620]   To verify, but I do have some initial impressions which i'll talk about tomorrow
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.980]   On battery life. I have some I have some knowledge about that
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.220]   um, it it seems it looks to me that this will be
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.660]   Very likely to be one of the best phones if not the best phone out there
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.260]   Wow
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.420]   For a number of reasons some of which have not been fully revealed yet
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.580]   But the studies are not that impressive
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.420]   Okay, let's talk about pc magazine sa's sa's sa'sha
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.620]   Segan
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:08.300]   Who is uh sa'sha? I I don't know if he's a boy or a girl
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.500]   Uh, but he does or she does very good
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.740]   Mobile stories. Let me see if I can find this story here
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.980]   um
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:24.700]   And it acts she says this as if i'm why am I getting a pop-up go away go away?
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.060]   Uh
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.900]   He says this as if he is revealing something that he's been
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:37.740]   Told it says the title is moda roller reveals more x8 chip details
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:41.500]   I cannot i'm told that I cannot confirm
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.180]   Uh
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:49.420]   Leaks until tomorrow or deny leaks until tomorrow. Well gosh Leo. What does that nice filler say that let me tell you what sa'sha
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.900]   And now that I see the picture, I'm pretty sure it's a guy
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.020]   Or it could be a really ugly girl, but
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.140]   uh
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.140]   he's
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.420]   He that's a dude. That's a dude, right? Okay, you never know
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.700]   Uh
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.700]   So so the x8 is in the droid ultra mini and max
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.780]   And he says it's anticipated to be under the hood of the new modo x can't confirm or deny that
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:20.220]   But listen to what he says and I think it might be germane the x8 is in the processor and it's not an soc a system on a chip
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:24.940]   It appears to be shorthand for combining a customized snap dragon s4 pro
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:31.100]   System on a chip. That's a quad core top of the line by the way that is not middle of the line snap dragon
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.060]   Uh with two with two additional
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.780]   custom dsps
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.980]   One of which can function essentially is a low power cpu
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:43.500]   Just how can listen to you all the time if it could do that. Hmm
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.260]   Uh
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.660]   He quotes iqbal arshat who's an engineer at motor role of senior vp of engineering
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:57.420]   If you look at the x8 mobile computing system iqbal says it has a cluster of processors and then some separate elements of the system
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:04.300]   The goal was to move away from a primarily cpu based architecture to save power and do quote intelligent
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.940]   probabilistic computing
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:13.980]   Ooh, ooh, not just listening to you, but anticipating certain things at certain times
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.780]   I don't know really what I don't actually know what he means
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.420]   How ballistic computing
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.820]   Well, this guy i'm going too far i'm sure because but i like you like wave
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.740]   um
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.540]   What that means to me is that google's intent is always to
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.900]   Into it your intent. Yeah, and so if it's constantly computing about you
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.860]   Well, remember what time it is, you know, it can do things remember what I said to brad
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.540]   if it's patrick was it patrick patrick or no it was uh, it was um
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:52.060]   Horowitz Bradley horowitz when we were leading google.io. I said boy, you know, it would be so cool if google did a google now
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.500]   Google plus phone
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.780]   become
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.100]   Yeah, hmm. That would be cool
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.540]   So I and he went to nudge and said yeah, just wait
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:08.460]   But I would guess that this that what what the what uh the next generation google
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.620]   Slash motor roll of phones and that now that google has a handset manufacturer
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:17.260]   It behooves them to put the nexus line on that manufacturer. I understand that they don't want to
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:24.860]   Piss off anybody but sam songs eating their lunch at this point and sam songs really making more and more noise about kind of going their own way
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.300]   They're having a developers conference in the fall
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.380]   Um, and I have to say I'm more and more dissatisfied the more I use the gs for the more
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.940]   It's crud it up
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:44.140]   And and every once in a while it overheats the battery just drains in a minute because there's something running on it that goo that sam song put on there
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.940]   The camera has never worked right from day one
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:53.100]   I just on sam song I think has gone down a very bad road and it would be it would be smart of google
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.700]   And not if i'm google i'm looking jeez, you know, we don't want this to represent us
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.660]   But it does to half of all smartphone manufacturers. They've got or buyers. They've got sam songs
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.100]   This is now becoming the face of androids synonymous with androids
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:09.660]   What are we going to do about that? And I think this is motor roller is the opportunity for them to at least say
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:15.020]   Here is what another way to go with androids would be this is the premium androids
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.580]   Perfect way to describe it
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:24.940]   Boy, that's the phrase they should be used the funny thing is premium equals pure not messed up with the things you add that you call premium
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:30.460]   Other companies. Yep. I was it. I was not a fan of a pure google experience for a long time
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.180]   But but but the 4.2.2 and later it's good
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:40.140]   Oh, it is i'm pretty sure it got a sam song phone and i was trying to help him with it because he couldn't try
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:44.780]   He saw eternal the rare horror and it was giving me a headache trying to get more of a Microsoft horrible
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:50.460]   So uh, and you know I talked to the guy on vented moto blur. I said why'd you do that to people?
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:47:00.140]   Really? Yeah, and he said he said I understand he said but at that time with with gingerbread
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:07.580]   And bird wasn't there yet. We really had to we felt we had to uh customize heavily to give consumers something they could use
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.820]   He said it's not that way anymore and I agree with him
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:18.140]   So I think that uh, I would expect I I'm not uh, I would just expect the moto x to be
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.100]   Exactly what you said google's uh kind of underscoring. I don't know if they'll call it an axis
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.780]   They probably won't but but this is the premium android experience is how it should be done
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:31.260]   And what better way to show that than google's premier mobile product google now
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.580]   Here's a question
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.820]   So if will will they sell it on the play store?
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:39.020]   Oh, definitely
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.380]   Why wouldn't they?
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:45.260]   Oh, they definitely say so but this seems to mean they're kind of saying nothing there if you go to the if you go to the motor
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   Roll a site is all boa del x
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.060]   I
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.820]   I mean, I can't imagine that they wouldn't
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:58.780]   Leo's got something about this. He's got something something something
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.940]   I'm sorry. Would you say I was just having a long drink of water
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:07.980]   We speculated a while ago that the reason why the hgc1 and the gs4 and the play store
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.540]   With like the google edition is the kind of their way to make nice nice preemptively make nice nice
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:20.060]   With these other manufacturers because now they're gonna hit with the modo x and it's gonna be the android phone to have
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:26.060]   So that's in the bar. I want it tomorrow. Yeah. Well, well, they'll announce it tomorrow
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:30.460]   I don't think it's available right away. I'm not sure but I think that you're gonna have to wait a little bit
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:36.380]   There there is a leak from what was that best buy or one of the uh retailers that said august 23rd
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.740]   Uh, so you're gonna you might have to wait a few weeks
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.380]   um
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.100]   This I have to say if sasha segan is right this x8 chip
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:51.340]   Means you can't compare head to head with other phones
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:56.140]   You know, you can't say well, that's a middle of the line chip or it's a middle of the line ram or it'll
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.780]   Because it's something different
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:06.860]   And I think they'd be smart to say look at apple says this all the time don't look at specks look at what we can do
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.700]   Um, you know, that's fair. That's fair. Right. We
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.060]   The spec you should look at is battery life and and how it integrates into my life. Does it work for me?
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.660]   Hmm
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.740]   So it's gonna be running for three right
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:25.420]   So with a leak say
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:29.820]   For three or 14 well, they'd be crazy to ship it with four two two, but I don't know right there would be
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.340]   That it's I can tell you this I could tell you this the phones we looked at had four two two on it
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.380]   But they hadn't announced four three yet. So yeah, okay
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.780]   uh, okay
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:44.940]   So if it were the google now version of facebook home, which is kind of what it sounds like it is
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.060]   the thing that sort of anticipates and listens and um
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:53.820]   I wonder if that they're gonna if they're gonna ship it with a with a special launcher or is it gonna be a special?
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.220]   I don't want to say skin because that sounds
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:01.900]   Too much like what we're complaining about. Yeah, I don't think I mean I think facebook home was a huge flop, right?
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.660]   Yeah
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.460]   So I think that they weren't they wouldn't do that
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.740]   You know I have google plus
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:14.220]   launcher I I think it's pretty clear people want access to the functionality of the phone
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.020]   Yeah, yeah now it was pretty accessible
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:20.300]   But but will google now have new capabilities
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:25.740]   Based on this phones new capabilities of being more aware always listening etc
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.380]   I mean, am I gonna say something to my wife and get a google now card with like news results?
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.500]   No, no, no, no, no
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.260]   I don't know I don't know for a fact, but if they did that that would be crazy
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:42.540]   What what I'm pretty sure is the case is that it's not listening online
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.460]   It's listening locally until here's the key phrase
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:53.980]   And then it then opens up a channel to the that was that was they were very clear without the base at it's not keeping track of what we're saying
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.060]   Oh, nobody would
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.500]   I was kind of joking, but you know I had this google now experiences past week
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:05.020]   So my terrible embarrassing shameful guilty pleasure right now on tv is
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.580]   Happened to me too. I know exactly what you're about to say
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.220]   What's your get what's your guilty pleasure?
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:15.420]   It's I'm really sorry ahead of time saying is the bachelorette. Okay. Oh, that's really sad
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.420]   I'm watching the bachelorette
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:22.860]   And guess who knows what she's watching yes because I of course search, you know
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:27.180]   There's a blogger who like basically spoils those seasons by saying who she chooses and I hate google
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.460]   The spoilers like a couple of days ago or at least a couple weeks ago
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.740]   I haven't done it in a while
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.820]   And then a new story about about the bachelorette came out and my google
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.460]   I picked up my phone and google now said
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:41.980]   There's a there's a new new story about the bachelorette spoilers
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:46.540]   We thought you'd be interested in here it is and don't you know that I tapped that card it worked
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:51.660]   And did you say at the time thank you google? Oh, I
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.100]   Thank you for spying on me. How did it know?
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.500]   I it was based on my searches searches like I searched for for
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:00.860]   Here's what I thought you were going to say
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.500]   So last night on my google now pops up and says oh, I see you have a tv online
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.860]   Would you like to
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.940]   Whoa on the google now it's not here anymore because I swiped it away
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.660]   But on the google now it says you have your panasonic vieres online
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.380]   Because they're both on the same wi-fi network
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.980]   and
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.700]   And then press this button to see so we can see what you're listening to
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.860]   And I didn't said no, sorry you could it will you can only identify live tv?
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.820]   I was watching the soprano so they said we can only identify live tv
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.220]   But had I been watching the bachelorette
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:38.700]   It would have given you get would have to do it done like actors or whatever they're not actors on that show but but yeah
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.860]   Yes, they are
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.340]   Gina do not deceive yourself
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:46.460]   And professional wrestling is not real Gina
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:53.260]   They're not in love and they don't hurt each other but but but but what's good. Yeah, it would be funny if it said
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.460]   Really Gina is that what you're watching? I really wish that the card had judged me like really
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.740]   I would have accepted that I would have fully accepted that
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.300]   From any hall
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.700]   And and you're standing in the movie line and some jerk is talking about Marshall McLuhan and the phone comes up and says no
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.700]   He's wrong. He just knows working all
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.020]   Oh love that
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.540]   Would love it. Yeah, they so what this would have done is listened to the audio
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.300]   Said and I did press the button and it listened to the audio and said I don't know what this is
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:26.060]   But you have to be watching live TV and I said, oh, that's why it's the sopranos. It's a it's a 13 year old tv show
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:30.700]   It doesn't know from that. I was wondering I thought what this interesting would they have
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:35.820]   Audio clips from you know audio from every tv show ever broadcast would that be cool
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:41.260]   So so I understand so would listen to the audio and then so would know what you're watching and then what well
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.260]   I presume a card would pop up with information
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:48.620]   Information about yeah and forever more because now it goes. Oh, yeah, you watch the bachelor
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.860]   Uh, why don't we pop up a notification on your calendar
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:57.260]   Now one of the nice things about now is you can always swipe it away and say I don't want to see that anymore
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:04.460]   Yeah, yeah, so hey there's a new season starting. Oh, hey, there's yeah, there's special. There's another show going on. Yep. Yeah. I think that's great
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.500]   I don't mind giving him that information
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:14.380]   Despite the the shame that I felt tapping on the car. No, it's great. It's great and google knows that people surf the web while they watch tv
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:18.300]   Right? So does that happen? So now here's a question if I watch something on chrome cast
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:21.900]   Is it gonna start showing up in google now? Of course it is
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.180]   Google knows right google knows
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:28.540]   This is a question. I mean, I assume that google knows it has something
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:33.980]   Well, that's the whole point of this unified privacy policy they implemented back, you know, whatever year or two ago
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:39.100]   By the way, just in case you didn't know it all of our services are sharing information
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.460]   Yeah, what difference does it make because the nsa knows anyway?
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:46.540]   Uh, I'm not worried about the uh about the google when you got the nsa to roll right
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:54.460]   Um from from a technical standpoint though. I mean you're on the same wifi network and it's all happening locally. Google doesn't have to know
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.900]   Yeah, but don't you think it's interesting that google now knew that my tv
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:04.300]   Was I mean it it saw my tv it knew yeah, it's not your tv on your local wifi network and it told it's just yeah
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.980]   And google now pushed down from the cloud. Yeah, they're watching they know what's going on
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.060]   No, don't say it that way because it implies there is a human watching
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:17.500]   The algorithm it's algorithmically noting what we're doing and providing us with information based on that and I don't
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.220]   Have the same problem with that and you know what's interesting?
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.540]   I don't even have the problem if it were judgmental because I wouldn't mind if this phone kind of had a personality
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.140]   Yeah, and I kind of could kind of interact with it. It could be my new friend
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:33.740]   I could tell google now scold me when i'm watching the bachelor at wouldn't that be funny?
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.300]   All the other things that I could be doing during the bachelor
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.180]   In a fun way
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.180]   If it didn't in a fun way, yeah, well
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.260]   If you could get down get down yeah like a fun editorial voice and and you could tell it hey
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.740]   Stop me from doing this or or encourage me, you know to do this if i'm at the gym
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.540]   You know give me kudos, but if i'm watching the bachelor at like kick me in the butt
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:59.980]   How far is that from putting a reference to mystery science theater 3,000 on the serial number on the power supply?
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:04.700]   It's not far google already is starting to sneak editorial voice into everything
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:09.740]   And probably with an eye towards yeah, be kind of fun. That's a personality
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.180]   You could choose the personality. Yeah. Yeah
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.540]   I would do that. I don't know if i'd sell it certainly follows right?
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.860]   I mean, you know the latitude all the data that allowed it to
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.540]   Collecting on you right and that you knew i spend this much time at work this much time at home
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:25.740]   Right? I mean that's that seems like bigging that data useful to
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.540]   To the user and saying hey
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.860]   Here's what you should do with this stop watching the bachelor at that
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.420]   used that was
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.420]   You take that from extreme
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:41.580]   This will freak people out, but at some level there are predictors about things like depression
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:47.900]   Right could cheer you up because you're lonely. It could or could warn you it could make you aware of it
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.140]   You're sleeping it off a lot. Are you okay?
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:56.860]   Yeah, yeah, well, I mean, why do you think I have my scale tweet my weight? It's humiliating
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:04.220]   But the reason I do it is because I want support from my network of friends who and and acquaintances and people i've never met
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:07.020]   Who'll say hey, yeah, it's getting a little you're getting a little chunky
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.300]   I get that a lot
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.380]   I mean, you're also on live video all day long. Yeah, I'm sure you get a lot of
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.420]   I do and it's good. I don't mind that i'm used to it now
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.300]   Leo, we'll be doing shows soon on a treadmill
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.540]   Yeah
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.780]   Oh, believe me. I mean i'm sitting there this you know i'm
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:30.380]   I was eating I was eating tomato soup yesterday and dr. mom in the chat room says and you know that's full of caramel hindrains
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:35.820]   I said what no it's soup. She said, you know a tomato is a fruit
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.180]   So, you know what I did I googled in nutrition information
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:46.620]   Well, you've got an amazing community here. I want dr. mom in my phone. Well, yeah
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:53.100]   Well, yeah, and you can pay dr. mom can make money for this she could yeah
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.940]   Uh, yeah, let's work it
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.580]   I I'm feeling
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.260]   Maybe I have been brainwashed at this point
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:11.580]   Uh, and you know as a journalist I really uh, I really want to maintain my objectivity and my integrity
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.900]   But I I can't help but be very and I I hate to admit it
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:22.060]   Very excited about what I see coming out of google right now. Yeah. Yeah, same here. I don't want to like it
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.420]   I want to find something wrong with it. Um
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.140]   Well, and something else you can get mad about
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.540]   What's that? Although they they responded
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:36.940]   Uh, their terms of service for google fiber and neutrality. Yeah, this bugs the hell out of me
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:41.180]   But they they had an answer and said knowledge is standard stop, but they shouldn't be standard
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:48.460]   So, uh, if you have google five you're lucky enough to have google gigabit fiber in uh, and of course that would be in kansas city
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:51.500]   Uh soon provo utah in austin, texas
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:55.420]   Dan benjamin by the way was glowing about that
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:01.020]   Uh when he was in here on sunday, yeah, we're gonna get that actually would be a competitive advantage for
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.100]   him
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.620]   Son of a
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.860]   Oh stop laughing. Whose side are you on?
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:13.820]   Uh, but in the terms of service. Thank god. He's not allowed to create a server
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:20.460]   Uh, now it is true google says well everybody does that calm cast won't let me run a server or a mail server or web server
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:25.020]   But you know, there's all kinds of servers if you're running a minecraft server or
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:30.380]   Instead it came back and said no we don't non-commercial games home monitoring a lot of stuff is fine
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:35.260]   Well, but who's to make the you know, it's up to a google employee to decide i run a drop cam
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:38.540]   We're running drop cams here those are servers so i can see my camera
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:42.380]   Um lots of stuff is servers. What will what is google saying?
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:49.500]   Oh, you're trying to get me to actually give you information. Oh, no, no, man. I'm just I think that what there's
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:55.340]   It's I hate this where well, we got the rule, but don't worry. We're not going to enforce it. Pisses the hell out of me
[00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:01.100]   Because that's not how it works. He says google he google whoever says
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.060]   Uh, we're not violating net neutrality
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:09.980]   Well, yes, you I guess you are. I mean, I look any commercial service
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:17.820]   And any web I certainly don't complain that calm cast does this any anybody who offers internet service can I think quite reasonably say
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:23.980]   Look, we don't want you running a mail server because you could be a spammer or running a web server because there's security issues
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:28.380]   From your house. We're not you're not we're selling this for non commercial use
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:33.740]   That I don't think that's unreasonable, but for security issue of running a web server from your house
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.900]   Um
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.700]   Well, there are all sorts of issues with you know, since you're running a server you're letting people into your home network
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.500]   So it's a security issue for you
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:47.180]   Uh, it's a security issue for them because they're in effect
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.180]   Hosting
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:55.340]   Uh server and if you're serving malware, they're they're serving malware. Okay, if you're sending spam, they're sending spam
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.900]   Right, but but Leo if i'm
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.060]   Comcast or google whichever one
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:04.940]   Um on the exact same network on the exact same service if i have a business
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:10.700]   I'm sure i'm allowed to run a server. Well, that's what google says we do offer a business class
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:15.020]   And what what what yeah, but that's that's where that's where it's quizzling of them. What's the actual?
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:21.980]   Technology difference then if i'm joe's bagel shop. Well, you're paying more for the you're paying more for the business class
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.580]   That's that's the quizzling party is oh for something that actually doesn't cost us anything more
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.500]   We're gonna charge you more because we can that's what cable companies do this. That's what google should do
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:33.820]   That's the essence of net neutrality. Well, that's and that's that's why it bothered me
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.140]   I understand when Comcast does that there's even technical reasons why they might want to do that
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:41.020]   But google's supposed to be a little you know stand up for now
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:46.540]   This is their response to ours technicals article google is a strong supporter of the open internet
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.540]   And our stance there here hasn't changed. This is a standard practice of network
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:57.020]   Management and as we said in our filing the policy does not prevent legal and non-commercial use of applications
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.980]   Such as multiplayer gaming video conferencing and home security
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:06.620]   Uh, you know, there's lots of service sling boxes a server. There's lots of servers people run in their home. Yeah, there's this is
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:11.580]   That's such a cop-out. They need to stand up and define what they're talking about here
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.940]   Everything is a server. Everything should be a server, right? I mean
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.380]   You're refrigerated because a server, right? Right?
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:25.180]   Everything should be a server. I run a server on my I do development web development for the Chromecast is a server
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:30.220]   I mean, you know to to some I mean it's at least it's a peer. It's a node. I don't know
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:35.980]   This is this is BS. We should call them out on this. They should read they should re-write what exactly they mean by server
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.540]   They should define what they need by server. Google gets in trouble, right?
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:43.260]   Things that I haven't liked the Google's done. Number one was China number two was the net neutrality
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:48.060]   Quizzling act with the devil's deal with Verizon and number three is this kind of stuff
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.420]   When they when they think they're operating at an industry level, they act like a company when they're operating
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:57.420]   Person-to-person they try to be decent. Sorry. That's my lights. They're run by Comcast
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:02.060]   Well, and you understand though that
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:06.700]   Even if it becomes an even more in an issue when you're selling a lot of
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:12.940]   Bandwidth especially a lot of symmetric bandwidth, you know, we're giving you a gigabit the temptation to run a server
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.060]   I pay a lot of money for a gigabit from soft layer
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.780]   The temptation is high
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.140]   A gigabit I could for instance have a radio station
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.100]   And and the long run
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.900]   What you should I wrote about this and what would Google do
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:34.220]   You should look at your a googly cable company. I said actually I should go back to this now and compare and contrast
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.740]   A googly cable company would be an enabler of your creations
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.780]   Yes, and and it would be a good thing for everybody
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.620]   Exactly
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.660]   Now maybe what they should offer is and say listen
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:53.420]   We've got a more secure better solution. We have Google's versions of AWS, which we're going to make ready for prime time and ready for
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.900]   a plain old people at home
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.260]   and
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:01.580]   We're not going to charge you more. We'd like you to use that and create stuff and the more content you create the better is for Google
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.980]   Hallelujah, you know, but we don't want to go after invest in the in the
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:11.020]   Last mile of our network, right? Okay, but but from a from a
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.900]   Service perspective they should be trying to encourage people to make stuff and to do more
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:23.820]   And certainly is there right is a commercial entity not to do that but uh, we would we would ask more from of them
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:30.860]   I guess you know, maybe they say something like we'd uh, you know, if you have a publicly accessible server that has more than
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:37.020]   10,000 concurrent connections, please contact us about a business, you know or more than a thousand connections, you know
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.500]   Contact us about a business plan if it just seems like they could be a little more
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:48.460]   Specific about what it is that they don't want because everything is a server at this point. Uh, so that that's crazy
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:57.020]   Yeah, I mean you could be you could certainly write language that would protect them against the stuff they don't want without being so blanket
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:04.460]   So there we're gonna be pure. No, and I suspect what they'll do is uh, they'll you know, every company does is the default is
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:09.340]   Yeah, or you can't do that and then and then if push comes to shove. All right
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:15.340]   All right, we can write this in such a way that everybody's gonna be happy that that will protect our our network from crazy people
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.940]   And uh, but still give you because you're right. There's a real advantage
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:24.220]   to uh, fostering the idea of everybody putting stuff out there
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:30.540]   Yeah, Google will learn more about the process. You know say we'll learn more about the process. We're all happy. Yeah
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:37.100]   All right, well, they can rewrite their terms of service. We ask you to do that. Please google. Thank you
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:43.020]   Yeah, we ask you to do that. I want to phone as soon as possible. I want to know when the heck the nexus seven
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:49.580]   Is coming out with the LTE and then finally my friend den gilmore email today and said oh
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.580]   they're offering um
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:56.780]   Uh further invitations to get one on google glass and he wanted my invitation and I don't have one google
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.500]   Oh, they said that they're gonna give some explorers
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:06.460]   Uh invitations like for a second person either. Yeah, but I think that that hasn't happened, but they're they're coming to that point
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.260]   So gilmore actually said give me one
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:15.740]   Yeah, like he actually asked for yeah, he asked for one of your up your invitations. He's like, hey, I'm ready
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.460]   You got an invitation
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:26.540]   You know what I give dan a pass because he wrote a very very strong commentary on the guardian that I really supported yesterday
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:30.540]   About why the Bradley Manning verdict is still bad news for the press
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:37.020]   It is awful news and he was very outspoken and I think made a very strong case dan used to work at the sanazone marketing news
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.580]   Decided to foster cities and journalism and has really been a good voice out there
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.420]   um
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.540]   He called the abama administration the most secretive
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.500]   administration of our time and I think I'd agree with that
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:59.820]   Um, and they're really we're he's quoted jeremy scale saying we're in a moment when journalism is being criminalized
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:07.980]   Yes, and uh, I agree with that and uh, it is it is something to really pay attention to the why why does our
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:14.220]   Government believe that uh, it needs to crack down on investigative journalism
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:20.220]   This is the government that is serving us that is elected by us to serve us. This is our government
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:24.380]   It is our right to know what they're doing. They're working more and more in secrecy and
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:30.380]   Uh, it's still charged under the espionage act. They called sharing information wanton publishing
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:34.300]   They called taking the government's own information, which is the information of the people stealing it
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:41.020]   Uh, these are these are all very dangerous things and at a time when we now know thanks to Edward Snowden
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:47.980]   The depth of the overreach that government is making the need for having watched dogs and whistleblowers being so great
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.020]   For the government to crack down to this level is
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.780]   tyrannical
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:59.100]   He says and this is I agree with this 100 percent the abama administration's war on leaks and by extension the work of investigative reporters
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:04.620]   Who dare to challenge the most secretive government in our lifetimes has been unrelenting
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:10.460]   Obama has charged more reporters and more people with uh violations of the espionage act
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.700]   Than any president that all the presidents all of combined combined
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:21.740]   So if I may leo uh to do a little plug here, I some folks tweeted me and I saw this and it's a last minute thing
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.100]   But if you go to 1984 day.com
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.740]   You'll find that there is a series across the country of
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:36.220]   Protests against the nsa this sunday good. Uh, you'll find the times now the germans beat us to this
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.420]   Under the hashtag stop watching us. They had demonstrations in 39 german cities
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:44.700]   You know the day, uh, and it's shocking that we have
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:50.300]   Not the reaction here that they have there, but at least these folks are organizing this and I think it's important
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:58.060]   I did I think did on on um scurrying now. Did you go through the guardians revelations today that we did
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:03.580]   Yeah, why don't you why don't you talk a little bit about this? Well, it's it's called uh, no, i'm forgetting the name of an x
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.300]   Uh x no what what's it called?
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.900]   I can't remember let me look at it. It's there. It's there. It's there. No, it's on the it's on the rundown
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:15.420]   I'm forgetting x key score x key score and the and and so the guardian revealed when reynwald
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:19.740]   From stoden revealed the powerpoint that trained people in this
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:24.220]   And what this shows pretty clearly is how right steve was
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.500]   Well, what was happening because this is not about direct connections to servers
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.740]   This is about them having everything we do. This is about them having a
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:36.940]   Cash of three to four days of every ht tb request there is
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:43.260]   and and that then becomes searchable by any bozo working for booz allen
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:47.980]   And the standard of of saying oh, we think it's a foreigner. Okay. I go ahead
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.460]   Uh is is minor
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:56.540]   And the but while shocking is the amount of information that they have about us and it's stored in servers around the world
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.900]   Which I wonder if that's not a violation of uh various laws
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.220]   Uh and and within there in the language of it, there's just all kinds of
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.900]   Scary stuff about what they know and what they can do
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:14.700]   Um and and again this can't come from just saying it's not like they just have access to
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:18.940]   One thing that the direct connection to the server's issue is not here at all
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:20.300]   This is about
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:25.020]   This is the fruit of them having a direct link into the raw feed of the internet
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.580]   And they're and they're and they've got the metadata there and so you can do a search and find me
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:30.860]   um
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.460]   Things that are written in german in coming out of a ran
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:39.820]   Uh spreadsheets that have mac numbers in them that da da da da da da
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.740]   uh
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.740]   anomalies of
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.980]   VPN connections that are opened under these circumstances
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:53.820]   And they were concerned that so much activity on the internet was basically anonymous
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:54.780]   Anonymous
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.780]   So they said well all right
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.460]   Then we don't really have to have an email account or a
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.580]   Anything attached to the activity. We'll just collect it
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:08.300]   Right, so we don't need know who you are. We don't need to know that we're gonna we're gonna find out anyway
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.140]   Then we can go back if we you know that then
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.660]   That's what they say. Uh, huh. We know enough. We know what's happening to this IP address
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:18.460]   Let's go to google and and and with a war information and get that out of
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:23.340]   But it's uh, it's really sobering stuff. I think it's a bombshell
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.500]   Uh, and you know the government's not going to be happy about it
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:32.300]   By the way, I should say in full disclosure that I am now back advising the guardian
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.660]   Good
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:38.780]   Oh good for you, jeff kudos to the guy, you know when you look at these these are true these slides are training slides
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:44.540]   For it might as well be a video at mcdonald's. Yes for oh
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:50.460]   By the way, just remember that the x-key score parses out everything it thinks is an email address
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.620]   So don't be fooled by miss hits
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.620]   you might it's like
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:00.780]   Any idiot can be trained to use this and apparently they are training idiots to use it and
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:06.780]   As snoedon said that means they can in real time monitor anybody from the president of the united states on down
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.580]   And man if i'm a member of congress and I read this I should I would be quaking in my boots because
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.500]   If you're a member of the so-called loyal opposition
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.100]   How long before they start looking at what you're up to oh, yeah?
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.860]   Oh, yeah
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860]   If you passed this bill
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:27.900]   You gave them permission to look at all your emails all your phone calls everything you're doing
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:35.340]   and uh, and how long you think before uh an administration decides that that congressman is not on our side
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:40.700]   We better keep an eye on him or that journalist or the connection or or somebody trying to call the journalist
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.700]   There's the number of ways you can talk talk to a journalist now are greatly reduced
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:50.940]   They hold a rolling buffer of approximately three days of all unfiltered data all
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:54.620]   In case or fraud taken from the collection side the collection sites
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:59.740]   We now know our places where they tap right into the net facebook microsoft
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:05.820]   Google yahoo massive distributed lennis cluster over 500 servers distributed around the world
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:11.100]   The system can scale linearly simply by adding a new server to the cluster
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:18.540]   Um, my favorite part was they have they have a map where the servers are and there's a whole line of them across an arctic
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:25.020]   And I said what the hell's that and somebody uh in twitter speculated that those are servers in classified locations
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.540]   Um
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:33.260]   It's just our internet explorer
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:38.140]   Yeah, well, it's probably secure. It's probably iE6
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:44.780]   This is for 2012 so they they have age what they're saying they explain why should you be interested in hdb
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:47.900]   Because most people do most of what they do with hdb you should know what they do that
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.660]   Uh
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:55.660]   So x keyscore connects unique data beyond user activity from front end full take feeds front end
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.380]   full take feeds in other words, we scoop it all up
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:05.740]   How do i tell a terrorist that has no connection to known strong selectors answer look for a non-mulus events
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:10.460]   ege someone whose language is out of place for the region they are in someone who's using encryption
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:14.620]   Someone searching the web for suspicious stuff. Now what this means all of us
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.580]   When they went back to the earliest
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:23.260]   Nsa warrantless wiretapping, you know, I argued at the time and this is still born out now
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:26.700]   But what they were really looking for was a baseline so they could look for anomalies
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.580]   Right
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:32.860]   And the anomalies are the things that you thought might make you safe like oh, let me get let me get a burner phone
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:39.980]   Anomaly now they do say in this article that they claim they've caught 300 terrorists using this technology
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:44.540]   Yeah, but at the same time leo at the same time today before I before i heard in congress
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.660]   uh clapper from the the dc I
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:52.300]   released or unclassified some documents about the the foam record collection
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:59.500]   And and then the stories about that they were first they all we caught lots of terrorists and then basically they got down to essentially like one case where it was
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.780]   At all directly related to this what they're saying constantly is no no it's the whole picture all this stuff together
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.940]   We're catching lots of terrorists. We're stopping lots of plots
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:13.980]   But there's no accountability here at all that says well show me that go well. We can we can't even tell you who the enemy is
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:19.420]   Well, and you combine that with the unprecedented attacks on journalists by the abomin administration
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:24.700]   I think we know who the enemy could very well be very soon and out of um, that's chilling
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.700]   Yes
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:30.460]   Now there's one other thing to mention and I forget who was said uh
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:36.460]   By the way, there are some blacked out slides here. You really want to know those are I think those are about you know what they caught
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.860]   uh, there's reference to tau here
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:44.780]   Uh fingerprints from tau are loaded into x key scores application fingerprint id engine
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:51.180]   And tau has been something that's been very secretive involving the chinese and watching servers and that kind of stuff
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:55.980]   But they talked about show me all the exploitable machines in country x. I explain that to me leo
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.860]   What is an exploitable machine? Is that mean one that we have
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:02.380]   Well, almost all machines are exploitable
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:08.860]   Uh because it means tat you we can we can take control of that machine using a variety of malware attacks or other systems
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:15.100]   So that says that we have a lot of machines that we have put the stuff on it doesn't say exploited. It says exploit a bull
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.100]   Yeah
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.300]   So I don't know
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.940]   Uh, I would say most machines are exploitable
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:25.660]   Well operating systems with known exploits that could get them as far as they go right right
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.700]   Right, so probing just what what versions how how patched it is and then is this exploitable?
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.980]   Yeah, this is good. You have those ready just in case you need them
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.940]   Yeah
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:41.900]   Really future slide future slide. This again was this this presentation was in 2012
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.740]   um
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:46.220]   High speeds better presentation. They need that
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:51.980]   Entity extraction so that you know, it's gonna give us the system is gonna get smarter. It's gonna know entities
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.980]   It's gonna know places and people and things
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.020]   Voip
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:55.980]   Yeah
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.220]   So they're bragging that they're gonna be able to do all this with a Voip
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:02.940]   And so on so I you know enough on the on the dystopian view of the world today
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:07.340]   But I but I just wanted I'm glad we've talked about this to bring it up because it's it's scary and important stuff
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:12.620]   Well, and we know a lot I know a number of programmers have been approached by the federal government to design systems like this
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.700]   really, oh, yeah
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.260]   uh
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.700]   And you know
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:21.740]   Technology has really taken huge leaps and strides and if you if your goal is
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.180]   To get better at sifting through vast amounts of data
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:28.940]   Uh to find things, um, then you're in your boy
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.820]   You're right on the curve because big data is huge right now
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.380]   and a lot of people are experts in this
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:41.180]   And I got a I got to figure that the nsa and others in the federal government have access to some of the best programmers in the world
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.180]   And that doesn't surprise me
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:46.860]   That they'd have these capabilities and expect them to get better and better rapidly
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.900]   In my field, you know, we have constant
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:55.260]   Ridiculous circle-jerk discussions about about ethics and what's right and what's wrong, but it's it's a good thing
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.620]   We should do that. I'm not the one people. I'm a drill as professor. It's okay. I like doing that
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.220]   um
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:05.660]   But but we have a lot of talk about the codes that we have in this field and we're constantly adjusting them and figuring them out
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.940]   Is there that kind of discussion in your world of developers?
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:13.900]   Is it is it mature enough yet to say hold on folks? We need a field of developer ethics
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:20.460]   I absolutely think that that we could have that and we should have that and I don't think that the conversation happens very much
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:25.820]   In fact, uh, my my co-founder, Anil dash at a food camp a couple of years ago did a session
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:31.260]   Uh, where he's basically like, okay, the software that we hate, you know, Facebook or whatever
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:37.820]   You know, we're bringing up some examples of of of things gone gone wrong. It's like we have to take responsibility
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.500]   For that
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.620]   Uh, if you you know if you build something that's being misused for whatever reason like that's that's on you
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:49.900]   And we have to take responsibility for the way that we decide to spend our time even if a big company is paying us
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:54.060]   In order to do that. Uh, and and it's funny. We we had this
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:57.180]   This talk and there were a couple like stricken faces in the room
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.620]   It was really it was interesting, right?
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.540]   Because it's easy, you know, it's easy for nerds we get paid very well
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:08.460]   We're very very smart and who are very taken with the challenge, you know
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:13.660]   As particularly a very complex challenge like like big data, um, you know that that big data presents
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:18.300]   To sort of separate yourself from how you know the morality and the ethics of it, right?
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:22.700]   Um, so I think it's a discussion that needs to happen more. I don't think it happens very much
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:29.340]   I mean, niel and I talk about it a lot, um, and I think more developers and more product designers in general should talk about it
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.100]   I mean, you know, there's just been the conversation going on about, you know, silicon valley startup
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:38.300]   Startups making products that are targeted toward young rich silicon valley
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:43.900]   Uh, startup people right and like, you know, should should people be spending their time and talent resources
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:51.020]   In particular in the venture capital community as well funding things that that are meaningful and ethical and make sense and try to make the world a better place
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:56.700]   Versus making another uber yet another dry cleaning delivery service or whatever
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:01.740]   So i'm happy when I start to see those discussions happen a little bit more, but I think it I think it could happen more
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:07.660]   Um, and uh, I think it would be useful for it certainly not the level that journalists have these discussions
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:14.060]   Well, but it probably issues these days too because we have your native advertising and and sponsored content and all this stuff and
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:17.100]   Uh, you know, the issues of publications
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.300]   Trying to fool readers by presenting things
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:26.300]   Advertiser content paid content as if it's as if it's their content and affecting their brands and then the separate
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.700]   Discussion that we have about individual journalists because a lot of journalists now, but we graduate from here
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:35.420]   And it worked they they're taking media skills with them and those are skills that they could use
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:42.060]   To the end of journalism or to the end of pr advertising and when I was it when I was in a young pup
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:49.420]   Uh in the industry basically if you left to go to pr, it's like you married a goi and you were dead to us
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:55.420]   Yeah, I'm you you still feel that way by the way you were you were you you had shown yourself
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:59.660]   And you've gone over to the dark side to modernize the reference
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:06.460]   And that's not true now in the field and and I had a discussion with my students about about ethics of native advertising and all that
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:11.420]   And and I realized when I had that discussion I did it way too late in the term and I should have done it earlier
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:13.980]   In fact, I was being um
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:18.540]   I was being observed that week because I I was going through the process of getting promoted to full professor
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.500]   And and that was the week so it was in there and i'm thinking oh my god
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:25.660]   Were they gonna think I turn out all these students who don't have the you know the core ethics
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.460]   That we had that we supposedly instill
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:34.940]   And it required it's a more difficult thing now because the lines are fuzzier. So if i'm seeing that in a very mature
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:37.580]   field like mine
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.580]   It strikes me that there's and and timber
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:43.420]   Is we talked about the need for web studies as a field of of of academic perspective?
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:48.860]   Good idea. Yeah, I think it is but I think part of that is is technology ethics ethics. Yeah
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:53.820]   Well, if you you know, I hate to leave people with a bad taste and a feeling of helplessness
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:57.660]   So please there is a way you can do something about this as jeff mentioned
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.620]   Protests are going to be occurring august 4th
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:05.100]   Sunday the rally against unconstitutional surveillance you could find out more at
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:08.940]   84 day calm. I think the more people who peacefully
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:16.860]   Protest this the more members of congress will sit up and take notice the other thing you can do and you can do right now is go to eff
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:18.220]   org
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:23.980]   Contribute email they have information on how you can write to call and otherwise contact your member of congress
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:31.580]   I think that's a good place to focus and certainly support eff I do financially every single
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:37.340]   Month and I'm a sustaining subscriber. It really is a great organization. They do a lot of good for all of us
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:41.740]   eff.org and 1984 day.com
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:46.860]   Gosh, I hate to
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:51.820]   Anything else before we go to our tips and tools and numbers there's so much so much news
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:58.060]   But I think that was a very important topic. So I'm glad you brought it up jeff. Oh, I was bringing bring it down. That's why well
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.940]   You know, it's a good. It's a really good. It's a really good topic
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:07.580]   Oh, how about this one? Hey, this is nice. Samsung apparently has been caught fudging the numbers
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:15.020]   Um, this is an old long standing trick. I can remember back to the days of zd labs
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:21.180]   Companies would do this all the time once you've designed a synthetic benchmark to test the speed of devices
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:25.020]   The very first thing companies start doing is looking for the benchmark
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.920]   And then my then changing behavior in this case
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:35.500]   Clocking the processor when the benchmark is running an antec discovered this they were going through the data on
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.620]   some benchmarks of the
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:42.700]   Octa core the exa-nose that's the international version of the galaxy is for happens to be the one I have
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:50.860]   And uh, they discovered multiple benchmarks that run those devices at higher cpu and gpu clock speeds and they normally run
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:54.860]   Samsung apparently said, ah, you're running the benchmark
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:01.180]   Let me just turn up the speed Samsung's response says no, that's what the gs4 does
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:07.100]   It runs at a higher clock speed on full screen apps and benchmarking apps just fall into that category
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:14.460]   Uh, of course the code was called or the program was called benchmark booster. That's kind of a giveaway
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:17.260]   kind of
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:22.700]   You press me
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   Uh
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.660]   Benchmark booster, maybe they should have named it something a little different. I don't know
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:39.100]   Um, they say that benchmark apps may in fact run at higher clock speeds in some games, but that's uh, that's just how it is
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:43.020]   That's how that's that's how great the phone is. It's just how they operate
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:49.500]   Uh, it's a shame if samsung is doing that there but it's something it's a long-standing tradition. I can remember for many years
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.220]   uh companies doing that in the pc market
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:57.500]   Um, and you know you get caught it's very hard to do that and not get caught in thanks to the
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.700]   Super smart guys at an on-tech. They are the best
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:03.500]   Yeah, that's a great side. They caught it right away. So
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.460]   Stop that
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:11.420]   But you know bench there's lies damn lies and there's benchmarks. There's no reason to believe benchmarks
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.620]   It's really how it feels in your hand. That's what really matters, right?
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:18.140]   On the list I
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:22.300]   Interested in ups is going to test 3d printing in stores
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:24.140]   the uh
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:30.140]   United parcel service. Yeah, so your ups store. Well 3d printing there. Wow. Is that interesting?
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:33.020]   Is that? Yeah
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:38.460]   That is really interesting. Oh, yeah, you could send somebody a 3d model. You could send somebody a thing
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:40.620]   Yeah, wow
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:44.540]   Really? Is that the point? I mean, right? That's that's gotta be it
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:49.980]   Here's that part you needed. It's a part you needed exactly. Yeah. I mean as much as I love you
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.940]   I love the maker bot. It's just it's still it's like three grand or whatever. I just you know for everyone to have a 3d printer is
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:00.460]   You know, we're not there yet. So it makes sense that ups or a ups store would do it
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:04.940]   I'm right last store in the other you know, that is so funny
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:07.180]   Beginning in the San Diego area
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:11.900]   Well, I'm gonna send you something. I'm gonna send you something Gina as soon as they're open
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:15.500]   Send you a twit hat
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.300]   Yeah, you don't mind wearing a plastic hat do you?
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:23.740]   Leo head. I want something something to the twit logo something. That'd be really fun
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.380]   She never see the phrase beginning in the San Diego area
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:34.860]   Somebody for ups wants to take some good business trips web 6825 wants jeff to a 3d u a cronut
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:37.740]   Oh
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:42.860]   Croonette oh man now what they need is a scanner in the other ups store
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:48.300]   So you could put a cronut in there. It scans it sends it to San Diego and then makes it
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:54.060]   Yeah, yeah teleportation. We're getting close the future is almost here
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:57.980]   How exciting
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.060]   Uh, let's see
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.460]   You tried yet
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:07.020]   You know boy Brett got a lot of attention that just shows you how much love and respect in the community
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:13.340]   There is for Brett Taylor. Yeah, he was uh, it worked at google on maps then left and did Fred feed, which is awesome
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:15.900]   Uh went to facebook, right?
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.940]   Yep, or let you know uh with cto facebook retired
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.820]   And uh his new startup is quip which seems to me completely dumb, but that's just me
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:28.780]   You just said nice things about him. Yep, hold the rug out
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:33.580]   Well, I do think nice of him and I think one of the reasons they're getting so much press is because everybody loves Brett Taylor
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:37.820]   So the idea of this is it is a mobile first word processor
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:42.620]   I think it's interesting that we're saying this renaissance in like writing tools, right?
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:49.340]   There's like medium and quip and that you see some you're seeing some new blogging tools ghost and octopress
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:55.100]   Um, I think I think the point is like that writing is still too hard and in a mobile first world
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:00.380]   I'm I actually haven't tried quip so i'm not i'm not sure but this morning on on in beta which my show on five by five
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:05.020]   I interviewed the founder of uh of draft draft in dot com love draft
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:11.020]   Really cool. Uh markdown based we're pro you know word price shouldn't call it a word processing app
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.420]   It's it's it's it's a it's a really beautiful compose
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:18.300]   Experience a really easy way to write and it gives you github like pull requests
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.900]   So you can collaborate so if I write a draft I can send it to you leo and say hey
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:27.020]   What do you think and then you can make some changes and send a pull request to me and then I could accept changes one by one
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:29.100]   It's way better than microsoft words
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:34.620]   Track changes and it exports to dropbox and it you know it supports markdown just a really modern web app
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:39.260]   And it made me realize like yeah, you know this whole writing thing hasn't been solved yet
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.460]   Um, so I don't know maybe there's something to to to quip
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:48.140]   It's a free app. I pat only right now, although they say they're gonna go to other places. I guess
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:52.140]   Um, there's a preview for android. That's the they say is not done
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:56.380]   But you can download it is in the play store. You can download it, but they say straight up it is not done
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.940]   According to the pc magazine review it can't print
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:06.940]   Can't save your documents doesn't let users upload files or change the font size and lacks basic word processor features
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.100]   But it it does collaborate
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:19.500]   Keep can work offline. I don't know I'll download it. I'll let you know. I mean I just I don't I don't have any use for it
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:22.540]   Um, I mean the use case was let's all work on a document together
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:26.380]   Um, you could do that in google docs pretty darn well. Um
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:32.060]   I'm pretty but you could do it. Yeah mobile first is a little weird because you don't have keyboards and so
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:35.340]   It's not the first place I'd want to create a word processing document
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.780]   No fair. I'm I'm sure Brett scratching his own itch
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.620]   Um, but I'm just not that itchy so
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:46.860]   You're more scratchy
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.740]   So I don't really
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:52.300]   And just not that it's so title
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:57.900]   I know I don't really know what it's for you know occasionally we'll work on press releases right there's some
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:01.900]   Collaboration involved, but the collaboration tools that exist now are pretty good on desktop
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.300]   You can write it up in microsoft office for instance and then have the revisions back and forth
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:12.220]   Um, there's excellent like uh really good sub ether edit for instance on the mac which allows us to work
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:15.260]   Simultaneously google docs does that now?
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:20.780]   Um, so in on the desktop this this is well solved old time old school
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:26.140]   Um, and you're he's right. It's not on mobile, but there's a reason it who wants to create documents on mobile
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:31.580]   Right, right. Maybe this is about reading documents because it's kind of like responsive design
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.820]   But for documents that are not necessarily web pages
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:38.780]   So the documents look nice no matter what the screen size and these are documents that are not meant for printing
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:44.540]   They're meant for sharing creating on the screen. Yeah, they show to do lists as an example. I guess
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.700]   Yeah, I
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:54.140]   Don't really I don't really get it either. Yeah try it out though. Yeah. Well, see that's Brett
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:56.700]   People love Brett
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:59.260]   I love Brett. I love friend feed was the best thing ever happened
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:05.260]   uh, and I you know and so uh, of course it was a flop but um
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:10.780]   Sad that's the nerds loved it. Didn't you did you like it? Were you on build it up?
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:15.180]   He chairs you down. He builds you up. He chairs you down. Yeah, anyway, I I wish Brett
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.820]   Lock i'm sure he doesn't need any money
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:21.180]   Um, but uh, they've raised quite a bit of money for this
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.460]   So i'm sure it's going to be very big
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:29.260]   So the amount raised never never reflects on the product. Yeah, look at color
[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:31.180]   Wow
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:33.740]   41 million dollars and they never really did anything
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:38.460]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back uh tool tip number of the week
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.940]   But first a word from our good friends

[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:59.100]   Dot com we thank them for their sport of this week and google ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:04.460]   I give you jina trapani of smarter where dot org for her tip of the week
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:11.180]   All right, this is how to uh activate google voice search with the keyboard shortcut
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:17.100]   So if you go to google.com, there's that little microphone in the far right of the of the search box
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:24.060]   If you uh do the the keyboard shortcut which control shift period like the you know the dot period
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:29.020]   The the microphone will pop right up so you can start speaking speaking your search
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:34.700]   I always thought speaking your search was maybe a little weird, but you know, I spent all quite a bit of time as you can see on this show
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:39.580]   Talking to my computer. Uh, so it's kind of useful. So yeah, I had no idea about this keyboard shortcut
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:45.020]   I don't think it's new. I think it's just new to me, but control control shift period on on windows or command shift period for mac
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:48.940]   Uh, we'll bring up the uh, the big old red microphone
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:51.980]   You can start asking google what you want from the google google home page
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:57.660]   My favorite part of that was the jina felt compelled to translate the word period, you know the dot the dot
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.340]   That one
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.340]   You know what they call it dot
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:05.740]   I did that earlier when I cut people out there. It's what we used to call period
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:14.140]   I only I call I call all exclamation marks bangs now. Yeah bangs. Yeah. Well hash bang
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:20.700]   I had a british editor working for me at entertainment weekly and I and I probably didn't see I can't say this on this part of the show
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:23.340]   She called it a uh a dog's
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:26.140]   Let words starts with a c which means oh
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:31.980]   That's what they evidently called on on Fleet Street. I'm gonna call it that from now on
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:35.580]   They had too many dog members in this sentence
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:41.740]   The the bang okay. Yeah, I guess I could see that I find that hard to stomach
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:49.500]   Things you can't don't see I love the britishisms, you know, you think british people are very cultured very, you know
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.700]   Refined and then you hear them swear
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:56.380]   It's true
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:00.940]   My biggest eye opener. What was that great movie? Uh in the loop. Have you seen that?
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:04.220]   No, it's on nefflix watch it hysterical
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:09.340]   uh, it's about the british government member uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, minister
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:16.860]   and um, and just it's the funniest movie ever came out in 2009 and uh,
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:20.380]   the one of the main characters in there is uh,
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:25.260]   Assistant to the prime minister who swears a blue streak that is just
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:29.020]   Unbelievable dogs member is the least of it
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:34.060]   And yes, james gandalfini is in that he plays in that movie plays a general
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:41.500]   Uh, he's wonderful in it is it's it's a very very good show. It's apparently based on a british tv show called the sick of it
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:45.500]   Oh, which is very funny. You can prime minister fancy a war
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.340]   Yeah, come in
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:48.140]   Yeah
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:53.740]   It is so funny and it's such a send up of you should look up the series leo that the sera you would love the series that it's great
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:59.340]   And I think that uh, veep which was the hbo series with julio lewy dreyfus was based on all of that
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:05.900]   Loosely but it's not loosely not nearly as as but some but they're trying to get the verbal uh stuff together. Yeah
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:08.860]   Good. All right. There you go a movie tip as well
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:15.260]   Jeff, what's your number of the week? Uh, I decided for this. So my number of the week is 1803
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:19.660]   print is dead at 1803 the onion
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:22.780]   And the reason i'm showing this to you beside
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:27.180]   I'm
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:31.180]   Not only that is holding up a newspaper ladies and gentlemen
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.860]   So so i'm quite
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:38.460]   It did not go gentle to that good night though. Jarvis continued it was tough tough as nails to the very end
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.620]   so i'm
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:42.860]   quoted you're in the obituary for print
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:46.780]   I went on google plus and I and I put up I said well actually they could have really quoted me
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:48.860]   Here's what I said about it in in german with the geek
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:52.940]   Uh, so my friend shawn said this to me you can't get these new york now you get them in madison
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:55.660]   But here's the funny part about it is that was a trick to
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:59.660]   Tell madison that they're going to stop printing the paper. Wow. It really is dead
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:03.180]   So when I when I saw this I said oh the irony of ironies of course
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.140]   I have to have this in print and so i'm going to frame this in my office
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.780]   I I have in my office. Let me see if I can do this here
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:14.300]   The last edition of chicago dinner day the paper that had don't tomorrow that I used to work on
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.620]   And I have in my office over there the last edition of the of the
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:21.100]   Chicago daily daily news
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:25.260]   So now I have the last edition of the madison onion and i'm very procticoity
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.740]   It's a paper cemetery or office
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:36.140]   I don't think I think a lot of us who read the onion online and uh who saw an onion video and so forth didn't know it was a print paper
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:42.380]   I I was kind of surprised when I first saw it in print. Yeah, I guess it was it was used to be all around New York
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:47.660]   I guess not in New York madison what is austin a few places they explained that they actually
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:54.380]   Jobbed out the printing and ad sales in markets to other companies and some are profitable in some work
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.620]   But I think that's they're basically all going to become unprofitable
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:01.180]   That's kind of so so madison's dead, but not the other print
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:05.900]   Uh, well, New York's dead. I think I think they're one by one. They're just it started in madison
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.460]   So I think if they're killing madison probably killing it all
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.180]   1803
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:15.420]   One i'm sorry 1,803 years old. Yeah. Yeah
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:21.420]   I love so they in other words they you are so well known as a critic critic critic of print
[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:24.860]   That they they didn't ask you for quote. They just made up a quote
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:30.620]   Were you happy with it? It was pretty it was pretty great drove goes really well done. I thought it was a good job
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:33.740]   It shows how well known you are jeff that's really awesome
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:42.780]   So here's the lead new york sources close to print the method of applying ink to paper in order to convey information to a mass audience have confirmed that the declining medium passed away
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:45.020]   early thursday morning
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.020]   It's a communication was
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.740]   1,803 years old
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.740]   Aww
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:55.340]   That's hysterical if it weren't so true. Yeah
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:40:01.420]   Uh, my my uh tool is something that's not out yet, but jin and i were talking about this
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:07.260]   Uh kush the well-known very famous creator of clockwork moddy's a great android developer
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.580]   I guess you were talking about this yesterday
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:14.380]   Um is creating a mobile to uh chromecast app
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:18.860]   It's not out yet. You can't download it yet. Unfortunately this video seems to have uh
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:23.340]   Frozen let me see if I can refresh the youtube yes, he created an android share intent
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:28.940]   Well, so if you have stuff if you have i love it by the way that his video starts with two dirty socks
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.820]   He doesn't you know, he's not big on production value
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:36.860]   But the idea is if you have content movie
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:41.180]   video that you shot a picture on your uh phone
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:44.140]   That you could just then send it to
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:48.860]   This is a demo of my chromecast app that I wrote by the way notice
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:52.540]   He's got it on the choice of phone excellent
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:56.940]   And that's a google edition version or he's running uh, he's probably running cyanogen
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:00.620]   Basically, it lets me take a video or a picture and fling it straight to my tv
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:04.380]   So I will um start recording right now
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:11.740]   Uh-huh uh-huh there's a dog and we can wash my dog for a bit maybe get a little better angle here
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:18.060]   Not exactly riveting dog video riveting dog video
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:24.380]   Pop test is bedtime so that should be enough. Yes, that's more than enough. Thank you kush
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:28.780]   Um
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:32.060]   Now this is what's cool. I'll select it and then right up here. There's a
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:37.580]   Shared a chromecast so it would just be a so you could install it and it would become a share
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:40.220]   Yeah, it's a share item. So if I click it
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:44.220]   Instead of having a chromecast button on the app
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:49.180]   Right anything that could you know reasonably look at that talk about
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:56.380]   Instant uh satisfaction as you can see this was the the video I just took is that great?
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.380]   Happening here
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:02.940]   So knowing kush it will be free and available quickly he does have some paid stuff, but uh
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:06.940]   Like you can pay for clockwork mod, which I do and I encourage you to do
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:08.700]   um
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:15.260]   I mean, you know, if you have auto backup or instant upload enabled your videos are going into youtube anyway on google plus
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.780]   That's true
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:19.980]   So, but you know that this takes a lot more. This is like instant, you know, writes the tv
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.020]   So I like that a lot
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.420]   I just I like that he demonstrated that you could do it
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.100]   In fact he got into a little twitter fight with groover
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:29.100]   He was like, uh groover said that you couldn't do this, but yes you can here's me doing it
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:34.700]   john really showed his uh his apple fanaticism when his his reaction to the chromecast was so lukewarm
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:37.180]   So tap it on like a big deal
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:43.020]   Yeah, yeah, it's yeah, okay. Yeah, he's yeah, he's too. He's staying that ecosystem john. You you enjoy it
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:50.460]   Yeah, if you want a better dog video now, have you seen the dog video of the guy who returns home after six months?
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:57.180]   Yeah, oh wait. Oh, I just clicked on it. Oh, i'm watching an ad just put i'll put it up
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.900]   Put the link in there because i'll uh, i'll play with the link in there
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:03.820]   We can there's also a version for a cat which we'll get to in a second. Yeah, the cat one was great
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:07.260]   i've seen the cat one. I haven't seen the dog one. I didn't realize it was a response
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:12.300]   I love the cat one
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:17.740]   The cat as you might imagine is doesn't he's nonetheless. Yeah, whatever. Here's the dog
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:19.500]   Uh
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:23.580]   After being gone over six months is what happened when my puppy saw her daddy again
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:31.820]   He's coming up the stairs. I guess where was he traveling or was he in the army or are we
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:41.500]   Oh, he's happy. That's a happy dog. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was in the military. Yeah.
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:47.420]   Oh, isn't that nice? That's a happy dog
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:52.220]   The tail

[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:06.460]   That's so good. He just won't give
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:14.300]   That makes nippings Tuesday way. Do you miss daddy?
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:22.700]   I don't think i's gonna do that for me
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:24.700]   Oh
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:34.700]   Right
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:42.300]   Anybody who thinks dogs don't know what's going on
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:48.780]   Now we gotta find the cat one
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:55.420]   All right, let me see if I can find that is this this goes on, but I I presume it's much like much the same
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:58.380]   Okay, it's not the end
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:00.460]   By a long shot
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.780]   cat welcomes home
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:08.540]   Soldier, let's see if we can find uh cat sees owner after six-month leave. Oh, okay cat
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:15.420]   Yeah, yeah, because there's actually some with the cat actually welcoming the soldier cat sees owner after
