[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.100]   He's off to Norway this week actually.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.900]   For Twit photo, they're at the Nordic Lite Festival.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.000]   Is that right?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.200]   So I get to fill in again on this week in Google.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.300]   I'm very excited to be here of course with Gina Trapani from SmartAware.org.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.500]   Welcome, Gina.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.700]   Great to be here.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.300]   Great to be here as well with Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMashin.com.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.100]   Hey, all.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.100]   And I actually know the truth, you stuffed Leo.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.900]   Well, that seems to be the rumor.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.200]   Leo, we'll be back next week.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   I promise.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.100]   But we have a great guest with us from this week in law.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.600]   Denise, how?
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   Hi, everyone.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.800]   How's it going, Denise?
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.600]   It's going great.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.100]   It's thanks for joining us and helping our audience get through their long Leo list weeks.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   Yes, it can make things very tedious, I'm sure.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.700]   I know.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.900]   I'm so sorry, everyone.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.400]   But we got some good Google News to get through today.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   The big thing was the unicorn made real Google Drive showed up yesterday.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.500]   Everybody got it?
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.600]   Yep.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.200]   No.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.100]   No.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   Denise?
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.100]   No, don't have it.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.900]   But anxious to hear Gina's take.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.900]   I got mine this morning, actually.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400]   I didn't have it and I was being all grumpy about it.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.800]   And then the email showed up this morning.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.900]   So I can give you hope at least.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.500]   Good.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.400]   It does eventually show up.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.500]   It does exist.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.700]   So you played around with it a lot, Gina?
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.700]   I have.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.900]   I installed the client on my Mac and on my Android phone.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.900]   And I really, I like it a lot.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.300]   You know, I mean, I have this model in my head for how these apps should go.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.900]   And truthfully, my idea of how these apps should be is kind of modeled on Dropbox
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900]   because that's what I've been using for a long time.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.500]   What's interesting about Google Drive is that it converts Google Docs into Google Drive.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.900]   So once you opt into it, you don't have Docs anymore in the black bar.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.200]   It just says drive.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.300]   And when you sync your documents, you get all the spreadsheets and drawings and docs.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.900]   You've created in Google Docs on your desktop.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.400]   But what's what's weird about it, what surprised me about it is that you get links to those docs.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.800]   Like if you click on the doc, it doesn't launch Microsoft Word to open a doc file.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.500]   It launches your browser to edit it online in Google Docs.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.900]   So that was a little surprising.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.900]   But you know, you can store regular files in Google Docs.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.900]   You've been able to do this for a while.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.800]   So you can upload a move file or a PNG file and those sync and those open locally.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.300]   The way the same way they do on the products that do the same thing.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.500]   We understand that, Gina.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.100]   What's that?
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.600]   Okay.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.800]   Just talk in one second.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.700]   So if I have a Microsoft Word doc that I've saved to this folder, right?
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.800]   And I open it up.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.100]   It does not open Microsoft Word.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.300]   You said it opens it up in.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.400]   No.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.300]   No.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.500]   No.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.800]   If you create a Microsoft Word document and save it as a dot doc into your Google Drive,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.500]   it syncs as a file and it opens with Microsoft Word.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:28.400]   If you create a doc in Google Docs, it actually gets this special extension called dot dot dot G doc.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.600]   And the spreadsheets are dot G sheet.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.100]   And there's dot G draw.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.200]   All the dot G something files are actually just are links to open up inside the browser.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.800]   So you edit them.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.700]   I edit them in the cloud.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.100]   So I've got it.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.700]   I've got one syncing on my machine here and you can see you get these little googly icons for all the
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.600]   Google stuff.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.400]   But then down here, I've got an actual doc and you get it's kind of really hard to see on this.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.100]   But you get a more typical Word doc icon.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.200]   So you can visually tell the difference between them.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.100]   Exactly.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.600]   Exactly.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.400]   So at first, I think this confused a lot of people.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.700]   It was like, well, then what's the point?
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.600]   If it's just a link, you know, what what do I need this for?
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.200]   I was happy about it because I saw a lot of docs that I haven't looked at in years and years.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.300]   I didn't realize I'd even been using docs that long and you can sync other kinds of other kinds of documents.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.800]   I never organized my Google Docs.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.300]   I never made folders and organize them.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.000]   So it was just kind of, you know, when I installed Google Drive, I got this folder just.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.400]   It was this pile of unorganized, you know, it's just big mess of links to Google Docs that I had saved.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.500]   But you can you can organize them in folders and I'll sync back to to you.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.700]   Well, it's not Google Docs anymore.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   It's just drive Google Drive.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.500]   It's if you look at the interface looks exactly like the old Google Docs interface, except it says drive.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.900]   Open the upper left corner and you got a few different options if you drill down into it.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.800]   But otherwise you wouldn't even notice.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.300]   Right.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.100]   It looks similar.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.700]   Although there are a couple of little changes.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.400]   If you look on the upper right hand corner, you can view a list or by grid.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.600]   So next there's to the right of sort.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   Yeah, like there's like that grid view, which you'll be able to preview images.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.000]   You can see previews of documents, which is interesting.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.400]   And the search has improved a lot.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.500]   So if you look up at the search box, I stopped using the search a long time ago.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.700]   If you click on that down arrow on the far right of the search box, you can search by file type.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.900]   Right.
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.500]   So so one cool thing that Google Drive does, it does OCR and images.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.700]   Right.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:28.800]   If you snap a picture of a poster or whiteboard and you save the image to Google Drive, you can it will recognize the text or will try to recognize text.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:36.100]   So in the search box, you can say, show me all the images, which have the word, you know, cat in them and it'll and it'll will show you that.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.200]   So that's pretty useful.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.800]   I don't have any images.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.600]   You don't have any images.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.500]   Well, PDFs presentations.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.300]   Show me all the PDFs that have the word cat in them.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.300]   Actually, how many spreadsheets have the word cat in them?
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.100]   There is one.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.600]   Look at that.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.200]   Right.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.600]   There you go.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.800]   Cats.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   I mean, you need not me out.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.600]   All the cats at me.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.300]   How are you feeling?
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:08.300]   You know, one thing I like about this too is that you get my drive, which shows you, you know, your folders and your docs separate from shared with me.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   That declutters it quite a bit because some people share stuff with me that I just need to glance at, but then it constantly is bubbling up to the top.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.800]   Now you do have to when you sort it sorts by either share date or headline.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   So you have to go in and change that.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.900]   I can't remember now where you change that, but you can change that to sort by activity instead.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.700]   Oh, it's it's over the left.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.800]   There's a selection for shared with me where you click activity and then it'll show you based on like, oh, what was the latest one updated.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.700]   Right.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:55.900]   Now, I'm sorry to be remedial here as usual, but you put a folder on your desktop as you do with Dropbox is it is it operate like drop Dropbox in terms of just moving something over.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   It's a desktop.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.200]   Can I have more than one folder that is synced or I have to do folders within that folder.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:14.300]   It when you install the client, are you desktop, say on your Mac, it creates a folder called Google Drive and you authenticate with one Google account and that represents your drive.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:14.700]   Right.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.700]   So everything in that folder is exactly what's on the website, you know, the web app.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.500]   Right.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.900]   So so if you create a sub folder within it, it creates a sub folder, you know, inside drive.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.300]   If you organize files, if you edit files, that kind of thing, it all gets reflected.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.600]   So it's just like Dropbox, you know, you install Dropbox.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.100]   All right.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:38.600]   Here's my next, my next one, which is my, my chronic, yes, but to all things Google these days, I have two Gmail accounts.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.100]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.500]   Can I have two instances of drive?
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.400]   Not that I can see it's a single user.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.100]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.100]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.700]   I know.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.400]   I mean, you can sign up for sake in us.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.200]   It's funny.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.300]   You mentioned that because one of the things is if you type in docs.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.000]   Google.com, it's supposed to redirect to Google Drive because that's docs.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:07.800]   What I found funny, I put in docs.google.com and it redirected to wait for it.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   Well, maybe it'll redirect now it won't because I want to do it live.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.300]   But oh, yeah, there it goes.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:22.000]   It redirected to my sword and laser Google apps on the domain account instead, which is not a Google drive account.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.600]   Google Google.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.900]   You got to fix this.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.800]   I'm curious why why that happens.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   That's I have.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.800]   I have shared documents under both Gmail accounts.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   So does that mean I can't have drive?
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.100]   Do I even have the option of not having drive?
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.100]   Do I can I still keep docs?
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.800]   Oh, sure.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.600]   Well, you don't have to install the software.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.600]   You can just use it on the web.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.900]   Yeah, you can just use it on the web.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.300]   I can only do it for one account.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:56.700]   Well, you can in the desktop client, you can log out from your current Google account and log in with another, but I think that it would have to it would rethink everything again.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.000]   I actually haven't tried that.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.500]   That's over.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.800]   Well, this is what we've all made.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.900]   Then that's going to confuse every other thing I have open and it's going to sign me out of what it does is it signs me out of everything.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:17.200]   And then I have to find the secret wizards handle with my left foot raised to get the right order to exactly restart everything.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.100]   And so my one Gmail, my other Gmail, my Google Plus is this account, but my docs, is that account?
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.900]   Yeah, the multi-account issue is an issue for sure.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:38.300]   We're going to have a similar issue, I guess, in our household because my son and I frequently share a computer and he has his own Google account and I have my own and he uses docs for school and I use it for work.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.200]   And so I can see where this would be a bit.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.400]   A young man, why are you somebody to brief for this essay?
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.900]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:52.300]   Do you switch user accounts on the computer itself or did you log in on the computer?
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.900]   Just to make it clean.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.100]   We usually use a different browser.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.600]   Okay.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.100]   Okay.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.800]   So you know, if I logged in in one browser, I won't be in the other.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.600]   Right.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   Right.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.100]   Right.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.400]   Right.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   Right.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.100]   I think it's on a per user basis.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:18.600]   So if I'm logged in as me and my computer that Google Drive folder is within my user folder, but if I log out and my wife logs in or someone else, my family logs in, they can have a separate sinking folder.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.100]   I think it's only if you're sharing the same computer user or where it might be an issue.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:33.600]   Do you, but do you, do you log in from the Google Drive app or do you, like if I log out of my web browser, it doesn't log me out of the app.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.800]   It doesn't change the Google Drive folder on my desktop.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   Right.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.300]   That's right.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.300]   Okay.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.900]   That's right.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.400]   All right.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.900]   Wow.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.400]   I'm only using .01 gigabytes.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.000]   I figured I would add more in there.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:52.900]   You know, is there, is there any indication that now that Google has this in place, there are other things, obviously, that we're storing to the cloud with Google, other devices.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.700]   Other than our documents, you know, it has its music piece.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.900]   It has Picasa.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.800]   Is there any indication these are going to be put together?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   I mean, it seems like the next logical step, right?
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.100]   That Picasa, that photos and music would tie into this eventually.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.000]   And I'm not kind of actually kind of surprised that, that they're not right now.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.100]   I mean, it took a really long time for drive to launch.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.500]   And it's a solid one.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   Oh, launch, but it's, it doesn't have any.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.700]   I thought there was going to be some crazy magic multi Google product sauce that they couldn't launch until after the privacy policy.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.500]   Thing had been worked out or something.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:36.300]   And we know we're not obviously not seeing that in this version, but it seems that make the most logical sense that music and Picasa would, uh, would follow suit and get integrated with drive pretty soon.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.100]   What else do you think they could do now that they have our Docs were a desktop?
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:49.700]   Well, I mean, one point to make is that the storage fees are now the same across all the platforms.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:55.700]   So people who were using Picasa now have to pay more for storage, even if they still just want to use Picasa.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.700]   So I think that indicates they will eventually unify all this stuff.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.700]   But more to your question, Jeff.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:07.700]   Uh, one of the things they're doing is putting in apps that are tied into Google drive.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.700]   Uh, cause Sundar Pichai is the guy who killed G drive when he came to Google a few years ago.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.700]   And I read an interview on all things D today where they're like, well, now what changed your mind.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.700]   He said the reason we killed G drive is cause it was about files.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.700]   And we said, look, Google Docs is a better solution for this.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.700]   So we went and we rebuilt it around Google Docs.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:34.700]   And one of the, one of the things we want to do is get rid of this idea of files and get rid of, and get to the idea of use cases and what people do with their data.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.700]   And so they've, they've, uh, they've added all of these apps and they plan to add more, uh, add more.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:48.700]   Uh, hello facts, we video, uh, balsamic, which allows you, I designers to collaborate, the collaboratively create wireframes.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:54.700]   Uh, Lulu, the, the book on demand publisher where you can self publish actually is, uh, has gotten an app.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.700]   We video the, the online video editing program.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.700]   Yes.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   That's, that's there as well.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.700]   Yes.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.700]   So it's like you use all these disparate, disparate web apps, but the place where you store your data for them is Google.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.700]   Right.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.700]   So it's like, it's like all of your web activity or all the files that you create across the web.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   If you're editing documents or making wireframes or plus publishing a book or editing video, it all just is in your Google account, but you can use all these different apps around the web, aviary and we video and.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:29.700]   So those chrome apps are those, the old, all the old Chrome apps are, are the same thing or is this another bifurcane.
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   When you, when you install these apps, you install, install them as a Chrome app and there's a little icon that says works with Google Drive.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.700]   So one of my favorite ones, MindMeister is a mind mapping app.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.700]   It's a, it's really good mind mapping app.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.700]   I've actually really liked it.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.700]   I've reviewed our life hacker years ago and so you can install MindMeister into Chrome.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.700]   So it installs the little shortcut in your, your new tab page in Chrome.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.700]   And then you, when you launch it, it says, Hey, can I off you on Google Drive?
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.700]   Can I store files in Google Drive?
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.700]   And you say yes.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   And then when you create maps, they all just get stored in Google Drive, which is really nice because if you, you know, if you share a folder with your Google Drive, you can use it.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:14.700]   You share a folder with your team, for example, and you want to store the mind maps, the wireframes, the images, the videos, all in one place and just share that one folder to everyone.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.700]   And, you know, that's, that's really useful.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.700]   So you don't have to say, Hey, log in to this app here, log in to that app here to get this or that.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.700]   Does this give new life to Chrome as an OS?
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:32.700]   Well, that's an interesting thought because they are talking about the fact that Google Drive will be the file management system for Chrome OS in the next version.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:40.700]   There's a, there's a beta version of it being used in the current version, but the next rev, I can't remember, is a 12 or 13 that I off the top of my head, I can't remember.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:46.700]   But they, they are going to say that's going to be your file management file management can be kind of tricky and Chrome OS up till now.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.700]   Now this will be how you manage files.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.700]   All right.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   Next question.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:16:00.700]   Google read our email and added all kinds of value to that to prioritize things for us and get rid of, of people we don't pay attention to and all these wonderful things.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.700]   It can be a new excuse for not answering your email.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:11.700]   When, when we get into habit of, of storing all of our documents in this device, if that comes, what else?
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.700]   I can back to my other question.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.700]   What else could Google do with that knowledge?
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.700]   Steal your content.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.700]   I know that's not what they want with it.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.700]   That's not where you're going with that.
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.700]   Oh, willy nilly.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.700]   It'll be terrible.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.700]   Well, and I'm not directly answering your question, Jeff, because I do.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:44.700]   For example, couldn't they, couldn't they yet improve Gmail even more knowing which documents we actually manipulate, who we send them to, what's in them, what things we save, what we do with them.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:54.700]   I mean, I always argue that Google is looking for more signals, signal generation, and having all of our docs and having the permission, we'll discuss this in a minute.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:01.700]   To do things to them, like translate them or whatever, gives them knowledge about us that they can use in other ways.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:07.700]   The one will free people out is when you find an ad on your Microsoft Word document, but that would happen.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.700]   I don't think.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:16.700]   But, but, you know, does this potentially overnight even improve Gmail?
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   I mean, it could, right?
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   And this is kind of what wave, like the vision of wave, not to bring up wave along the part of Google wave, was to put communication and collaboration all in one place, right?
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.700]   So to be able to chat and email back and forth, but also co-edit a document.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.700]   And this doesn't in a way that's a lot clearer, right?
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:47.700]   We know that we edit docs and we know that we send emails, but now that Google, you know, with the new privacy policy, can share that information across the products that they can make it easier to collaborate to talk to one another about a doc as you write it.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.700]   And you know, things like --
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.700]   >> So, do you know what the wave dude, this isn't doing?
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:58.700]   >> Well, I mean, wave had kind of the real time as you type technology.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.700]   It was a completely different place that you went, though.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.700]   It wasn't your email inbox and it wasn't Google Docs, so that was kind of confusing.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.700]   >> The hall of notes have it.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.700]   >> What's that?
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.700]   >> Hall of notes have it.
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.700]   >> Yeah, well, you're talking about the video, the ad with hall of notes for --
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.700]   >> But I interrupted for a cheap joke.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.700]   Go ahead.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.700]   >> You know, wave is really geeky.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   It had this very full featured API where you could create widgets like polls and maps and you could collaborate on things inside of Wave, but they're all really wonky and no one who had to get them.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   >> You could just get there.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:36.700]   >> Well, this is -- I mean, this is what's happening with Drive being able to connect to other web apps.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.700]   I mean, this is a way to be extensible.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.700]   I think that's just a lot more sustainable.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.700]   And people just have a model of what this means a little bit better.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.700]   You know, like, I'm going to use this mind-napping app and it's just going to save the document back to Google Drive.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.700]   I think that makes a lot more sense.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:56.700]   >> And it's available across -- if you're using -- if you're living in the Google universe, it's available across everything, right?
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.700]   So I don't have to save it to my desktop, edit it, and then put it back into Gmail.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:09.700]   I can actually just continue to work on whatever it is and go to Gmail and mail it off or mail a link to collaborate or edit that YouTube video.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.700]   I mean, it just -- it gets rid of the barriers, but it also --
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.700]   >> So it's uploading, downloading --
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.700]   >> It also puts huge barriers around you on the outside.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:26.700]   So there's no more barriers on the inside, but it makes it so you don't want to go out and use Yahoo mail, for instance, because that's not going to have the same integration.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.700]   >> Right. Yeah.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.700]   To someone who wants to open your file, they have to sign in with their Google account.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.700]   They have to also have their Google account to do so.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.700]   >> So if you're in Redmond, what are you thinking today?
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.700]   >> You're thinking SkyDrive is better.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.700]   >> SkyDrive has 7 gigabytes free.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.700]   >> You're possibly thinking Antitrust.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.700]   >> Are you?
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.700]   Are you thinking Antitrust?
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.700]   >> I don't know.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.700]   >> Microsoft's always thinking Antitrust.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.700]   >> I think, yes, that might --
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.700]   >> One slide or the other.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:57.700]   >> -- the more that Google tries its products together, the more it starts to resemble what Microsoft went through.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.700]   >> Well, that's a good question, right?
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:06.700]   SkyDrive, is it integrated with Hotmail in the same way that Gmail is now integrated with Google Drive?
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.700]   I don't think --
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.700]   >> I have no idea.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.700]   >> I don't think it's Hotmail in years.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.700]   >> I think Hotmail --
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.700]   >> Chatroom, anybody use Hotmail?
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.700]   >> I think Office Live.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.700]   >> Go ahead, admit it.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:23.700]   >> Well, I tell you what is true is that Office Live is not integrated with SkyDrive the same way that Google Drive is integrated with Google Docs.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:31.700]   So they've at least got one thing to point to say like, "Okay, well, we're not forcing you into this situation."
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.700]   But I think they'd like to force you into that situation.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.700]   >> It said that Google still has ways to go to get to Microsoft Word compatibility.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.700]   >> That's very true.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:53.700]   I use Google Docs to create Word documents because I don't care about making them very fancy, but there are all kinds of things I can do in Word that I can't, which is one of the reasons I was surprised to see Lulu as a self-publisher have an app.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:03.700]   I assume that means that they have a template that works in Google Docs, but I have published two books on Lulu, and both of them I had to format in either open or open or open or open or open.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:10.700]   So I think that's why you need the app, is the app allows you to make those further tweaks.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:20.700]   >> I think because we video thing is a big deal since I teach in a journalism school, every student here has to get free use of Final Cut.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.700]   And it's less expensive than it was, but I think we move more and more away from those things.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.700]   From Word and Final Cut and all that.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.700]   And I'm thinking that you could teach journalism students going forward with a Chromebook.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.700]   You could edit photos, you could edit video, you can create graphics.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.700]   You could, unfortunately, you can't get the lights to stay on.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.700]   Sorry.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.700]   >> There you go.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.700]   >> I'm alive.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.700]   >> Is this because you're so calm?
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.700]   You're so centered and zen, the lights just forget that you're there.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:04.700]   Somebody in the chat room is pointing out that SkyDrive does have Word Docs now, so that's, that is something that they can, they can compete on.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.700]   >> Right, next question, if you're a Dropbox today, what are you thinking?
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   >> You're thinking, gosh, I wish I was integrated with something.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.700]   But otherwise, I don't know.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:20.700]   I think you're also thinking that I don't necessarily think you're interested in a computer.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.700]   I don't necessarily want to rush this into this next story.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.700]   But you're thinking, why didn't you watch the mistakes we made Google Drive with your terms of service?
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.700]   >> That's a really good point.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.700]   >> A really good point.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:43.700]   >> Before we move off to that, anything else that Dropbox versus Google Drive, I mean, it's a matter of trust, I think, really.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.700]   >> Yeah, great show.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.700]   >> Yeah?
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.700]   >> Does Dropbox have an API?
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.700]   >> Dropbox has a great API.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   I use it for the mobile apps that I built, save your file back to Dropbox.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.700]   >> SkyDrive?
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:07.700]   >> From what I understand, no, I don't support SkyDrive, although, I don't know if I should say this publicly, but Microsoft reached out to me and said,
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.700]   "Hey, will you add SkyDrive support to your app?"
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.700]   I mean, it's an open source app, and most people are using it at the command line or on Linux.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.700]   I mean, it's kind of a cultural thing.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.700]   It's like, you know, there's a little bit of a cultural clash there.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   But I know that a lot of people are going to want Google Drive support just because they probably are already using it.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.700]   I'm going to use both, right?
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:37.700]   I use Google Docs before, I'm going to use Google Docs now, I use Dropbox before, I'm just going to, you know, I also have the Google Music client running.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.700]   I mean, at this point, I don't think it's an either/or proposition.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.700]   Dropbox's API is definitely better than Google Drive's is at the moment.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:52.700]   >> All right, we've been hinting around at this terms of service situation, so we might as well get right to it.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:24:01.700]   There is some controversy amongst some that Google Drive, in their terms of service, says that when you upload or otherwise submit content to your service,
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:17.700]   you give Google and those we work with a worldwide license, license, not ownership, to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, such as those resulting from translations, adaptations, or other changes that we make so that your content works better with our services.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:23.700]   Communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute such content.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.700]   The rights you grant in the license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our services and to develop new ones.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.700]   This license continues even if you stop using our services.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.700]   I think that's one that got people's feathers ruffled.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.700]   This sounds awful, Denise, but can you translate this?
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.700]   What does this actually give Google the right to do?
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:53.700]   >> Right, so the reason, part of the reason this sounds awful is because Google tried to consolidate their terms and make them apply across their various services.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:25:09.700]   So when you're thinking of some of these things, modify, publicly perform, etc., they don't really have a whole lot of application to things that you might do with a docs kind of format.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:17.700]   So it's one of the pitfalls of trying to make things apply to each and every service.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.700]   There are going to be some things unique to each service that maybe deserve their own terms.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.700]   It's just a downside to taking that approach.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   The other thing that is important, and I wrote about this when Google+ came out and people were worried about uploading their photos and using the Picasa aspect of that, is that Google does do what a lot of other companies don't and say, yes, you're going to grant us a license so that we can effectively
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.700]   give you access to and make our services work well with your stuff.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:26:00.700]   But we're going to limit that license to operating and promoting and improving our services.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:13.700]   Now, I have no idea why Google feels compelled to throw promote in there because the last thing anybody wants is for their private photo or their private document to show up in some promotion of Google's services.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.700]   And I think Google's probably well aware of that.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:26.700]   Well, wouldn't that be that if you put something onto Google+, if you share it there and choose to share it there, they have a new share thing, you are promoting that?
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.700]   Yeah, I mean, maybe that's what they mean by promote.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:37.700]   But to the extent that we help us with our advertising strategy, I think they can toss that one right out.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:51.700]   So if you upload a public video, YouTube video of you doing a Lady Gaga cover, right? And they run a Lady Gaga commercial for Chrome, which is like a bunch of people on YouTube who have uploaded public videos like dancing to Gaga.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.700]   Can Google cut together a commercial like that without asking those people?
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.700]   Or is this given the right to do that?
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.700]   Yeah, I think they can under this language.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:10.700]   So if you've made something public like a YouTube video, in that example, you now have a new tool to make things public. And once they're public, they're public is what Google's saying.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.700]   Right, but they don't say that. I mean, this is the thing that I wish they'd said in the terms.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.700]   If you have made something, if you've made content public, I mean, this is the thing.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.700]   I don't have a problem with Google voice using my voicemails to improve their voice recognition.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.700]   I don't have a problem with Google, you know, translating email messages that I get in Italian to English for me.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.700]   I mean, they ask me, you know, when they detect another language, do you want this translator? No problem with that.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.700]   I don't have a problem with Google looking at my images and doing OCR for me and making them more searchable.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.700]   And this is all stuff that makes sense.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:43.700]   And it's all stuff that requires that they have access to my private data in order to make the service better.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:56.700]   I just, it sounds like these terms mean that if I've uploaded my super secret, you know, business model from my new company, and I've only shared it with my co-founder, that Google can publish that without my permission.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.700]   And that's what they're saying.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.700]   These terms seem to be implied.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.700]   Well, I think that's the thing.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:12.700]   Well, there's this language for the limited purpose of operating, promoting and improving our services, whatever Google and ultimately a court decides those terms mean.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:23.700]   The problem I have, Gina, and you've hit the nail right on the head is that Google has made great strides in giving people fine grained ways to share.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.700]   And to lock things down that should be locked down.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.700]   And these terms aren't acknowledging that.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:44.700]   What they say is when you upload or otherwise submit content to our services, and they don't acknowledge in their terms that there are fine variations on how that can be done and what sort of permissions and expectations are going along with each upload and submission.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.700]   And the terms should acknowledge that.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:57.700]   Is it an example of lawyers saying, well, we need to write language that gives us the right to translate Gina's document and share from YouTube to Google Docs to drive.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.700]   So let's write it in a way that's as broad as possible to make sure we're covered.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.700]   And then it looks like it's protecting rights that they don't really care about.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   Yes, I think that's exactly what's going on.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.700]   And they don't need to do that.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.700]   You know, it just leads to controversy.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.700]   Well, or the issue is earlier point.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.700]   They could also explain it better, which has been the problem we talked about this last week.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:24.700]   This was a problem with Google, I think a lot lately, is then sit down and anticipate these questions and deal with them.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.700]   And so this is why we're doing it.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.700]   Also put limits are necessary on it.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.700]   And we will never do this, this or this and say it in a way that we can go back and get them if they do.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.700]   Because.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.700]   Yeah, because Dropbox went through this already where they put the same terms of service out.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.700]   Everybody freaked out, they clarified them.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:50.700]   At least they tried to clarify them to say, look, we are only doing this so that we can provide you the service.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.700]   And they added some clarification that says we do not take ownership of anything you put in Dropbox.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.700]   You retain ownership and Google actually has that in their terms of service.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:04.700]   We need you to give us the rights so that we can do what you want us to do with your documents.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.700]   But there's also lots of really good examples.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.700]   And I guess, you know, if you're a lawyer at Google, you may look at Amazon and say, oh, well, they're not covering themselves very well.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:24.700]   But the Amazon web services at bot points out as between you and us, you or your licensors own all right title and interest in and to your content except as provided in this section eight.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:30.700]   We obtain no rights under this agreement from you or your licensors to your content, including any related intellectual property rights.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:36.700]   You consent to our use of your content to provide the service offerings to you and any end users.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.700]   Now, is that too vague?
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.700]   Because they're basically saying you keep all the rights except what we need to provide you the service.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.700]   I guess they could just redefine the service to mean anything later.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.700]   Alsler?
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.700]   Yeah, I like that approach better, certainly.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.700]   And then you get into arguing about, okay, so what is the exception in campus?
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   But better that than the default being, you know, that we're giving you everything Google.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:13.700]   And Google's terms don't say that, but, you know, my main problem with it is that they are forging ahead and doing these great things with their products to help people share things only in ways that they want to.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.700]   And yet, they're not reflecting that in their terms.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   It seems to be lazy about it.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.700]   Yeah, well, okay, you're a lawyer, you get to say that.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:29.700]   I always feel careful about calling somebody lazy when I don't understand the job they do.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.700]   But yeah, it does strike me as being sort of like, well, let's cast the net as widely as possible, and it's going to cause a lot of controversy.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:41.700]   And Google is responded by basically pointing to the clause that says, we don't keep any ownership of any of your data.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:48.700]   So I think some people are overreacting to it, but it may be sloppy is another word for the word.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.700]   For the way it was written.
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.700]   Something.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.700]   I mean, there just needs to be, you know, right hand, left hand coordination.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:02.700]   They really should say, okay, well, we've got things out there performing in this way.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.700]   Our terms should reflect it.
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:14.700]   And it seems to me like, you know, the legal department hasn't really quite sat down enough with the product department to make sure that it all meshes together well.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:21.700]   Well, I think there's another step there, which is the PR department and PR defined differently.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.700]   PR defined as truly the public's representative.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.700]   You know, and it has been suggested, I think, elsewhere.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.700]   Google doesn't need Google has a problem with this messaging.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.700]   And it has a problem with anticipating the problems that are going to come up.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:42.700]   I've long argued that they should have user committees, user advisory boards, user juries,
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.700]   ombudsman, something because it's a weakness in what they do.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.700]   We could anticipate exactly this.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.700]   You just didn't anticipate it all.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.700]   You know, you knew exactly what was going to happen.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:52.700]   Gina gave this scenario.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.700]   You knew you were going to see no surprise.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.700]   And they don't see it sometimes.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:04.700]   I think they think the world is all logical and they've got to see in these holes and they've got to anticipate them and they've got to have the answers for them.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:05.700]   And it's only in their benefit.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:11.700]   If I can jump back and forth across the fence in Google's defense, I don't think these terms changed with Google Drive.
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.700]   I think these were the same terms that Google Docs had and nobody noticed.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.700]   So if you're Google, you're like, why are you suddenly complaining now?
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.700]   It's the same terms.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.700]   But you know what's going to happen.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.700]   Of course.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.700]   You still know it.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.700]   They're not bad terms.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.700]   Gina's right.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:32.700]   They lead to impressions that may not be accurate, but you've got to deal with the impressions too.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.700]   But you also have to have a degree of trust in your right time.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.700]   I don't think they did change.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:47.700]   But maybe the increased scrutiny is because the assumption is that Drive is going to bring more users into the fold than what was existing under Docs.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.700]   Well, it's any opportunity to go after Goliath.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.700]   True.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.700]   Oh, good.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.700]   Let's find everything we can.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:04.700]   Anytime a new service comes out from anybody big like Google, people are going to start investigating it, look point poking at it, seeing if there's weaknesses.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.700]   That's good.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.700]   You want people to do that.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.700]   Yeah, it is.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:18.700]   But you know, I think to kind of zoom out, I think the truth is that when you're using free services like the ones Google provides, there has to be a level of trust.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.700]   Right.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:25.700]   I mean, if you're not paying for something, if you're not paying with money, right, you're paying how to pay.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   You can pay, but.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   Well, you can, but, but.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.700]   For the most part, I mean, you can pay in some circumstances.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:42.700]   But, but for the most part, people use free Gmail free, you know, the free and the realities that you're giving your data to get advertised to, you know, more effectively.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.700]   And if you don't trust the company that's that's providing that service, then you shouldn't use it.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:51.700]   You know, I mean, like, I, you know, we talked about the issue of trust a lot.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.700]   I trust Google enough to use their, their services.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:35:00.700]   And so it's to me, it's like, do I think Google's going to, you know, public, publish my secret documents on drive?
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.700]   No, I don't because I trust them.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   I'm pretty sure that they know that if people don't trust them, that they'll lose customers.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:14.700]   But if you read the terms of service, if you distrust Google, which I think a lot of people increasingly are to some degree, then, and this might not be acceptable to you.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.700]   But it's a question about whether or not, you know, what is acceptable to you?
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:31.700]   Just want to point out before we move off of Google Drive as a topic, the Verge has an excellent chart up comparing Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, SkyDrive, Synck, and Google Drive.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:41.700]   And it's a lot of synch, publicity, Walla, Mosey, Spider Oak, Box, SugarSync, Cubby, which is from LogMeIn, Live, Kive, and InSync.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.700]   Wow.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:50.700]   So you can just add, and in many different categories from how much storage you get for free to the file size limits, encryption, what clients are available for what platforms.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:58.700]   By the way, Google, one of the Google employees on Google Plus today pointed out that there is not a Linux client yet for Google Drive, but it's in the works.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.700]   They're working on it, and they all will say it soon, but it's definitely something they want to provide.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.700]   That's an advantage Dropbox has right now.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.700]   As Dropbox has a Linux client.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.700]   But, yeah, SkyDrive wins in storage, 7 gigabytes.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.700]   iCloud is the only one who doesn't do version tracking.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   There's some interesting stuff that kind of comes out when you look at it in this chart.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   Oh, great question.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.700]   Why didn't Amazon do this?
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.700]   You know, Amazon does have a storage locker.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.700]   Don't forget, not a consumer level, really, right?
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.700]   No, they do.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:35.700]   Yeah, it's a part of your music subscription if you buy from Amazon.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.700]   Right, but there is a general purpose, 5 gigabytes free Amazon storage.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.700]   Oh, for docs and everything?
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.700]   It doesn't have the docs.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.700]   It doesn't have version tracks.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.700]   It doesn't have a lot of these features.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.700]   It's a very basic storage.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.700]   They have AWS, and they have that storage, the vault.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.700]   It just seems like it was a baby step.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.700]   And they have the ability to read things anywhere on Kindle.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.700]   I don't know, just seems.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.700]   Yeah, well, exactly.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.700]   When you're S3 and you're powering things like Jungle Disc, which is a backup service, you
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.700]   think it'd be easy to just put one of these together.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.700]   But I guess that's the thing is it's not easy to make one of these front ends that does
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.700]   all the things that Spydero and SkyDrive and Google Drive are going to do.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.700]   Yeah, that was the big innovation, right?
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.700]   Is that it mounted this folder on your desktop and it's synced in the background.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.700]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.700]   It was all your devices and in the cloud without very passively.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.700]   Jungle Disc uses Rackspace.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.700]   I haven't just Jungle Disc in a couple of years, so then that's the switch.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   I've got three.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   All right.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:43.700]   Well, let's take a quick break and thank our sponsor, via the magic of Leo LaPoritz traveling
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.700]   through space and time.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.700]   Hey, Tom, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a little break during the show.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:53.700]   Give you all a chance to stretch your legs while I talk a little bit about go to my PC.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.700]   Now, if you're listening to the show on the treadmill, continue stretching your legs.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.700]   I'll tell you about the best remote access anywhere.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   From the folks at Citrix, they know remote access better than anybody, better than Microsoft
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.700]   licensed Citrix technology to do their remote desktop.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.700]   But we've come a long way since then and go to my PC is amazing.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   It allows you to access your Mac or your PC, Windows or Mac from anywhere.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:25.700]   You just log on to your go to my PC accounts, easy to set up, uses natural, versatile 128-bit
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.700]   SSL, so simple, so secure.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.700]   And here's the beauty part.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:36.700]   You can actually access your office computer from your iPhone, your iPad, your iPhone.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.700]   So you pull out your iPhone.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.700]   Let's say you get a call from work that says, "Ah, you forgot.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.700]   You didn't do the thing that we asked you to do.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.700]   Your TPS reports are due.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.700]   Can you hurry up?
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.700]   You're on the way to the airport.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.700]   You want to turn around?
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.700]   No problem.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.700]   You've got your iPhone.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.700]   You fire up the go to my PC app.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   And you're online using this weird to see a Windows machine or a Mac on an iPhone, but
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.700]   with that rid of display, it's actually pretty usable.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   You can send and receive email, access any network resource.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.700]   You can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.700]   You can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.700]   You can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.700]   You can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.700]   And you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   You can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.700]   So you can send and receive email to your iPhone.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.700]   Let's move on to the Google Oracle World Series of Intellectual Property.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:13.700]   And it's second week, Google's Andy Rubin was on stage in the witness stand.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.700]   Monday, let's see.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.700]   Today, actually this morning and also a little bit yesterday,
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.700]   Eric Schmidt defended Android.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.700]   And of course, this is one of the reasons we wanted to have Denise on the show.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   What's your take on where this is going?
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.700]   I mean, we talked about it quite a bit last week on this week in Google.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.700]   And you guys have talked about it on this week in law.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.700]   We spent Monday with a computer science explanation about APIs.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.700]   And then we seem to have spent the past couple days saying,
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:47.700]   in this email, are you admitting that you needed a license to Java?
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.700]   And both Andy Rubin said, no, I don't believe we do.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.700]   And Eric Schmidt said, I don't remember anything.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.700]   Right, and it's interesting that all these singers are coming out on cross-examination, too.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.700]   Google is putting on its case, its defense at this point.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.700]   So the sound bites that you've been seeing in a lot of the media coverage
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   or when David Boyes gets up and cross-examends Google's witnesses.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.700]   So he's making some headway with them.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.700]   The most critical thing at this point, I think, is this API issue, you know,
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:25.700]   what the court is going to do with that, whether they're going to determine
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:31.700]   that APIs can actually be something that are subject to copyright infringement.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   I think that has huge ramifications.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:40.700]   And, you know, in the meantime, it's just kind of Google, what do you know when?
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.700]   And Boyes, as I mentioned, is making a lot of headway with Google's witnesses.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.700]   It's interesting to me, too, that the developers that have emailed into the various shows here
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.700]   are split.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:56.700]   Some of them very vigorously, religiously say, no, APIs should not be copyrightable.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.700]   They're just addresses in the address book.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.700]   You can't copyright the phone book.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.700]   You can't copyright APIs.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.700]   Others say, no, it's not the same thing.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.700]   It takes work to create an API.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.700]   It's code that I've created.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.700]   And I know we talked about this a little last week, Cheetah,
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.700]   but having had a week of this case banging around in public,
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.700]   any additional insight into which way you think they might go with this?
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.700]   Well, Andy Ruben sent an email in '06 or something saying, hey, we should get the license for the
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.700]   Java.lang APIs.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.700]   That seemed pretty damaging, right?
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.700]   I mean, that's what the other side has been saying, that, you know, every other company has bought the
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.700]   license for these APIs.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.700]   Everybody except Google.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.700]   And then Ruben sends this email saying, hey, we should buy this license.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.700]   I mean, you know, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.700]   I'm just a developer.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:46.700]   For my point of view, and I'm a little bit of a hippie about things, everything should just be, you know, a friend.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.700]   I don't think everything should be free.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.700]   But to me, as a Java developer, these APIs seem so incredibly core to the language.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:59.700]   And because there's so little that you can do with the language without them, it seems to me that makes
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.700]   sense that they would be part, like I take Google side of it.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:07.700]   But Ruben sent this email, then he knew that it sounds as if he knew that they should have bought a license.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:12.700]   So now I think it just makes them look bad to say, oh, you know, we don't need this license.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.700]   This is just part of the line.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.700]   What kind of cost, you know, what kind of scale do you have?
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.700]   I don't have any idea how much it would have cost.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   I mean, I think we can safely say that Google could afford it.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.700]   Right?
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.700]   You're not a lawyer, Gina.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.700]   And neither is Andy Ruben.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:32.700]   You know, I think it's really interesting that the strategy in the case has been to get all these non-lawyer
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:38.700]   engineers to come out and say, you know, do delve into their emails and see, gee, you know, I guess we need a license.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.700]   They don't know whether they need a license.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.700]   It's not their job to know.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:43.700]   Right.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.700]   I mean, that's a good point.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.700]   I mean, there have been play times when I've, you know, I've sent emails and situations at companies and be like, hey,
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.700]   we need to buy whatever license we need to cover our bots with this, you know, whatever we need.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.700]   Let's get it.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:59.700]   So I mean, that could have been, that could have been, I mean, I think my Andy Ruben probably knows a whole lot more about Java than I do.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.700]   But so, yeah, this is interesting.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:06.700]   I still agree with Google that it seems APIs are a lot of work to create.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   Absolutely.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:13.700]   But these core Java.lang APIs are just, they're so, you know, they're so absolutely core to the language.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.700]   It just, I don't know.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.700]   I have a hard time thinking that there had to be, you know, another purchase.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.700]   It's really interesting to hear this conversation still, the play out though in this trial.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:28.700]   You know, even just making the explanations, you know, understandable by the way,
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.700]   you know, understandable by the, by the January and having all these kind of rock stars in tech, you know, take the stage.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.700]   Well, I think that it's one of the reasons it's getting so much attention is you're like, oh, look at that.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.700]   Larry Page is on.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.700]   And now Larry Ellison and now it's Eric Schmidt.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.700]   It's, you know, it's a cavalcade of stars.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.700]   But, but Denise to your point, I mean, a lot of what they're asking them is, you know, what did you know and when did you know it?
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:57.700]   But is that just maneuvering to try to affect the damages because it's not evidence of anything?
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:05.700]   It does have an impact on the ultimate liability issue, whether they knew that they were infringing.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.700]   And yeah, I think it's mostly on the damages side.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.700]   Like some kind of willful infringement or something like that.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:11.700]   Yes, exactly.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.700]   Okay.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:23.700]   But, you know, getting back to the API point, it's just sort of the sequel to when source code became acknowledged as something that was copyrightable,
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.700]   which wasn't always universally understood.
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:39.700]   So, you know, I think this just takes another really kind of complicated issue and something that copyright law was never designed to really encompass.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.700]   You know, we're talking about creative works.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:48.700]   We're talking about things that you can immediately identify as, you know, a work of literature, a work of music.
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:58.700]   I'm sure Gina and other developers probably feel that what they're doing is plenty creative and a lot of work and involves perhaps expression,
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:06.700]   but it's not so straightforward when you start to impose it into the framework of copyright law.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   There's also some interesting court documents that are being uncovered.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   The Verge has broken a couple of them.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.700]   This is something the judge also had indicated at the beginning of the case.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   I think he was trying to make one last ditch to get these guys to settle out of court.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:29.700]   He said, "Look, unless it's the formula for Coke, we're not going to make anything confidential."
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.700]   So what comes out in the case comes out in public and a couple of interesting things have come out.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:40.700]   One, the original Google phone was presented in 2006 and there's some mock-up presentations.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.700]   Remember, this is pre-iPhone. This is pre-anybody knowing that Apple was creating an iPhone.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:54.700]   They had a basic phone interface. They wanted the ability to integrate with, like, I think they were showing this off to T-Mobile.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.700]   But look at this thing. It's got some weird keyboard down here.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   They essentially had a basic requirement of at least two soft buttons, if not a QWERTY keyboard.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:11.700]   They made no indication of moving towards a touchscreen at all in any of this.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.700]   But does it, I don't know, looks kind of cool.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.700]   I'm not sure what that alphabet is on the keyboard down there.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:23.700]   It's fascinating to see this model now that we've moved into this full touchscreen world.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:29.700]   It's so obvious that the full QWERTY keyboard isn't always a good solution.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.700]   This thing's kind of ugly. It's got a lot of buttons.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.700]   A lot of blackberry.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.700]   Go ahead.
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.700]   No, it does look like a blackberry.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:46.700]   They said that the basic phone user interfaces and the ability to integrate as a third party are still a barrier.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.700]   And they wanted to revolutionize phone interfaces.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.700]   But they aren't the ones who actually really did that eventually.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:01.700]   The other court document that is getting some attention is Google's proposal to subsidize the data plan
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.700]   instead of subsidizing the phone.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:09.700]   In the current situation, you go and you pay less for the phone and you sign up for a two-year data plan.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   Google said, "We want to turn that on its head.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:16.700]   We want T-Mobile to sell the data plan for our phone for $9.99 a month."
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.700]   This is in 2006, mind you, to reduce the cost.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:26.700]   And the company would then forego commission it earned from T-Mobile for referring Android buyers to its online store.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:27.700]   So they thought that might balance it out.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:32.700]   Team OE, you keep the cash for all the masses we're going to send to you and you reduce the data plan.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.700]   It is brilliant.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.700]   Why don't you think it happened?
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.700]   Phone companies don't like change.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.700]   Yeah, and it's probably...
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.700]   Because I think it undercuts their pricing.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.700]   15 megabytes per month too.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.700]   That wouldn't have lasted long.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.700]   I mean, this was 2006, mind you, but still.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:56.700]   All I want is a smartphone with unlimited data and that's it.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.700]   I like, you know, you use so few of my minutes.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.700]   This would have been awesome.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.700]   But you know, if you think about it, this is really the Chromebook model, right?
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.700]   It's like, "Hey, we're going to give you the computer."
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.700]   I mean, in this case, sure it was a small phone, but a phone, you know, at this point is a computer.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.700]   We're going to give you a computer.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.700]   We're going to build in the data plan and you pay kind of a low rate just to get on the internet wherever you are.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.700]   I would have loved to see them.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.700]   Back in 2006, this would have been amazing.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.700]   I mean, even now, just getting a phone, can you get a phone unlimited data only?
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.700]   Not in states, it's not in states.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.700]   Well, from Ting, that's true.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.700]   That's true.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:29.700]   Ting and Sprint.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.700]   Sprint has an unlimited data plan.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:35.700]   Fek Sprint said today that if they get an iPhone on LTE, they will continue to offer an unlimited data plan.
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.700]   That's great.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.700]   2012.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.700]   Sprint also posted horrible losses.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.700]   Yeah, they're like, "Please, don't forget.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.700]   Stick around.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.700]   We offer phones for sale."
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:50.700]   App, by the way, speaking of Apple, they had their earnings call yesterday and there was one of the analysts
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:54.700]   asked Tim Cook in the question and answer portion of the earnings call about patent litigation.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:50:01.700]   It was a veiled question about, you know, the ongoing troubles between Android and the rest of the world.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:07.700]   Tim Cook told analysts, "He always hated litigation and I continue to hate it.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:12.700]   If we could get to some kind of arrangement where we could be assured that people invent their own stuff,
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.700]   I highly prefer to settle versus battle."
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.700]   That's a change of tune.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.700]   A little passive-wrestle.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:21.700]   Maybe, yeah.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.700]   A lot different than thermonuclear war.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.700]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.700]   That's just aggressive.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.700]   Right.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.700]   Exactly.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:34.700]   This at least is passively aggressive.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.700]   Yeah, it's, you know, he's offering a bit of a knowledge branch.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.700]   It's a backhanded olive branch, I guess.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.700]   Depends on how you look at it.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:46.700]   All right.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:51.700]   Let's move on to Google getting back into the smartphone sales game.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:57.700]   They are going to sell their, they are selling the unlocked Galaxy Nexus HSPA Plus.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:04.700]   So they did finally get a deal to sell wholesale, unlocked phone here in the United States.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.700]   $399.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.700]   Now, granted, this is not an LTE phone.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.700]   It's not a Y-Max phone.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.700]   It's HSPA Plus.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:13.700]   But that means it'll do pretty good speeds on the T-Mobile network.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.700]   You could also use it on AT&T.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.300]   It'll do pretty good speeds there as well.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.300]   And it's free and clear.
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.300]   You buy it.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.300]   It's got ice cream sandwich.
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.300]   It's the reference design.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.700]   It's going to get all the updates when Google pushes them out.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.900]   This is, this seems like what they should have done with the Nexus the first time around
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.020]   and they did that crazy store where they were promising the moon and then they ended
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.700]   up having to roll the store back.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.700]   It does.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.700]   It's better.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:38.700]   Getting much better.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.700]   What's the unlocked iPhone now is 700.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.700]   I mean, I think for the smaller.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.700]   I mean, usually you're talking 600, 700, so $399, 400 bucks.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.700]   We're getting there.
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.700]   I mean, this is the first time when it travels internationally a lot.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.700]   It becomes.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.100]   And who wants the pure ice cream sandwich, a pure Google experience, a ice cream sandwich?
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.100]   This is pretty good.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.300]   You could use this on Ting, actually.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.300]   I think.
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.300]   Can you?
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.300]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.300]   Ting is...
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:05.300]   No.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.300]   It's not GSM.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.300]   Oh, it's not GSM.
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.300]   You're right.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.300]   Okay.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.300]   I was mistaken.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.300]   Because I think the problem I'm going to bet that Ting could only do a deal with Sprint.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   Right.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   And otherwise, yeah, it's too bad they're not GSM.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   I mean, that'll all change in some ways.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.300]   Well, when Sprint finally...
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.340]   I mean, Sprint has LTE in like 60 locations.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.380]   And by locations, I mean, like 60 towers.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.180]   Most of it's in Kankakey.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.420]   But by the end of this year, they actually want to be in seven or eight big cities and
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.060]   they're going to keep rolling until 2013.
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.420]   Whether they can get there in time to keep themselves from going bankrupt is a whole
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:41.420]   different matter.
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.140]   But I really like that Google is getting behind this idea of unlocked phones.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.140]   Just you.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:51.580]   You buy the unlocked phone at a reasonable price for unlocked, for sure.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:56.060]   It's not top of the line for data connection, but it's the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.780]   So it's a good phone.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.940]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.980]   And the other interesting thing to this is it's sold through the Google Play Store in
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:07.620]   a new area called Device Says.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.620]   Bloorow.
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:12.740]   Now, are we reading too much into that?
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:17.060]   I mean, you wouldn't call it Device, I guess.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:22.100]   But everybody's looking at this as evidence that Google will be selling a tablet as Eric
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.980]   Schmidt has promised by the summer.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.980]   And glasses.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.940]   And the glasses, right?
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:27.940]   Okay.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.980]   The self-driving car might show up there someday, dude.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.980]   Yeah, the self-driving car, Chromebooks, wells.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.980]   Yes.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:37.580]   Well, in fact, Google, this is a story farther down, but Google has been shopping this self-driving
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.940]   car in Detroit.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.380]   Trying to get a partner, right?
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:42.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.940]   Google also upped their cash reward for being hacked.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.260]   This is a good thing.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:54.260]   They now will pay you up to $20,000 if you find a qualifying vulnerability.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:59.020]   The obvious deal here is they want somebody to find it and turn it into them and get the
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.220]   money so that they can patch the bug.
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.220]   $20,000?
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.220]   That's a lot of money.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.220]   That's a pretty good bounty.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.220]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   I think that's good enough to turn the blackout crackers into white-hot hackers.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.140]   They don't want to make that nice payout.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.220]   Are there enough of them that you could make a living at it?
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.220]   Ooh.
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.580]   That's an interesting question.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:22.580]   If you're...
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.580]   What is it?
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.580]   You'd have to find all of them, though.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:31.180]   In over a year, just over a year, the program has paid out $460,000 to roughly 200 individuals
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:34.820]   so it sounds like the rate of discovery is not enough to make it your sole day job.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.660]   Unless you live in a really cheap area.
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:39.500]   But you could enter into a cooperative.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.500]   Yes.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:47.060]   But if you were sharing in that pool by throwing in more brains and beating everybody else to
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:51.860]   the punch, you are winning the lottery in the sense that you're getting higher odds of
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.580]   actually getting an payout.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:57.860]   And we should point out that it's not $20,000 for every single vulnerability.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.540]   There are certain qualifying vulnerabilities that get you that much.
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:04.180]   A SQL injection is going to only bring you $10,000.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:12.820]   XSS, XSRF, other high impact flaws and sensitive applications, $3,000.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.100]   It depends on which bug you're trying to.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:19.900]   What I'm really asking is whether or not...
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:25.420]   If they're putting the software out there, couldn't you outsource even more of your debugging?
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.540]   I mean, it's great from a recruiting talent point of view, but from the point of view
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:32.540]   of the person looking for vulnerabilities, basically you have two choices.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.100]   You can join up with the bad guys and find vulnerabilities so that you can steal personal
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.340]   information and credit cards and identity theft and sense spam and all that stuff.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:45.860]   Or you can find vulnerabilities and if you make more money finding vulnerabilities or
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.740]   importing them to Google and getting money from Google and getting the opportunity to
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.100]   work with Google's internal teams and maybe even getting a job with Google, if that's
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.980]   a little more attractive, then that's a good thing.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:00.180]   If you have people on the fence that are just like, "I know enough about this code and I
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:05.380]   just want to find vulnerabilities for fun," now who should I tell about them?
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:09.140]   Offering these kind of bounties is a good thing.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.660]   And Google's spending a lot of money on other things too.
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:18.180]   Apparently, $5.03 million on lobbying wasn't that long ago when we were bemoaning the fact
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.180]   that tech companies just they aren't represented on the hill.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.100]   They're not up there spending the money.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.500]   $5.03 million, according to the New York Times on Monday.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.100]   That's bigger than a lot of tobacco companies.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.220]   Which I guess they're on the decline in a way, but still.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:38.580]   Well, this may be the time I want to mention something I was at yesterday.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:43.500]   Union Square Ventures in New York held an event called Hacking Society, an amazing group
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:48.780]   there among the Yohai Bankler, John Perry Barlow, Bram Cohen.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.780]   Wow, great crowd.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:55.220]   Stephen Johnson, Larry Lessig, Mike Bazznick, Beth Novick, Craig Newmark, always good for
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:57:01.940]   a punchline, Tim O'Reilly, Alexis O'Honey, and Yancey Strickler and others.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.620]   So it was an amazing group, plus venture capitalist, plus others, plus I managed to
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.020]   sneak in.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.060]   And it was about how do we keep going after some of the people?
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:15.060]   How do we worry about how to hack society and how to have networks that really turned
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.500]   into how do we protect the internet?
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.620]   And there was the only heated moment in there.
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:23.820]   It was when one of the people in the room said that you need to hire your own lobbyists.
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:28.700]   You need to buy your own congressman and others about puked at that idea.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:32.900]   And there was kind of a view of do we hack around the problem of politics or do we have
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.380]   to face it head on and do we have to face it head on in politics ways?
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.820]   So this goes to Google spending this much money on lobbying.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:43.020]   Google's obviously doing it for its own problems and its own PR problems and its own issues.
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:47.220]   But it goes to the larger issue, and Tim O'Reilly said it very well in the end, that we have
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:51.820]   to have the narrative of the net.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.900]   And that narrative is about numbers and how the net has value to society and how we quantify
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.140]   that and we catalog that.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:02.380]   And it's about anecdotes and memes of people talking about how the net has made a difference
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:03.380]   in their lives.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:04.860]   We've never gotten good at that.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:06.540]   Then once you have that, what do you do with that?
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:11.020]   Well, you want to sell it to the public, but you also need to sell it to Congress.
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:14.780]   John Perry Barlow said that, or maybe somebody else maybe said that one of the problems,
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:21.220]   and so the people was that the members of Congress were turning back stories, anecdotes,
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.900]   because they got fed them by the lobbyists from Hollywood.
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:26.540]   We on our side didn't feed them any anecdotes.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.940]   You could argue that that's corrupt lobbying or you could argue that that's a necessary
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.940]   thing.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.860]   And then Yochai Banker proposed a pledge that politicians should take before they get our
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.660]   votes of money, which is an internet freedom pledge, a very simple thing, any party.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.900]   You don't do it, you don't get the vote.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:47.580]   So it was an interesting group, an interesting discussion, and I'm not sure it got to any
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.100]   destinations.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.820]   But if Google is spending money on lobbying, yes, they're doing it for their own purposes.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.180]   Yes, they have to do that.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:59:00.940]   But it's also part of a larger question of, do we finally educate Congress?
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:04.740]   Do we, are we willing to not vote for Al Franken, even though we like him otherwise, because
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:05.740]   he's defending Hollywood?
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:09.980]   These are some of the things we have to start considering as a community.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.580]   How do we make sure that Google is representing our interests?
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.460]   If they're going to be outspending everyone else, they're going to be pursuing Google's
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.460]   interests.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.460]   Of course they're.
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:21.020]   That's fair.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.100]   And they may be on your side on a lot of issues, but then again, they may not.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.100]   Precisely.
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:30.740]   My example always is I think Google did the right thing finally in getting out of China,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:35.900]   but then they turned around and did the devil's deal with Verizon on net neutrality, wired
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:39.740]   note net neutrality, wireless internet versus Schmidt Internet.
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.140]   And yeah, Google was following its own interests because it had gotten better with Verizon
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.500]   and then it needs to.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:50.060]   And I hope there are a lot of people at Google who hate that too, but they crossed a line
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.980]   there and no, they are not there to represent our interests.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:58.460]   As much as I'm a certified Google fan boy, they are not the representatives of Internet
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.460]   Nation.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:06.500]   But I think the closest that we have, I mean, of all the companies that are advocating for
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.020]   the open web, don't you feel like Google gets the closest?
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.140]   On the power to issue ratio, they're probably the closest.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.140]   They have the most.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.140]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:16.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.340]   You know, and part of what was asked for two years, there was early warning signals,
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:24.140]   which, you know, EFF is out there, but EFF was saying that, you know, we don't know everything
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.220]   that's coming down the pike.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.220]   That's the problem.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.500]   We only know some proportion of it.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:32.700]   Clay Shurkey was arguing for an Internet fire brigade where the people who were masked together
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:37.620]   against so many people could be kind of called together again in a true emergency.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.260]   Sounds good and Clay's brilliant, but I don't know that that is going to work practically.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.700]   So yes, you know, you're right.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.060]   The best we have right now is Google.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:49.180]   And Google, I've heard this marriage, but they don't want to be in that position.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.060]   They don't want to be the ambassadors of the Internet.
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:52.940]   They don't want to be the governance of the Internet.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.140]   They don't want to be the policemen of the Internet.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.300]   Many of those things.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.620]   But right now, if we don't do it, then we're putting them in their position and we better
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:06.060]   trust them to do it, then we better not complain when there's no one else fighting for our
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.100]   interests against Verizon when they end up in bed with Verizon.
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:13.740]   And frankly, as Google gets larger, it gets harder for them to be true to their own ideals,
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.740]   much less anybody else's.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740]   Yes.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:23.180]   Because, you know, because they become no longer Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as much influence
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:28.740]   as Larry Page has and as much command as he's taken and focused it, Google is bigger than
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.300]   everyone who works there.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.860]   They're an F-ing phone company.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.740]   You don't like phone companies.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.740]   Right.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:40.180]   There was a great moment when I think it was Yancy's Frickler said that, you know, the
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:43.260]   whole day started with the notion of how do you know a network when you see it?
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:49.380]   And somebody said a network is when you say, ah, and it's not a network when you say,
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:58.780]   so you say Kickstarter, Reddit, Verizon.
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:06.340]   And so what Yancy said was that a company like his, he believes, tries to educate its
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.340]   users.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.980]   He had educated customers that you want smarter users.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.220]   That's the view.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:16.900]   And the Clay Shurky popped in with a line from, I think, it was Scott Adams that as opposed
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.900]   to the confuse up only.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.660]   And that's our phone companies, our cable companies and companies like that that try
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:25.980]   to just confuse the heck out of us.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.940]   I just have an AT&T.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.020]   I have the international AT&T because I go off on it.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:35.740]   I pay $100 a month for 100 megs of international data that I rarely use.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.420]   I use it, but I use it so sporadically.
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.580]   I don't know when I'm going to need it.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.580]   So I don't.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.500]   You don't want to go through the, the, the, the.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   On and off.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.500]   Yesterday.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.500]   I actually paid a hundred nineteen.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.700]   Yesterday to change something else.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.060]   And I saw that I could get 275 for a hundred.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.060]   Now why didn't they just change me?
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.260]   Why have they been ripping me off that level for the same amount of money?
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.260]   Because that's what we do.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:57.260]   That's how we make money.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.260]   It's capitalism.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.260]   It's free market.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.260]   Right.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.420]   I would never capitalism can really be better.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.380]   But, but so if we're going to think like ecosystems and networks and we're going to think
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:09.060]   like the open internet, we're going to preserve that open internet to create this new society,
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:15.140]   you know, it all started off to or ended off with somebody from, I forget where, quoting
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.180]   Joey Edo in the op-ed he did the New York Times a while ago saying starting off with
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.940]   this sentence, the internet is a belief system.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:25.740]   And I've argued in the show often that we have to have a discussion of principles.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:31.300]   And that's where the discussion has to start, not into the weeds of this reg or that reg,
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.900]   this Congress person, that Congress person, this suit or that cert.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.740]   If we don't have a discussion level of principles, we're going to get messed up.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.420]   So sorry to go off on this rant.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.420]   No, no, it's great.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:41.420]   That's just a pleasure.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.420]   I think it ties in.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.420]   It ties in.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:49.480]   Lobby. It does. It starts with the idea of lobbying and it partially explains why Google
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:55.620]   is making this huge effort. Cash Hill over at Forbes has a great rundown of at least
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:03.060]   seven big categories of legislation that begin to explain why Google would be so engaged
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:08.400]   in Washington. I think they probably reach the conclusion that in order to hack Washington
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:14.540]   this is what you do. You send your lobbyists there and it's an education effort.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:21.680]   Well power lies where people believe it lies. I learned that from the Game of Thrones.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:30.800]   It's just shadows on the wall. Exactly. Thank you. I was going to say like the best and
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.920]   worst thing about geeks is that they look at a crappy system and they just want to like
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.520]   rebuild the entire thing from scratch. But the reality is that in some situations you
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:45.480]   have to work within the crappy system first before you take the whole thing down. So that's
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.820]   how I feel about the gut lobbying. It's the buyer build decision. It is. It's totally
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:58.480]   the buyer. Totally. Society. It's a way. I was thinking about you often yesterday because
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   you know I quoted you often at this point that that hackers hack around and sometimes
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.240]   you can't hack around sometimes you have to face it. And that's what that was a lot of
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.000]   the divide yesterday. But it came. It was distasteful when when it was named name a
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.160]   wolf was talking about how you have to hire lobbyists. You have to raise money. You have
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:21.440]   to you know kind of buy your Congress better others. And and and I find it distasteful
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.840]   too. But John Perry Barlow said that he used to be you know a wholehearted libertarian
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:31.120]   and kind of territorial done. He said that we need some legacy institutions to continue.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:36.440]   We need to continue smarter. We can't get rid of them all. You know you we do need a mix
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.840]   and I agree with that. But we are in the process of reinventing these institutions wholeheartedly.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.560]   And you get it's a beautiful way to put it's buyer build and Tom too that sometimes you
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:51.240]   have to rebuild and you have to disrupt and you have to leave the past. And I think that's
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.320]   what happening in news to a great extent. But sometimes you can't afford the price of
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.320]   that much disruption.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:02.960]   I'm sorry I'm laughing at Coyote Brown in the chat room. He says a Google engineer, a
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.480]   Senator, an adventure capitalist each bit a common cell sort to kill the other two who
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:15.520]   lives who dies. Well played.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.760]   Real quickly we got to speak in a pain bills. We got to pay ours in a second. But I like
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:26.000]   what you're saying about the the or when we say I wish I could think who said that. But
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.600]   it was not my line. Yeah when we say Google what what's your reaction? Ah there we go
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.400]   again. I still am in the our columns. Things they do after all these years. But I'm still
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.440]   in the odd column. Yeah, sure. Given what they did today what we just announced. I think
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:46.640]   there's a lot of a in that. What about you guys? Denise what about you? When they announced
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:52.200]   today Google Drive. Oh Google Drive. Well yes. I think there's a lot of eye in in what Google
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200]   does in general.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:00.200]   I'm in the odd column too. Gina you're still on. Yeah I'm still on. I'm still on. I'm.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:12.200]   I don't know how to get the Leo. How do we name the show this? That's going to be.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:18.920]   Google makes you say. I don't know about that. All right. Speaking of Leo. He's he's
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.720]   got a button again and tell you about another great sponsor that we have for this week
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.800]   in Google. Thank you Tom. I don't want to horn in but I'm here from Norway actually.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:34.720]   It's amazing. It looks just like my office talking about carbonite online backup. If
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.840]   you heard Steve Gibson I think he was kind of surprised and security now he did a review
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:43.360]   of all the cloud backup or cloud actually wasn't a backup review is about cloud storage
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.400]   like Dropbox and stuff. And he said you know what carbonite is actually really good. I
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:53.040]   was pretty pleased unlimited backup. Fifty nine dollars that's less than five bucks a
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:08:00.480]   month for everything on your internal hard drive secure reliable backup for fifty nine
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:06.880]   bucks a year carbonite dot com Mac or PC this is great. Now if you have a PC and an external
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.520]   drive or multiple PCs they've got a solution for that as well just visit carbonite dot

[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:48.800]   me next two weeks use the offer code twig and back we go to our round table already in
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:56.720]   progress Tom thank you Leo and come back soon from the cold fjords please. Before we get
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.400]   to our tool tip and number any other stories here we want thank you so much for talking
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:06.640]   about hacking society by the way Jeff that was good stuff. We mentioned the self driving
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.400]   car with Detroit anything more to mention on that one. Well that one is about that one
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.800]   is they say it could also be an aftermarket product so you know imagine getting your old
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.640]   Volkswagen Beetle and suddenly it's a self driving Beetle you can call it oh no I'm missing
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.160]   the punch line. What was the name of the car? Herbie Herbie. Herbie you can get the true
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:31.400]   Herbie. Could I I'd like to Herbie the love bug my my car please. That's really they said
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.720]   that that's really cool. Cool. I'd like to ask the group one question. Sure. You really
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.280]   think there's money to be made in asteroids planetary. What is it planetary resources
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.120]   is that the name of that we covered this on tech news today yesterday. Yeah planetary
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.160]   resources Inc co founded by Eric Anderson of space adventures so the guy has done space
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.320]   tourism already and Peter Diamandis of the X prize foundation so he's figured out how
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.600]   to give people money to start private ventures into space. They could actually coming up.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.160]   We've got one of our first trips to the International Space Station from a private company. So they
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.760]   want to mine asteroids. There are 9,000 asteroids that are greater than 150 feet in diameter
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:17.680]   near earth. Some they think could have more platinum than is mined on earth than a year
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:23.640]   just on the one asteroid. The the trick is getting your robotic ship to the right asteroid
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.960]   mining the platinum refining it and getting it back down to earth without spending six
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:35.560]   billion dollars. It's a big trick. Yeah. I want to take my own take my space elevator
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:43.960]   up there for asteroids cropping up as well. Well actually actually actually counselor.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:49.880]   There was discussion about in some of the stories about the state of space law and where
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:54.560]   the claim title to an asteroid. Yeah. Yeah. The one I read I think was the Wired
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:01.560]   ad that said that the nearest analog is the seabed mining rights and international waters.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:06.360]   Now I'm pretty sure I don't know Denise are you an expert in international seabed mining
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:12.200]   law? Yeah probably not. But that's a good analogy.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:17.360]   But yeah I mean how does that work? I mean how do we come up with law in space where
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.720]   everyone's just kind of laughed you know for many decades it was like well that's not
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.960]   even an issue. We don't have to worry about that. If somebody wants to go and start mining
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.600]   and asteroid did they get to just go do that? I don't know I can't stop thinking about law
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.360]   in space. I think that's what most of us were thinking.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   Yeah I think that there has been some interesting stuff around that and different ventures that
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:50.160]   have been proposed for going to the moon and doing things. So I think it's a bridge yet
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:57.480]   to be crossed. Yeah a space bridge. Yes. Why don't you just ask this? Who would buy
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:04.000]   stock in this venture? Well how much? I would totally buy it. I mean I can't because I cover
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.120]   it but but I would. I absolutely would unless it was really expensive but just a few shares
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.360]   I'm not going to like sink sink my investments in it but just to say like yeah I own a little
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.280]   bit of that asteroid mining company. I mean that's just a cool factor alone.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:26.720]   All right all right Gina. No. I mean you know I get the cool factor if I was you know
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:33.480]   truly wanted to make my do I think it's a good investment right at the moment. It's a
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:41.480]   lot of unknown. It's the great unknown Jeff. It is. I didn't have Rich Amaya in the scenario.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:47.560]   You know I even take the top. I wonder what Tom's made us saying right now. You will not
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:55.080]   invest our money in that. Honey can I buy some space stock? See me and we're right right
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.760]   there. She's like we're Lord and Lady just recently. That's true. Our friend Terpster
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.720]   in England bought us a lordship so perfect on a side note. So we have in that we have
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.480]   in the hall. It's Wansley Manor. No it's not in Harrenhal. Harrenhal is all melted.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.680]   I couldn't buy that place. I know horrible real estate. I was wondering what kind of
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.720]   gift it was. Yeah. Yes we were not gifted to Harrenhal thank goodness. That's a bad idea.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.640]   Game of Thrones reference if you don't understand what we're talking about. Anything else before
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:31.880]   we move on that you guys want to talk about? We've got real quick. All right one more.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.960]   So did when Microsoft resold Microsoft bought patents from AOL for real. Yeah yeah. They
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:45.000]   sold a bunch to Facebook for $550 million and they both get to use both of them because
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.040]   AOL would not allow group bids. Was that screwing AOL or because it competes with Facebook
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.280]   but didn't compete with Microsoft or nah that's the way it goes it's okay. That's a you know
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.000]   it's an interesting question. I mean and there's the other side of this is Facebook
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.560]   is going to use it to go after Yahoo who is a partner with Microsoft. So Microsoft just
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.400]   armed Facebook against Yahoo. What a tank web we've we they mess up Yahoo and AOL it's
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:17.040]   like pre-world war one Europe. Yeah. I don't I you know I think AOL probably doesn't care
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.560]   they didn't want people grouping up to bid I don't know for what reason why wouldn't they
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.000]   want them to group up to bid. Wouldn't that mean bigger bids because people could pool
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.680]   their money together. I would think so. So I guess they wanted to keep it out of the
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.480]   hands of competitors but Microsoft figured out a way around it. They're like well once
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.600]   we own it we can sell it to whoever we want. We're going to sell some to Facebook. But
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.280]   obviously Microsoft to Facebook planned it that way because it was on a dime. As soon
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:46.400]   as Microsoft got the patents from AOL they took a bunch of them and licensed them and
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.440]   sold a bunch of them to Facebook and now Yahoo is calling them up about the big deal
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.280]   like wait a minute. What are you doing? But everybody is mad at Yahoo for the patent lawsuit
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.080]   against Facebook. So I think Microsoft is probably a little pretty safe like look Yahoo
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:06.400]   nobody's on your side in this one even us. So let it go. All right. Thank you. All right.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.440]   Let's get to Gina's tip. What do you got for us this week? It's actually just a Google
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:16.320]   Drive related tip that we talked about a little bit earlier. There are apps as we talked about
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.640]   that you can install to access Google Drive. It's not really it's not really easy to see
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:26.200]   where you can install them. Once you do have drive and it's enabled it will it will replace
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:32.320]   Docs and Docs now drive has that big red create button. When you click on the create
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.960]   button there's a more link and there's then there's a link to get more apps and that will
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.760]   lead you to the Chrome Web Store which has all the apps the Chrome apps that save to Google
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.200]   Drive. From there you can see some of the apps that we talked about earlier. We video
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.640]   and mind mind stir and aviary which is an imaging app and so you can install any one
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.880]   of those apps and then you can save files back to your drive from it. That was kind of
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.360]   my just tip for installing apps that access Google Drive. My second tip is if you're really
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.560]   worried about privacy and you want to keep you want to encrypt your files before you
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.160]   put them anywhere. If you're really worried about someone opening up a Google or anyone
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:12.720]   be able to see your files just encrypt them before you transfer them. I use a open source
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.920]   product called TrueCrypt which works on a cross platform. Encrypt anything before you
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.280]   upload it to a cloud service provider if you're really really really worried about privacy.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.960]   >> That's actually a very responsible thing that you should consider doing.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:32.480]   >> Yeah absolutely. I had a tax account come to me and say you know I've got all my clients
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.680]   returns with their social security numbers and their financial histories and you know I feel
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.840]   a little wary about storing them in you know some cloud service provider and I said yes
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.920]   that you should feel wary. Just you know encrypt those and save them in an encrypted volume
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.680]   before you upload them so at least you have that extra level of protections your client's data.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   It's personal private data. You don't want to go anywhere. You don't want to be transferring
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:00.800]   in the clear or anything like that. Not a lot of us are dealing with you know the social security
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   numbers of our clients but if there is something you're really worried about you can either
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.840]   plenty of tools out there that will help you encrypt things. I think there's an Apple script
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.720]   that's going around as well that on the Mac will automatically encrypt files that you drop into a
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.800]   folder. >> Shouldn't you encrypt them on your hard drive anyway in case your machine gets stolen
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:22.240]   and you're liable? >> Well yeah there's that right exactly yes. >> And then you should use TrueCrypt
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.120]   to create the hidden volume so that when you're accustomed and they ask you to type in your TrueCrypt
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.400]   password you can type in a password but it gives them an empty volume of the operating system.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.880]   >> Right. >> Oh that's why I like TrueCrypt. They do sneaky stuff like that.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.880]   >> I also like the name because it sounds like an FX series. >> True. >> Coming to FX.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:47.360]   >> Only from the minds of FX. TrueCrypt. Denise do you have anything in that? I don't know if we
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.200]   asked you for anything ahead of time. I don't mean to put you on the spot but if you've got a tip
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.440]   or a tool or anything like that you want to pass along. >> Just kind of a follow on to just
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:05.360]   discussion of hacking society. There was a great program at the Brooklyn Law Incubator and Policy
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:11.280]   Clinic that was kind of in the same vein. They had a legal hackathon last weekend.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.520]   I don't know if you know these guys Jeff but Jonathan asked over there. >> Jonathan's just
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.400]   great. He helps my entrepreneurial students in incredible ways. He is just wonderful. >> Right.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.880]   So just a shout out to them and great job at having a legal hackathon. One of the things they did was
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:34.880]   try and hack together something that was better than SOPA and PIPA. I actually have a few submissions
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:40.320]   from that hackathon that I need to go through and judge that I haven't done so yet. So I just
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.640]   like the idea I encourage more law schools to follow their lead. >> Very cool. Very cool. All right.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.880]   >> Mr. Jarvis, you have a number for us. >> Well, it's what we know but I love Henry Blodgett on
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:58.480]   Business Insider takes the obnoxious story that should be on one page and making it into a 20-page
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:03.280]   slideshow to its extremes. But sometimes it's fun to watch him get himself in the lather.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:09.520]   So he did one on Apple's results that said that Apple went from a 100 million in five years,
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.880]   went from zero to 100 million as iPhones alone. Say that again. The iPhone business alone went
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:20.720]   from zero to 100 million in five years. >> Wow. >> But wait, there's more. Apple generates
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:27.760]   $7 million in cash per hour. But that's not all. It has $100 billion in cash, which makes the
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.520]   37th largest country's economy. But wait, there's even more. Call now we're going to tell you that
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:39.440]   Apple's profit was bigger than Google's revenue, which is pretty darn. >> Apple's profit was bigger.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.440]   Keep that in mind. Revenue is everything. Profits revenue minus costs. >> Is that
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:50.640]   unspeakable? >> Oh, snap. >> They are cheap at Apple. They don't spend money on anything.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:56.800]   That's crazy. Numbers, I should have said. >> Numbers.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:04.240]   >> Do you do COD? Or if I use my credit card, do I get a bonus?
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:09.680]   All right. I've got a tool. Actually, I'm prepared this time. I do this week at Google two weeks
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.680]   in a row. I end up being prepared. I have a tool that I just installed this past week. I use
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:22.560]   simple note to manage my to-do lists, actually. It's a hack-together system of my own. But all I
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:28.240]   have is I have a next actions, a waiting, and a projects list in simple note that I can access
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:33.600]   in the cloud on any of my devices. For my Mac laptop, I use notational velocity. But I've been
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.720]   looking for a better solution for my Windows desktop. And I ran across a Chrome extension,
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:47.680]   which actually works on OS X Chrome, called SyncPad for simple note. I'll just use this on Windows.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:53.920]   I think I may end up using it on OS X as well. It installs this little notepad icon up in the
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:01.520]   upper right of your Chrome browser. And then when you drop it down, it just gives you all of your
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:12.720]   simple notes. It opens up. You can edit them. You can say, remember to tweet about Twig.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.680]   There it goes. Now it's synced to all. It's synced to my phone. It's synced to my tablet.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.960]   It's synced to my Windows desktop. And then when I'm done, I just pop it away. It's great.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.640]   Very nice. You live in the Vida text file, Tom?
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:33.280]   I know, right? I'm pretty much hacked together, something like that. And it's so easy. It just
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:40.960]   works for me to do it that way. So SyncPad, SYNC, PAD for simple note, is the way I'm doing it.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.920]   All right. That's it for this week in Google. I promise I mean it this time. Leo will be back
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.280]   next week, right? With Herring in hand. Yes, yes. He will be back next week.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:57.600]   Backbearing Herring. Sure. Sure. He'll be telling us winter is coming.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:06.000]   Let me tell it us. Winter is back there. I left it in Norway. I was at the wall.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.240]   All right. Denise, Hal, thank you so much for joining us. It's a great having you.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.600]   Two shows at less than a week. What a pleasure. Let folks know about this week in law where they
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.200]   can find that and all the other stuff you do online. We record this week in law right here.

[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:34.080]   Google is done. We'll see you next time.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:44.800]   We have puppetry going on back here. Sorry. Yeah.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:52.640]   Go to Tom's single if you can. There we go. What's happening? And then can you just play the audio
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.960]   of DDR one? The audio of DDR one. Okay. Well, I don't know if I can. Sure. Yeah. You can't play.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.440]   This is going to make sure. I'll just play it. Okay. Hold on. Hey, Tom, if you don't mind,
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.880]   I'd like to take a little break during the show. Nope.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.160]   I'm going to go to my.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:20.640]   It's like he's right here with me.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:27.040]   The other audio? Yeah. The one where he says horn in or the choice.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.840]   I don't want to horn in, but I'm here from Norway.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:40.560]   Talking about car. If you heard Steve Gibson, I think he was kind of surprised and security.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.480]   Now he did a. Oh, he was surprised. All right. Okay.
