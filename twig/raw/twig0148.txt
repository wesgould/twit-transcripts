[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.560]   And I want to say, right up front,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.040]   just so you don't know false billing, no false advertising
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.280]   here, Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, whatever
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.480]   the hell we want to talk about, including occasionally
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.440]   Chipotle, Glee, and Habermas.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.920]   Speaking of Habermas, here he is.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.080]   It's 4.30 in the morning or some ungodly hour in Korea.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   He's in Seoul at the airport, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, flying home from?
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.360]   From Seoul after Sydney last week.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.440]   And then I finally get home.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   I leave at 10 o'clock this morning in Seoul time
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.560]   and arrive at 11 o'clock at New York time.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.520]   Were you doing a conference in South Korea?
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.280]   What were you doing?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.960]   Yeah, this was the Seoul Digital Forum,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.080]   which is a big broadcaster here.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.920]   It tries to-- I think it's kind of their tiddish thing.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.400]   Neat.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   So it was fun.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.720]   Bill O'Reilly was here, not Bill O'Reilly, Tim O'Reilly,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.040]   and Kevin Kelly and some other good folks.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.200]   Oh, Neat.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.280]   Is it an O'Reilly event or just--
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.760]   No, no, no, not at all, no, they might--
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.000]   I got the O'Reilly's.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.600]   I'm just going to watch him watch a conference being run.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.280]   Yes, I bet.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.720]   He says some of the best, actually.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.400]   He's very good at it.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.000]   Well, we're so-- I can't tell you how grateful we are.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.560]   I know what a hardship this must be for you, Jeff.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.000]   You even changed hotels, I think, so that you could do this.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.680]   So thank you.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.920]   My honor and pleasure, because I was in the Seoul subway yesterday,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.040]   and someone came up and said, you Jeff Jarvis is doing well.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.160]   No way.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   That is amazing.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.400]   And that is-- That's very cool.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.720]   That's very cool.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.440]   Jeff is the author of this great book,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.400]   What Would Private Parts Do?
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.760]   I think I've combined two books into one.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.440]   Don't ask me that question.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.040]   It's a previous book, What Would Google Do?
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.360]   It's a current book, Public Parts from Simon and Schuster.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.120]   And very, very good stuff, very, very good stuff.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.400]   And I love it that on the back, it's all tweet Twitter.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.760]   Instead of the normal log rolling,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.280]   it's all tweets.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.440]   Good job.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.800]   Gina Trapani is also here.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.120]   She is from smarterware.org, founding editor at Life Hacker,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.600]   also a big Android user and an Android programmer.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.200]   We like to get the programming point of view.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.760]   Thank you for being here, Gina.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.360]   Great to be here again, just kind of living my boring life here
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   in San Diego.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.240]   I'm just kind of hold up alone in my home office all week.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.000]   And this is my one hour of the week.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.520]   Hey.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.000]   I get to talk to other humans.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.280]   So my one social hour, unlike Jeff, who's traveling the world.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.720]   Are you coding, coding, coding?
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.920]   Is that what you're doing?
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.800]   Yeah, I'm basically coding full time on ThinkUp.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.640]   Oh, that's exciting.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.680]   A couple of other most part and a couple of other little projects.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.280]   But for the most part, ThinkUp, yeah.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.920]   That's really great.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.760]   Are you headed towards a big number point release
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.720]   or something or--
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.680]   Yeah, we're working on 2.0 right now.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   Mm.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.720]   Exciting.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.080]   Yes.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.360]   That's exciting.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.040]   Oh, and let's not forget Gutenberg, the private part.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.520]   That's another book that Jeff wrote.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.160]   Sorry.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.880]   Big story, and I think it's a good one for you, Gina.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.840]   This just broke moments ago, the jury
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:37.200]   ruled on Oracle versus Google, no patent infringement found.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.240]   10 person jury found today that Google did not
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.000]   infringe two Java related patents that Oracle had used
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.240]   to sue the search giant.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.720]   That means Oracle is probably not going to get anything.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.080]   Maybe a tiny amount of damages from one copied function.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.880]   This is the end of a six week trial.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.240]   Must have been very expensive, some of the best lawyers
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.160]   in the nation trying the case.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160]   The judge noted it was the longest civil trial
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.080]   he had ever presided over, six weeks.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.400]   The waste, oh, the waste.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.680]   What a waste.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.480]   Oracle may still get the opportunity
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.120]   to retry the copyright case.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.640]   So to understand that we're really two cases, copyright
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.960]   infringement and patent infringement.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.600]   And then they've verdict on the copyright.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.480]   It was just kind of weird.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.640]   It's kind of a weird non-vertix, right?
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.120]   It was-- the fair use decision was never really made.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.280]   They didn't decide on the most important thing.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.560]   Right, right.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.360]   But this is a big win for Google, right?
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   Because basically, I mean, the most they're going to pay
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.520]   is I think it's like 150 grand of damages
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   for that one copied method, which is that range check method.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   The Xerox bill for the lawyers was more than that.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.680]   Right, exactly.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.760]   And I think there were those eight other test files,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.000]   which were also a copy.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.400]   There might be minor damages for that.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.560]   But this is-- yeah, Google keeps that kind of money
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.600]   in their bathrooms.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.280]   So it's a big win for Google.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.320]   Robert Vanest, the lead attorney for the Google,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.080]   said we are grateful for the jury's verdict.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.800]   Today's jury's verdict that Android does not
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.160]   infringe Oracle's patents was a victory, not just for Google,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.600]   but the entire Android ecosystem.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.280]   Oracle--
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.360]   folks, I don't know what that was.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.160]   Deborah Allenger, we're doing sound effects now.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.640]   Presented-- Oracle presented overwhelming evidence
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.600]   of trial that Google knew it would fragment and damage Java.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.760]   We plan to continue to defend and uphold Java's core right
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.000]   runs, run anywhere principal, and ensure
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.640]   it is protected for the 9 million Java developers
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.320]   in the community dependent on Java compatibility,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.360]   in other words, we're going to appeal this one.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.520]   This is not over.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.120]   Yeah, it's not quite over.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.560]   But the judge was pretty great.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.120]   I mean, roundly sort of louded for how level-headed and clear
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.400]   mind that he was about it, the fact
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.600]   that he knows how to code, kind of love that.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.320]   I mean, this whole trial was kind of a bummer.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.520]   I kind of felt like Google was in the right,
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.280]   but I still don't love the way.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.240]   I still feel like they mishandled the whole thing.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.320]   And as a Java developer, Java's right ones
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.280]   run anywhere.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.080]   Ethos is very much in line with Google's commitment
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.720]   to openness.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.800]   And it bums me out that the two companies,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.200]   that it came to this, that they weren't
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.880]   able to figure this out earlier, sooner.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.080]   I mean, Oracle saw $1.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.960]   Some was not thrilled, but kind of went along with it.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.520]   It was just the whole thing was kind of a bummer.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.400]   I don't know if I was rooting for either side, really.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   Right.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.040]   I hate to see patent cases over stuff like this.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.240]   On the other hand, if Google really did, just kind of say,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.400]   hey, we don't have to paint it.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.080]   And we're just going to use Java.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.880]   Telling everybody, that's not so cool either.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.000]   Right.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.800]   It isn't.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.840]   So I don't know.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.640]   I just don't know.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.520]   But anyway--
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.920]   So in a world without software patents, which is what folks
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.200]   like us are saying we need, what would the impact be?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.120]   So let's say Google did Nick use of the software.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.320]   Oracle wasn't really hurt.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.080]   That's a question.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.840]   Who was damaged?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.240]   What is the assertion?
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.520]   What is the damage that, well, you should have paid us.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.200]   You should have given us money.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   Is that the only assertion?
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.040]   They're lawyers saying it's fragmenting
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.000]   because they made their own Java virtual machine.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.160]   It's fragmenting the right--
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.680]   It's OK.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.240]   It's an issue of control over your invention.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   All right.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.400]   Well, that's more legitimate.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.760]   I mean, I think it was more like the idea that the Java APIs--
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.200]   if you buy a Java license that has to adhere to a set
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.240]   of standards, that Oracle kind of puts forth--
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.560]   You can't change the API calls.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.920]   I mean, you don't want to change the API calls
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.520]   because it does create fragmentation.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.960]   And now, suddenly, Java developers
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.840]   are building against two different interfaces.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.200]   And that stinks.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.520]   It leads to this fragmentation and non-standardization.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.080]   And so--
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.520]   And yeah, we don't want to set up a world where
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.480]   you could copyright an API and say, that's copyrighted.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:17.920]   Do we?
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.120]   Right.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.920]   I mean, I don't think there's anything
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.040]   wrong with anyone making a different virtual machine.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.600]   I mean, the whole point of Java is
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.440]   that you write the code once and it can run
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.720]   on lots of different devices.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.000]   From what I understood, the Dalvik virtual machine
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.040]   wasn't the issue.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.920]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.840]   I thought that it was because Dalvik implemented APIs
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.880]   that weren't that were non-standard.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.440]   Is that--
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.160]   Well, that's--
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.480]   I mean, if you're not writing--
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.200]   and if you're not writing a virtual machine that
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.840]   claims to be Java, you can have any API you want.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.240]   Well, right.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.600]   I mean, that's part of the issue, too,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.520]   is that Android never used the Java name or trademark symbol
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.080]   or branding.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.120]   But the reality is that Android got Java
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.800]   into the pockets of millions and millions of people.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.920]   And Linux, let's not forget.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.000]   Yes.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And made Linux one of the most used operating systems.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.520]   No?
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.600]   I don't know.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.480]   I just-- I don't know.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.760]   We tried to get some expert--
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.320]   expert people.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   Nobody wants to touch this.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.720]   Everyone's just sort of exhausted and consulting.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.880]   Like, you know--
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.200]   You know, six weeks isn't bad.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.320]   Didn't the Microsoft thing go on for years?
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.960]   I mean, I don't-- I'm just glad it's over.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.680]   Maybe.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.600]   Maybe it's not over.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.280]   Maybe there's more.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.760]   Ah, OK.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.760]   There's much more we can talk about.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.080]   Well, as long as we'll do patents,
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.120]   we'll do one more patent story, which
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.080]   is the TerraHop story, which is kind of an interesting story.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:55.920]   This is almost like Google helping out TerraHop customers
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.760]   or something.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.840]   So TerraHop-- and they're two startup companies--
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:11.440]   Tamarack and TerraHop, which were run by a guy named
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.440]   Seattle Investment Professional named Mark Spangler.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.000]   He was indicted last week on 23 counts of fraud and money
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.560]   laundering, saying he funneled $46 million
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   of investors funds into startups that he held interest
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.320]   in called Tamarack and TerraHop.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.960]   TerraHop flocked last year, filed for bankruptcy.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   A court-appointed receivership was established
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.200]   to manage the assets.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.240]   And apparently, Google has now paid $10 million
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.760]   to TerraHop for their patents.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.200]   Most of that money will go to those investors who got ripped
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.360]   off by Spangler.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:52.440]   So Google's just beefing up their defensive patent
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:52.800]   bar total.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   Yeah, it kind of is a happy ending for everybody.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.280]   The fraud and investors get some of their money back.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.440]   The patent's actually not insignificant.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.720]   TerraHop was going to sell to big companies
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.280]   to manage their shipping containers and stuff.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.520]   So the patents include an antenna in a cargo container
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.760]   monitoring and security system, visually capturing
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.800]   and monitoring contents and events of a cargo container,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.160]   and radio frequency identification based sensors
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.520]   and others.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.880]   They're mostly RFID type patents.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.560]   Oh, they're going to track us.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.080]   Well--
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.600]   I put that do not track story in the rundown, Jeff,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.320]   just because I wanted to hear you talk about that.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.800]   I love that.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.240]   We will.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.600]   We will.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   That's a good story.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.160]   We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:37.660]   The Twitter--
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.920]   I think it at 4.30 in the morning, Jeff
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.840]   needed a little extra--
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.680]   Ah, this is better than coffee.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.360]   Actually, it's what we did.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.640]   We talked about it a lot on security now.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.120]   Twitter doing the right thing with the do not track.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.320]   But we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.160]   Gina and Jeff are here.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.280]   This show brought to you by our good friends at Citrix,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.760]   who do the best remote access software out there.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.960]   If you're an enterprise, you know the name Citrix.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.240]   That's like the enterprise remote access.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.000]   For consumers, they've got a great solution.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.720]   Same, speedy, secure, remote access.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.440]   But it's easy to install, easy to use.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.280]   You don't need the IT department to get involved.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.920]   You don't need to punch a hole in the firewall.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.720]   It's called GoToMyPC.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.200]   And it works great.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.760]   128-bit SSL.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.800]   So it's actually--
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.440]   I mean, this is not the main reason you'd use it.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.640]   But just it happens to be, if you're in an open access spot,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.880]   you use GoToMyPC to surf to your office computer.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.240]   Then surf to the rest of the world.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.960]   You've got a VPN, basically.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.040]   It lets you really work your office computer
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.280]   from anywhere, from home, from the road,
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.000]   from any PC, Mac or PC, or--
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.560]   and I love this.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:46.360]   Now you can use GoToMyPC with your iPad, or your iPhone,
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.560]   or your Android tablet.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.040]   There's the iPhone app.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.360]   It's free.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.200]   So is the Android tablet app.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.600]   So this means you really can't access your office
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.040]   computer anywhere, from anything, very mobile.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.000]   Just take that iPhone or iPad or Android tablet with you
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.960]   on the road, and you are able to get in there.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.280]   You see the keyboard that pops up?
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.840]   You can type.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.960]   You can access any document, run the spreadsheets,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.240]   run the what word processor, databases, any network
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.520]   resource.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.720]   You literally could run Photoshop,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.960]   all with GoToMyPC and a tablet or a iPhone.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.280]   I want you to try it right now, free for 30 days.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.560]   Visit GoToMyPC.com.

[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.880]   It's really kind of cool.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.920]   Offer code TWIG, GoToMyPC.com.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.000]   Try it today from the great folks at Citrix.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.280]   We thank them for their support.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   It really is a very cool thing if you travel.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.360]   It's Motorola.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.760]   No, GoGoRola.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.720]   Google--
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.840]   It's official.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.800]   The acquisition, that went through pretty quick.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.720]   The $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Google
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.160]   is done.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.360]   Google is now a hardware company, Babies.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:17.480]   This happened May 22nd at 5.53 AM.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.640]   At least that's when the blog was posted.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.000]   Blog post was posted.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.800]   So what are they going to do with it?
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.200]   They're not clear about.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.040]   That's the question.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.880]   Yeah, Motorola made the StarTAC.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.440]   I've had Motorola phones for ages.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.400]   I wasn't really crazy about the droids.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.840]   They briefly, the droid was like the best Android phone,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.600]   but quickly eclipsed the droid.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.760]   But Verizon is pretty much a droid heavy place.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.600]   They love the droids.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:55.440]   So the CEO, Sanjay Jah, who was there,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.680]   has stepped down and a Googler.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.560]   Dennis Woodside is now the CEO, one of Dennis.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   Now maybe we can read the tea leaves about the guy who's
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.720]   running this.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.640]   He built the Google business in the Middle East Africa,
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   Eastern Europe, and Russia.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.000]   He was president of the Americas region for the last three
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.200]   years.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.040]   So he's an administrator.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.600]   He's Tim Armstrong, successor, I guess.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.920]   A committed partner to their customers.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.560]   No, I'll be an outstanding leader at Motorola.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.120]   He's an Ironman triathlete.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.240]   Oh, well, that doesn't.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.000]   I don't know.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.480]   He could do anything.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.440]   The only thing that I think might be germane
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.640]   is that he has experience in Middle East Africa, Eastern
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.360]   Europe, and Russia, which are really
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.720]   going to be growth markets for Android phones, I think.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.080]   These are areas that are dominated by Nokia
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   and ripe for the plucking, perhaps maybe China as well there.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.880]   If that's the case, that would tell me
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.480]   that Google wants to make phones.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.040]   Or maybe it's just that they want
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   to go to the existing phone manufacturers.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.840]   I don't know.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.400]   That's the real question everybody's asking.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.360]   Certainly, if your HTC Samsung LG is Motorola
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.480]   going to continue to make phones?
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.840]   And will they have special access to Google?
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.040]   And how soon can we sue?
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.240]   I mean, they have a pretty good piece on this.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.080]   What did they say?
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.960]   They did a piece of three or four possibilities
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.080]   of what Google could do with Motorola.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.440]   One of the Markstream ones would
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.240]   be to sell off the business, to keep the patents
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.160]   and sell the business.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.800]   I don't think that was the point.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.400]   Yeah, no.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.440]   I don't think that was the point.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.880]   But they're saying down the road, because I guess Motorola
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.120]   has been losing money for a while.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.760]   So it's going to be a tax write off for Google in the short term,
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.360]   then the long term.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.000]   So just run it independently, the old Googler, who's
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.560]   the new CEO, has a Motorola email address.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.280]   So it sounds like they're going to maintain a separate brand.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.240]   And another possibility-- and this
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.360]   is kind of what I'm hoping for-- is that Google's
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.080]   going to use Motorola to put out reference devices
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.560]   of the pure Google experience, phones, tablets, and Google
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.400]   TV.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.880]   Of late they've been using-- the first one was built by HTC,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.600]   the Google-- the G1.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.280]   And the Nexus was built by HTC.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.760]   And then Samsung of late.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.280]   The Nexus S, right?
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.720]   And the-- yeah.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.760]   So instead, maybe Motorola.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.600]   If they get rid of blur, nobody's going to complain.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   Ooh.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.100]   Got it.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.760]   Motorola had the least attractive customizations of Android
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.360]   and never made a pure Google phone of my knowledge.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:39.860]   Right.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.840]   I mean, I'd love to see-- I know Google works with vendors.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.080]   So I think the way this works is that vendors pitch Google
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.600]   for their ideas, what the kind of reference device should be.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.840]   And then Google chooses one.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.200]   And then they go with them.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.320]   I think that's how it's worked.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.480]   Like that's how HTC got.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.400]   So I mean, I would love to see Google work with Motorola
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.800]   or for Google to just put out the pure Google experience.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.720]   Make it perfect.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.160]   I kind of like Motorola's hardware.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.480]   The Droid Max is not bad.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.480]   That's the current Droid.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.560]   It's got good battery life.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.640]   But it's not as-- I mean, the truth is the top of the line
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.480]   Android phones right now are the Galaxy S3, which is coming
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.840]   at the end of the month.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.520]   And everybody sees it raves like crazy.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.480]   And the HTC One.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.280]   Over here in Seoul, I was dying to go by a note
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.840]   since I'm jealous of you.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.520]   I think it would be cheaper here.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.920]   It wasn't.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.640]   To match the price on Amazon, I'm going
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.480]   to do a very bad currency calculation.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.880]   It was 770,000 won.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.640]   It was what I was looking for as a price.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.160]   And they were 901 over here.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.720]   Anyway, there's this amazing place called the Technomart.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.480]   There's this huge, huge Technom place with 20,000 vendors.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.200]   I didn't get to go there.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.480]   But the Technomart, you're on this whole floor
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.560]   with intimate phones.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:52.920]   Wow.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.320]   And you do see a few more things.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.120]   The notion of the phone tablet has spread more than I knew.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.480]   HTC.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:19:59.800]   Really?
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.480]   Not just the no.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.160]   Here.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.960]   Yeah, not at all.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.200]   There's a few others.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.280]   Little slightly different squared, different shape factors.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.480]   Well, G has a square one, yeah.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.880]   But there's more variety coming.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.040]   And it's amazing in the phone world now.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.960]   Nokia owned the world for so long, Motorola owned world,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.080]   Nokia owned the world.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.840]   And now, how quickly it can just pass hands.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.720]   It's phenomenal.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.520]   Right.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.960]   It's a very high risk business.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.880]   It is, although I think Samsung is rapidly achieving
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.400]   a sentence.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.480]   Again, though, HTC is one is arguably the nicest one.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.960]   I ordered a Samsung Galaxy 3.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.440]   I S3, I couldn't resist, I have to say.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.480]   It does look really nice.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.960]   Well, Scoble saw one at Flipboard
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.560]   and said it's incredible.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.000]   It's fast, beautiful.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.560]   He says the best screen he's ever seen.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.360]   I love how little Chrome there is.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.840]   It looks really-- I'm looking at pictures of it now.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   Damn, you Leo.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.960]   He's not a good business to try to keep up and you can't,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.680]   because there's a new one every month.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.400]   It's true.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:01.880]   It's true.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.400]   And I'll probably have to retire the note,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.640]   because I'm going to use an AT&T sim.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.160]   So I guess I could use a T-Mobile sim,
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.720]   but I think it's only edge on T-Mobile.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.880]   It's just as cool as it went as I can't live with that.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.800]   And it's big.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.320]   It's big.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.400]   It's not quite as big as the note, but it's big.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.800]   4.8 inches, right?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.200]   Something like that.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.920]   So it's a little bit bigger than the Nexus.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.800]   Well, I don't know.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:30.000]   OK, so what did CNET say?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.640]   That either they could just be getting it for the patents.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.600]   Yeah, that was one of their less likely scenarios,
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.320]   but possibly.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.720]   They could leave it as it is as an independent business.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.920]   Let it go.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.360]   I don't know why they would acquire it,
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.760]   if that's what they're playing as.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.800]   They were losing money, right?
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.480]   Well, they're losing money, so that's good tax-wise for Google.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.160]   Oh, OK.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.760]   It's a write-off.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.320]   Yeah, it's a write-off.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.960]   I'll never understand.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.600]   I know.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.440]   It's too complicated for me.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.520]   Yeah, well, I'm going to make the process bottom line,
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.800]   but I don't get it either.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.320]   It doesn't make sense for an individual, right?
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.160]   Like, oh good, I'm going to lose a lot of money,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.120]   so I pay less taxes and then I don't lose quite so much money.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.960]   Or it's a showcase.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.360]   Showcase, Android showcase.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.680]   So putting out reference devices, the pure Google experience
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.120]   phones and tablets, and the Google TV, too.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.240]   That's the Motorola set-top business.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:32.000]   I wonder if the set-top business may be the MacGuffin,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.160]   maybe the real point of all of this.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.920]   Now, you've got-- now, people are raving over.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.480]   The LG TV now has Google in the TV, has Google TV,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.080]   and people are really flipping over it.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.560]   Sony just announced a new Google TV device.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.440]   Even though Logitech has not been happy,
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.400]   there seem to be plenty of takers for Google TV.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.680]   So does Google need another manufacturer to make it?
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.400]   Remember Eric Schmidt's prediction of Google TV,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.560]   six billion copies or whatever the hell he predicted?
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.120]   Was there also a rumor at one point
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.120]   that we're going to get rid of the TV piece of Motorola
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.400]   that was confounding us?
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.680]   Yeah, we haven't seen that happen.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.480]   No.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.360]   The Motorola makes these big set-top boxes,
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.880]   but I can't imagine that they're much interest at Google
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.440]   and continue to make the kinds of set-top boxes
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.160]   Motorola makes with your crap.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.200]   So maybe--
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.840]   If you suddenly-- do you create a market pressure?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   Because set-top boxes are just the world's worst computers.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.400]   Right.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   They're cheap.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.640]   Slow, horrible cheap.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:40.000]   If suddenly on the market there were a whiz-bang cable box,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.320]   then I guess there's a few questions.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.560]   One, could you create a consumer demand for that on its own?
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.920]   Would somebody-- basically, do you start buying your own cable
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   boxes?
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.840]   Does that affect the whole doxx-ist standard
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.680]   and how things operate?
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   That's interesting.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.160]   Right?
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.200]   Can I end up replacing my cable box, finally,
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.680]   with something that's really good because it is a cable box,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.760]   it will match the standards.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.080]   There is a standard on how to do this.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.240]   You can't say, no, no, no.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.640]   The idiocy of the cable company refusing
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:11.400]   to work with my DVR or other things.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.800]   Most Comcast customers, I think, have Motorola set set-top boxes.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.960]   Does this look familiar?
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   [LAUGHS]
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   Ooh.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   [LAUGHS]
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.240]   They're just terrible.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   Or this-- my current one, I just got a new one.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   It's a Motorola.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.360]   [LAUGHS]
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.680]   And not to sound too buzzwordy, but talk about right
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.160]   for disruption.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.240]   Oh, man.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.200]   Gigahertz, 200, and sports impact, too.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   This is the latest.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:41.640]   They've got DVR, HDMI, Docs is two cable modem built-in.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.440]   Docs is two is kind of obsolete, by the way.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.280]   So yeah, these just are not state-of-the-art devices.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.040]   I can't imagine Google--
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.960]   God, you've got to think that Google, these people
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.120]   love shiny stuff.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.400]   They're not going to want to keep making this.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.080]   They'll spend-- that would be an argument.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.800]   If they can't just come in-- the problem is they've got--
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.840]   I'm sure they've got millions of these out in the field.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.440]   Oh, so you just stole a base.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.040]   But that's two questions here.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.240]   One, if you had a powerful computer, finally, as your box,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.040]   what all could Google do with that?
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.880]   Imagine.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.600]   Right.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.560]   And the next question is--
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.320]   But you've got to take the cable companies
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.480]   to buy these things.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.400]   Well, that's what I'm asking.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.080]   Yeah, because the cable companies want to lease these things
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.280]   to us because they get back end times, the investment
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.600]   in the box over time.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.320]   And the executive companies that lose money
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.440]   that are wonderful to have on a cash basis--
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.880]   the amazing things happen.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.800]   But on a P&L basis, they lose money like crazy
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.200]   because they have such a huge investment in the stock,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.600]   I mean, in the physical stock.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.400]   So they would just piss off the MSOs if they drop--
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:46.880]   And they'd--
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.680]   They care.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.640]   Do they care?
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.120]   So what happens--
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   Only if you wanted to get in that business.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.200]   Well, that's one possible.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.720]   But Google comes along and just says, hey, world,
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.800]   here's a better box.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.040]   We're going to undercut the price of the market.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.320]   Screw this idea of paying $12 a month for a box.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.440]   It's a ridiculous price to your cable company.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.200]   Here, buy the world's best box.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:08.680]   Oh, oh.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.800]   For $100.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.000]   Oh, god.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.880]   I can just-- they'll just-- oh, geez.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.560]   I love the idea.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.640]   I love the idea.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.120]   I'm compelling over the--
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.480]   and of course, it's purely speculative.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.520]   We have absolutely no idea world what's going to happen.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.880]   But that's our dream scenario.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   I could see just somebody-- there's
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.440]   somebody at Google who's got acid reflux right now.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.880]   Because he's trying to figure out what the hell do we do.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.600]   Well, I mean, it's going to be either Apple or Google, right?
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.520]   And Google has a vested interest in being the first one
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:36.960]   to do it.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.600]   True.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.280]   But that's where their comals have a conflict.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.480]   Because they have an acquired a business now that
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.280]   has a huge customer base using really crappy, slow, cheap boxes.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.600]   And they'd love to move-- they'd love to move them over to Google.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.960]   Here's the beautiful thing, Leo.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:57.200]   The customer base is B2B, and Google could enable B2C.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.160]   So as Gene has said--
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.920]   I understand.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.240]   But by doing that, they're going to kill-- well, maybe they
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:02.560]   don't care.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.360]   It's a little bit more losing.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.480]   Yeah, they don't care.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.000]   Right?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.280]   And so at some point in fiduciary responsibility--
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   so the cable company is going to say, no, we refuse
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.200]   to buy a far better box for less because we want
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.320]   to keep our crappy service and control on you
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.360]   and keep strength.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.880]   Wistvaw is a good point.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.520]   In the chat room, he says, really, Google
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.640]   should have gone to the FCC and got a regulation that said,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.400]   customers have the option of buying their own set top boxes.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.960]   Because that is the case in modems.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.320]   You could buy your own cable modem.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.200]   I did.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.560]   So I got a much better one than the one that Comcast would give you.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.600]   That's a good point.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.280]   If FCC said, all right, cable companies,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.560]   you have to let customers bring their own.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.880]   I guess that's what cable card was all about.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.160]   What a cable card was--
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.800]   what a failure.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.600]   What a flop.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.400]   Because they couldn't find it.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.800]   And that's the example of--
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.040]   you can tell the cable companies what to do.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.000]   But if they don't want to do it, they can really screw with you.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.320]   Right.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   And this could be changed or something.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.880]   That's exactly what happened.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.080]   Hmm.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.480]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.320]   It's now official.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.480]   It's Gugurola or Motorola.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.440]   Motorola RUGLE.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.000]   Gugurola, Motorola RUGLE.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.920]   Gugurola.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.680]   Gugurola.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.080]   It's really a small company acquired by a big company.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.400]   It's a big company that should get pride of place.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.920]   Did you see the Google Doodle, by the way, today?
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.280]   How awesome.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:24.840]   How awesome.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.800]   There's a full synthesizer on your Google.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.360]   It's a Robert Mogg 78th birthday.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.200]   And this not only does it have all these features--
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.640]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   --but--
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.080]   This is great radio, folks.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.680]   This is great radio.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   But it also has a little tape recorder here,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.320]   so you can record your--
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.800]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.480]   OK, Leo, I'm waiting for you to have a fit that it has a G+ button on it, too.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.640]   Hey.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.600]   I can share my immortal masterpiece to Google Plus.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.240]   What's wrong with that?
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.560]   There's also a permalink button.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.080]   That's true.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.760]   You can share it however you like.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.160]   I like that.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.000]   On the Reel to Reel, on the Reebox 4-track.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.280]   So I--
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.440]   that's what I recorded, and now I can do track 2.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.920]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.520]   And now I can-- I've got a 4-track masterpiece.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.240]   Anyway.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.040]   I'm viewing source.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.520]   Is it-- what is it?
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.800]   It's JavaScript.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.960]   What is it?
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.200]   Yeah, it looks to be all--
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   It's apparently like huge.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.720]   It gives him a saying.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.240]   It just takes it when you open it up.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.520]   It takes up like another gigabyte of RAM.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.360]   It's a huge file.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.320]   It's all HTML5, CSS JavaScript.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:49.840]   No class.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.720]   It's the Google Moodle--
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.080]   Moodle Doodle.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.480]   I wonder if anybody has uploaded compositions
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.600]   from the Google Mo--
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.880]   Mo-- be fun if-- well, I guess we just
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.600]   should watch Google Plus, right?
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:08.920]   Very cool.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.440]   Yeah, I wonder if they get hashtaged if you share them.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.640]   Yeah, they should.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.960]   But who knows?
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.200]   Yeah, because I would like to see--
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.920]   I'm sure there's somebody, not me, obviously,
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.680]   but there's somebody who can use this.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.400]   Google must make four, not one, not two, but three,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.920]   but four antitrust fixes to satisfy Europe.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   Side.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.320]   I was waiting for that side.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.160]   Oh, the most returnable just had an editorial--
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.000]   and the editorals of the Wall Street Journal are--
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.680]   everything every company does are wonderful,
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.840]   but just saying that this is not consumer focused at all.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.800]   Right.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.000]   No, in fact, the commission concluded
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.480]   that Google's business practices are unfair to competitors.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.200]   And Google says, we disagree with the conclusions,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.680]   but we're happy to discuss any concerns they might have.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.200]   One, I'm not sure I disagree with any of this,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.440]   by the way, listen.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.640]   These are the four things that the commission says
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.760]   are concerns, and Google now has a week or two
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.000]   to propose how they'll address these concerns.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.200]   One, unequal treatment of third party vertical search links.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.720]   What are vertical search links?
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.920]   I think in things like travel or whatever.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.080]   Specialized search engines.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.960]   Yeah, and every time I say this, it was the journal--
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.800]   far be it for me to quote a Wall Street Journal editorial--
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.160]   but they said, that's the case.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.320]   What's wrong with that?
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.160]   So this is the case where if you search for a flight on Google,
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.520]   you'll get Google's own IAT here.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.920]   I'll search for a--
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.320]   Yeah, Google flights over Kayak, for example.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.760]   Right.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.280]   So that's unequal treatment of vertical search links.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.880]   That's concern number one.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.280]   I don't know.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.200]   I don't think-- that's what we've been saying.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.440]   Does YouTube-- and it's hard to tell.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.840]   Does YouTube show up more than it should?
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.200]   The journal says, let's stipulate that some of these charges
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.360]   may even be true, but how does it follow their bad?
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.200]   Consumers presumably benefit when their search tools provide
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.680]   more valuable information, not when there are more different
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.280]   tools to deliver that information.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.880]   Well, this is that church and state thing
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.280]   that I always bring up.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.760]   We had Matt cuts on a triangulation last week.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.120]   We talked a little bit about poor Matt.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:16.720]   I don't know why.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.440]   I always put him in that position.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.280]   But you can absolutely make the point
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.400]   that Google has the right to-- it's its business,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.000]   to do whatever it wants to promote its own properties
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.080]   from within a search.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   There's no law that says search has to return
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   ecumenical results.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.440]   Exactly.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.160]   Well, it's that free speech, the algorithm being covered
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.680]   under the algorithm is editorial,
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.840]   and it's a free speech issue.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.360]   Right.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.000]   They have the right, in other words,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.040]   to do what they want to ask you the algorithm in their favor.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.720]   But Google's never made that argument.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.120]   Like, a couple of made that argument.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.040]   But Google's always said our results are--
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:54.400]   We provide--
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.800]   Gina, that's where they shifted.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.000]   Where they had-- oh, chatroom helped
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.520]   me.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.880]   The libertarian law blogger.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.920]   We did the story last week.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.800]   Gloria and Mueller from Fospepts.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.160]   Oh, chatroom will tell me in a second.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.760]   We did the story last week where he wrote the white papers
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.320]   defending Google as--
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.760]   Oh, Vahla.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.280]   Vahla.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.520]   Right, so that's Gina.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.440]   I think that was a big shift where Google was endorsing a view
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.280]   that searches an opinion, thus searches editorial.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.640]   But it's only commissioned that paper, right?
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.160]   I mean--
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:29.680]   Right, surely.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   But they didn't write it.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.920]   But that indicates they're thinking, I think, then.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.320]   Right, so I think you're right.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.920]   They never made that editorial argument before.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   I think that you're right onto it.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.000]   That actually changed last week.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.760]   So it's funny, because Matt cuts even said, yes,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.120]   we believe we have a trust, a great trust,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.400]   of keeping search agnostic and accurate not
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.040]   to favor our own stuff.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.560]   And we endeavor to do that.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   But it's just like the New York Times.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.480]   Not just the New York Times, but it's business.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.360]   But why does the New York Times have its own reporters
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.200]   rewrite stories to get another own byline?
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.000]   They do?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.440]   Right.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.400]   Of course.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.040]   All the time.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.600]   I know they're huffing in post as that.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.880]   But that's not what I was trained to do.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.680]   Yes, you--
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.720]   Ah, there's a good story.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.800]   Let's steal it and put it on their own byline.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   No.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.600]   Oh, yeah, that's what's--
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.680]   That's plagiarism.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.200]   No, it's not, because you're rewriting it entirely.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.720]   You're taking the information which cannot be copyrightable.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.440]   And you're adding whatever value you think you're adding.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.320]   That's part of the egotistical part of this.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.600]   But every newspaper in the country--
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.320]   We'll be--
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:33.760]   I'll be all the time.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   We write.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.280]   We write.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.080]   It's like a box of clips.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.800]   Right, much better.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.120]   Well, that's all we do at Twitch.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:37.640]   So I'm not--
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.140]   Right.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.640]   Right.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.240]   I shouldn't complain.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.360]   The thing is, though, that Google's damned if they do
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.560]   or damned if they don't.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.360]   So if they're going to go this way and say that our algorithm
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.880]   is protected under free speech, that we're exercising editorial
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.240]   control over our algorithm, so that
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.480]   has correct under free speech, then things like searching for--
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.840]   I forget what story that was.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.000]   It was searching for some name.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And it suggested Jewish after it.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   That was considered and is the medical--
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.360]   They can do anything they want.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.200]   I mean--
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.960]   Then they have to take responsibility for that.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.360]   Then suddenly, they can be charged with hate speech
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.320]   if autocorrect--
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.640]   In some good phrase, yes.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.120]   You know, right?
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.840]   So either way, they're kind of screwed.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.560]   You can't have it both ways.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.160]   But this is the kind of the same analogy.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.720]   And I think this is what he wrote in that piece,
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.120]   was that this is kind of like the New York Times pretending
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.720]   to be neutral, but actually being
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.960]   run by humans who make a lot of decisions about what
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.040]   should show up in the paper and how.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.960]   And this kind of phone neutrality.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.000]   And that's what Google's sort of been doing up until now.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.560]   But it's good to ask the question.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.840]   And it's interesting to see if they really make that switch.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   And I think Jeff is right.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.200]   I think that shift is starting to happen with that paper.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.800]   Do real people care?
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.120]   Or is it just us?
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.880]   No, I don't think so.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.080]   At all.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.680]   There's one more point on this.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.160]   And I'm having a senior moment.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.520]   Gene started that earlier before we were on the show.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.040]   It can be a few old.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.240]   It's 4.30 in the morning.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.040]   You have every right to feel old.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.120]   I have ice on my knee and it's something like that.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.800]   So the band dates too.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.360]   You don't want to know.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:16.600]   So Bill Gross sold his ad company way back
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   when to Yahoo, what was it called?
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.440]   Oh, I don't remember.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.080]   The original ad company.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.400]   Overture.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:22.840]   Overture.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.120]   Thank you.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:23.880]   OK.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   So remember what Overture was?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.800]   Overture said you could pay for position.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.840]   Right.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.280]   Right.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.080]   And Google came along and said, no,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.640]   that's not a very good experience.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.760]   We're not going to do that.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   Right.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.080]   But as a precedent, as an ethic or a standard in the industry,
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.600]   paying for position was the way the industry worked.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.480]   Right.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.200]   And Google--
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.880]   Google, I really believe Google was almost started
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.720]   in response to that.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   And certainly, the do--
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.600]   don't be evil that Paul Boohite suggested
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.880]   as the company mantra was exactly in response to that.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.640]   Danny Sullivan said--
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   Right.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.880]   So now you can look at that two ways.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.400]   Right.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.400]   You can look at that one way and say, well, it is evil
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.400]   for Google, for its own stuff.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.960]   And I would argue that's the-- that's
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.320]   what every media company does.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.480]   But you could also argue it the other way and say, well,
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.600]   Google's still way better than that.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.280]   But Google--
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:11.800]   But Google--
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.160]   This is your point, Gina.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.600]   I think is well taken.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.840]   Google has to decide, are they a media company?
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.640]   Yes.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.000]   Or are they a somehow agnostic search company?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.800]   They can't have it both ways.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.240]   And they have-- because there's different rules.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.360]   And they can't say, well, sometimes--
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.320]   it's, well, no, we're above the fray--
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.040]   in order to preserve their safe harbor and other times.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:34.440]   No, no.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.920]   We get the right to say whatever we want.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.360]   First Amendment, in order to put advertising
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.000]   in their results.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.480]   And you can't have it both ways because there's
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.800]   different rules.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.160]   Pick the way you're going to be.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.600]   And to your question, I don't think people really care
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.040]   because people trust the Google brand.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.680]   But the minute that people start to not trust the Google
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.520]   brand, they are going to care.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.560]   Well, they may not even care.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.880]   They may not know overtly.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.840]   It could happen just because they go, well, these results,
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.560]   you know, I don't know.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.600]   I don't like this anymore.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.000]   I'm going to go try Bing.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.400]   Well, right.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   Exactly.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.120]   You were exactly right.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.280]   It would manifest itself more like that.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.360]   That's how it would be.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.160]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.480]   Number two from the European Commission, concern number two,
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   this would be a concern.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.720]   Copying content from virtual search engines, or vertical search
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.280]   engines.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.640]   They think they're copying stuff from like restaurant reviews
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.200]   from third party websites without authorization.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.040]   Now, remember Yelp complained.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.040]   That's exactly what Google was doing.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.520]   So Google stopped as soon as Yelp complained.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.520]   Because I mean, they index the content.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:38.720]   Right.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.080]   Well, there's a big danger there is that, yeah, they
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.400]   copy the content of the entire net in the sense of being
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.200]   able to index it and being able to analyze it.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.720]   Now, do they present what they copy?
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.200]   Well, yeah, they do in search engines.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.800]   You know, how much of--
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.760]   That's the nature of search.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   What's fair use?
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.240]   That's the business they're in.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.120]   But that's why if you're a search engineer,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.440]   you can't be a media company.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.640]   Because that confuses the issue.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.200]   That's my point.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.840]   If you're a search company, then you
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.680]   are off the hook for copying.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.560]   Because that's what you do.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.480]   As a search company, you put excerpts from search results.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.800]   Well, I mean, that's not--
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   I mean, if you run a blog, if you run a media site,
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.720]   you quote an excerpt from another article.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.560]   That's not copying.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.280]   That's fair use.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.400]   That's commentary.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.440]   And so the excerpts in Google's search results
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.640]   are a certain language.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.080]   Well, I would only complain if I'm
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.480]   Yelp if nobody ever went to the search result, but just said,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.520]   oh, I got what I wanted right here on the Google page.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.560]   Then you got a problem, right?
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.040]   Right.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.480]   Because Google's stealing traffic.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.840]   I met somebody here in Seoul, and I
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.320]   don't think I'm revealing anything,
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.480]   instead of doing some work with Google on fair use,
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.440]   instead of it's a huge issue around the world.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.240]   Listen to how we were talking about fair use
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.560]   before in the Android case.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.760]   Now fair use here.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.960]   Fair use in the US.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.240]   And US has a fair use doctrine that
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.120]   isn't the case around the world.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.760]   And even so, fair use can confounds people
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.080]   because there's no definition of what fair use is on purpose.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.880]   Because fair use is different by context.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.160]   So this whole notion of Google--
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.680]   that Google resting on fair use
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   is a critical, critical strategic necessity for them.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.320]   I mean, here we are, Twits Media Company,
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.120]   and we're talking about excerpts of the information
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.080]   week's article about the antitrust fixes
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   that Google has to make.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.200]   And you're right.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.280]   And we should-- and we think we will put a link
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.760]   to that full article so people can
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.280]   go away from it.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:29.780]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.600]   And you know what I should do.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.800]   And I don't do this always.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.960]   And I should do this as quote, say, oh, this
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.760]   is from an article written by Thomas Clayburne
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.080]   in Information Week.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.200]   But we will-- you know, we show it,
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.280]   and we put that in the show notes.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.920]   But I should actually-- I tried it in the--
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.920]   But even--
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.240]   Right.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.360]   But even then, all Thomas is doing--
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.160]   He's just--
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.600]   He's just recapitulating--
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.120]   He's just fine.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.880]   That's what journalists do.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.520]   But there's no great holy writ in that.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.200]   They're summarizing something that we can link to directly now.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:56.640]   Right.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.320]   And it's a service.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.120]   Thank you very much.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.200]   It's great to do it.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.240]   Smart stuff.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.640]   But--
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.400]   You know, is that some kind of--
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.400]   Oh, stand this.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.000]   Holy fleece, only that thing.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.200]   I don't know what that means.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.560]   Holy fleece.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.680]   I don't know what that means.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.840]   Holy fleece, man.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.800]   Holy fleece, man.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.200]   There's like a term of law called holy fleece.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.400]   No, no, it was holy grail and finding the fleece.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.400]   Oh, there is the Church of the Holy Fleece,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.880]   the Order of the Holy Fleece.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.840]   That's just punchy.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.480]   That's it.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.760]   Charles the 5th of 1556 was dressed entirely in black,
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:38.080]   except for the red collar of the Order of the Holy Fleece.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.280]   Holy fleece.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.840]   Holy fleece.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.480]   You have to be wearing a twit fleece, when you say--
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:42.840]   So wait a minute.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.760]   So there's the holy grail and there's the holy fleece.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.320]   I had no idea.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   Well, you brought it up.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:52.840]   What?
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.880]   Fleece deprivation.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.040]   This wraps this cross.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:55.960]   Holy fleece.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.200]   I like it.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.120]   Is that because the moths got to it?
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.000]   Search item three of the four.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.320]   We got to get right through this here.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.360]   The Search Agreements with Partners.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.040]   Commission says that Google is asking for exclusivity
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.920]   when you put ads sense on your--
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.720]   you can't display ads that might be confused with Google Ads
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.920]   on your website.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.160]   You cannot use another site search service
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   and you can't display, quote, any non-Google content
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.840]   targeted advertising.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.440]   So that's the one that does hit most to a potential
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.560]   monopoly issue.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.040]   Because monopoly, I argue, the Google
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.080]   has is not in search at all.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.600]   Other kinds of choices.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.960]   The market gives them a penetration.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.120]   It gives them where Google does have power of God
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:40.960]   as an advertising.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.840]   Boy, that's interesting.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.720]   If I put ads sense on my website,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.560]   I can't put anybody else's ads on there.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.360]   I don't think for you, Leo, they care, no offense.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.800]   I think that those are for big corporate deals.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.440]   But I mean, if you agree--
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.760]   I mean, those are ad sense's terms.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.160]   You don't have to--
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.840]   That's exactly right, Cheena.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.000]   And so if you look at, let's say, Google's deal with about.com.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.800]   You bet your bippy that Google puts those conditions on,
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.400]   because Google gave about.com guarantees.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.200]   And Google gave them--
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.720]   it was a negotiation.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.880]   So what does Google get out of the negotiation?
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.960]   Google says, OK, we'll give you a good deal,
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   but we're the one in town.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.160]   And about.com says, $50 million a year?
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.400]   OK, you can be.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.080]   I bet that that's similar in other ad sets.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.120]   Finally, ad--
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.000]   Well, here's the other thing.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.440]   There's category exclusivity, too.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.800]   An advertiser will sell and say, OK, I'm only
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.720]   going to use GM for this category,
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.160]   and that's I won't sell to Ford, which limits you greatly.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.840]   But that's negotiation.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.920]   Finally, they say, Google prevents people
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.640]   from moving their AdWords campaigns
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.840]   to other non-Google ad services.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.960]   If you quote, if you run your own advertising network
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.720]   and the AdWords API client offers functionality,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.440]   the copies data between Google and your advertising network,
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.400]   then you must ensure the end users must manually
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.640]   select AdWords campaigns or campaigns
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.440]   that were for copying so they may optimize
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.400]   in prior to each instance of import
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.360]   into or export from that network.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.600]   In other words, you can't automate this copy.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.760]   Who else offers such portability?
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.080]   Now, I wouldn't be surprised if Google brings
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.720]   the data liberation front to ads, that's fine.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.840]   But I can't imagine anyone.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.960]   Again, I don't know what I'm talking about here.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.200]   You're right, though.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.280]   That seems a lot to ask.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.440]   This is Europe, like going out for--
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.480]   what fast these people, the story is,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.440]   is that I think Europe knows they have--
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.200]   EU has the case because they're--
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.400]   before they even decide to drag Google to the mother,
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.920]   say, OK, if you just do these four things, you're clear.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.840]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.760]   That's how we ask.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.840]   It's not going to happen.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.280]   Yeah, but Google's not going to do it.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:51.000]   I think Google should be hanging tough.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.880]   Maybe Google will come back and say, OK, we'll do maybe a third
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.600]   of maybe two of these.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.480]   How does that work?
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.600]   That's what's happening, right?
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.640]   This is a negotiation.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.600]   Negotiation.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.080]   So the EC says, do this.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:07.360]   And it's just a letter to Eric Schmidt.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.080]   Would you mind these four things kind of bug us?
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.000]   And Eric said, well, I'll do two, exactly.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.520]   I'll do two.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.680]   And I'll get cut you some slack on the third or something.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.200]   Right.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.880]   The EC said, Google has a matter of weeks
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.920]   to propose remedies to the four concerns
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.480]   or face formal proceedings that could end in a fine or remedies
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.800]   imposed by European regulators.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.120]   Google says, it disagrees with the allocations.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.320]   Competition is already increasing in the search market.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.640]   We've only just started to look through the commission's
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.080]   arguments.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.040]   Google told ours, technical.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.360]   We disagree with the conclusions,
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.080]   but we're happy to discuss any concerns I might have.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.160]   Competition on the web has increased dramatically
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.240]   in the last two years since the--
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.600]   they're so far behind.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:56.880]   I love the skill that it is to write a grin-effing
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.480]   response to things.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.280]   We respectfully submit to the European Commission two
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.360]   letters, F and U.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:13.280]   Here is our offer.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.160]   Google says, the competitive pressures facing
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.440]   Google are tremendous.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.760]   Sounds like they got a headache.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.360]   We got pressure.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.040]   Innovation online has never been greater.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:30.720]   But Google's net share of the desktop search market is down.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.480]   Yeah, the A searches yesterday as war.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.080]   So just take that, E.U.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.000]   And E.U.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.600]   The irony is one of the other stories in there
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.880]   is the Chrome surpasses, IE.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.840]   Microsoft, owning IE, was supposedly
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.080]   going to ruin the whole world.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   Right, right.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.280]   Google was the next one in to fight that.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.480]   And now Google's going to own the whole world,
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.080]   but then Facebook comes in and it's going to own that.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.640]   And somebody else is going to be coming in.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.760]   That's the new world, folks.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.520]   It just stuff moves way too fast for governments,
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.920]   which are built, at least in the U.S.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.840]   to work slowly because the founders didn't trust speedy
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.920]   government.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.240]   And what's happening, it's just going to get faster and faster
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.600]   to produce some government.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.320]   It's such an impedance mismatch now.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.800]   It's not going to be ever, ever again, anywhere.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.680]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.040]   Gina and Jeff are here.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.240]   We're talking about Google.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.440]   We've got to talk about the Facebook IPO.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.800]   That's turning out to be just a mess.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   The issues, not me, it sounds like people got ripped off.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.160]   Then there's a great quote from a business insider
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:44.080]   that talked to a hedge fund manager on the Facebook IPO
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.520]   and what went wrong.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:52.480]   And the anonymous hedge fund manager said that basically,
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.440]   he said, well, we're mad because we
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.520]   thought we were going to get a lot of money off of Muppets.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.760]   That's what they call us little normal investors.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.680]   We thought the Muppets were going to get suckered,
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.520]   and they didn't.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.160]   And so we're mad.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.880]   You Muppets didn't fall for it.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.520]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.960]   Right now, I want to talk about Ford
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.280]   and the Ford electric vehicles.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.080]   So great.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.720]   The 2012 focus is here.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:22.240]   The electric focus at your EV certified Ford dealer.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.160]   Oh, man.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.640]   You know, some people were complaining.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.800]   I remember this.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.080]   A couple of companies already had their electric vehicles
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.760]   Chevy and Nissan and so forth.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.920]   And everybody's saying, where's Ford?
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:31.360]   Where's Ford?
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.680]   And I remember talking to Alan.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.080]   I said, where's Ford?
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.960]   I said, they're saying, where's Ford?
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.840]   And he said, we wanted to really do it right.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.760]   We did not want to rush into this.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.280]   We wanted to make the right electric vehicles.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.240]   We wanted to make sure that we could make it across the line,
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.720]   not just a token electric vehicle.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.520]   And they did it.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.240]   The 2012 Ford focus is--
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.040]   I mean, they're using state-of-the-art batteries
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.560]   to give it the most fuel-efficient five-passenger
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.840]   vehicle in America.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:02.440]   The best city rating in its class, 110 miles per gallon E.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.920]   That's the new equivalent for electric vehicles, MBGE.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.160]   110.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:12.040]   It has the best in-class driving range of 76 miles.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.480]   That's good.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:13.960]   That's good.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.360]   I mean, we would drive across country on this,
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.400]   but I have another choice for you if you're going to do that.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.040]   But forgetting around town, that's plenty.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.600]   And it charges up in three to four hours.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.120]   That's the best in class 240-volt charge time.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.680]   You, of course, have to get the 240-volt optional 240-volt home
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.160]   charging station for that.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.120]   But that's like half the time the leaf takes.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.280]   That's really fast.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.040]   The 2012 Ford Focus Electric, it's available now.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.680]   And they've updated so much that, well, it
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.880]   uses regenerative braking so that, in fact, they
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.400]   were able to capture more than 90% of the energy that
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.360]   would be lost in a braking system and put it back
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:49.920]   in the battery.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.040]   That's one of the ways they get this range so high,
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.960]   and this efficiency so high.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.400]   The Sync and My4 Touch have been updated to an EV status.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.080]   So they do things like monitor the battery state
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.360]   of charge, maximize energy efficiency,
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   let you control the vehicle charge and preconditioning settings,
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.160]   find the most eco-friendly route, all of that stuff.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.320]   Built-in, in fact, they even have smartphone apps that
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.720]   do that, including a value charging feature
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.240]   power by Microsoft that is basically one button push
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.680]   to take advantage of off-peak and reduce rate utility hours.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.960]   All of that built-in automatically.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.440]   Take a look at, said, this is the website,
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:34.440]   4.com/technology, 4.com/itslittlethings.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   It's little things like the light on the where you plug in,
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.440]   that shows you how far the charge is.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.920]   It's all so nice.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:43.720]   See that?
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.760]   It goes around, and it shows you.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.440]   It shows you.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.240]   You always know when your car is fully charged and ready to go,
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.760]   because it lights up like that.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.400]   Isn't it fun to plug your car in?
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.520]   Now, if you are going to drive a cross-country,
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.800]   then you might want to take a look at the Ford Fusion
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.200]   Energy.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.600]   That's going to be available early next year.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.400]   That's a plug-in hybrid.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.960]   I think this is the one I'm going to get.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.440]   So the idea is you've got a gas engine and a plug-in.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.720]   You use gas when you use electricity when you need it.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.200]   You get 100 miles per gallon, E, 100 MPGE.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.800]   This is going to be very cool.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.480]   This is the Energy 2013 Ford Fusion Energy.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.240]   They say it'll be available early in 2013.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.000]   Really cool stuff.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.680]   Visit the website, Ford.com/technology,
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:39.720]   and go to your EV Certified Ford dealer and drive one today.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.200]   Scott Mottie posted a great-- let me
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.000]   say I can find a great picture of--
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.800]   they did this yesterday.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   The Ford employees got together on the campus,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.200]   and they made a blue oval.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.800]   Let me see if Scott's got this on his Pinterest.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   He Pinterest did it, I thought.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.160]   I can't find it.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.160]   Anyway, it's pretty cool.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.160]   Scott's awesome.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.760]   OK, let's move on.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.360]   Let's move on.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.200]   Next story, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.560]   Larry Page says Facebook is holding users hostage.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:22.520]   He told Charlie Rose how unfortunate it is that Facebook
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.080]   has been closed with the data.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.240]   He says, I think we would--
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.400]   certainly, we're in the business of searching data.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.080]   They would like to see that data.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.640]   Oh, yes, they would.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.640]   They would like to see that.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.240]   I think the idea that you'd hold your users hostage kind
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.640]   of in the absence of reasons for it
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.720]   doesn't make sense.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.960]   There's reasons.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.400]   And Larry, there's reasons.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.280]   From a user's perspective page said, oh, it's great.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.640]   I'm joining Facebook.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.920]   I want my contacts.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.600]   In Google, we said fine.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.840]   He says you know a lot.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.360]   You can get them from Google.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.280]   And the issue we had is then the Facebook said, new Google.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.080]   You cannot do the reverse.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.880]   This is when they let you use your Google contacts
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:14.440]   when you sign up to Facebook, but not by C versus C.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.960]   He says users don't understand what they're doing.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.880]   They're putting data in and they don't understand.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.160]   You can't take it out.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.000]   So we said we'll only participate with people
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.200]   who have reciprocity and we're still waiting.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.000]   This is going to be a shooting war.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.360]   You keep talking like that, Larry.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:35.400]   Google versus Facebook.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.560]   Any thoughts?
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.360]   Yeah, I was looking at a place on Facebook
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.160]   and I clicked on the address and it launched Bing Maps.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.640]   I mean, obviously Facebook and Microsoft and Yahoo
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.720]   have figured out ways to work with one another
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.520]   and Google's just out.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.960]   Let's talk about the do not track.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.320]   Since we-- I don't want Jeff to fall asleep.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.800]   Steve Gibson just reviewed this on security now.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.360]   And he says Twitter's doing everything right.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.640]   So you know there's do not track in the browsers now.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.920]   Firefox, internet explorer, and Safari.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.920]   Not in Chrome.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.760]   Not in Chrome.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.040]   Not in Chrome.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:23.640]   There are extensions, of course, but not in Chrome.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:28.680]   Do not track is a simple way for users to--
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:33.240]   you check the box in your browser to tell a web service
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   that you don't want information about their visits
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.760]   collected across websites.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.120]   Keep the data where it is.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.520]   Not share it with other sites.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:49.000]   Do not track me across the internet.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.560]   So Twitter has announced they're going to do this new thing,
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.440]   which I think is kind of cool.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.400]   I'm actually curious what you guys think.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.600]   Twitter is going to track you across the net
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.160]   wherever there's a Twitter share button, which is a lot of sites.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.080]   Kind of like the Facebook like button.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.880]   And then based on the sites you visit,
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.640]   this is the only thing Twitter is going to do.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.560]   They're going to suggest other Twitter user accounts to you.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.000]   Saying, well, you hang out at Starbucks a lot,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.320]   you should probably follow Starbucks.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:20.040]   And here it is in your suggested user list, customized.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.280]   I think that that's probably a good use for it.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.240]   It's also a trivial use.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.120]   And like, should they be following us around
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.360]   just so they can suggest better users?
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.720]   Well, oh, but--
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   OK.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.880]   Oh, they be following us around.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.040]   They're following us.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.920]   They're not following us around, right?
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.920]   Like, the widget is embedded in these other pages.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:43.120]   So if I read an article that Leo's written,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.960]   and there's a follow Leo button on the article,
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.200]   and I do that 10 times in a week,
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.280]   and then I go back to Twitter, it says, hey,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   maybe you should follow Leo, because you seem interested
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.360]   in his stuff.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.600]   Like, that's not following.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.760]   Those widgets are there anyway.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.360]   They're just saying that they're using that data.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.760]   That's paying attention to the signals you're giving them.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.280]   Right.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.760]   That's paying attention to the referrals.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   Yes.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.560]   I mean, well, Twitter's been doing some really very good things
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.760]   lately, like it's patent stuff and all that.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.200]   But this is slightly disingenuous, I think.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.640]   It has an impact on the debate.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.720]   Well, they've been--
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.800]   to finish the thought, they've been very clear
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.720]   that if you have-- do not track--
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.360]   track in your browser turned on, they won't do it.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.160]   They'll respect it.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:20.840]   Here's the point, Leo.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.720]   They never attract you, because they didn't have any business
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.320]   reason to do so.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.760]   Because Twitter has no business model and no ads.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.000]   It's not-- so in fact, the Twitter doesn't--
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.520]   it's like saying that Ford's cars aren't going to attract you.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.880]   Well, they never did.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.080]   Right.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:36.840]   Why should they?
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:41.480]   Well, here's-- so now if you go to your settings on the Twitter--
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.680]   let me do that.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:50.040]   You'll see that there is a button that says, do not track me.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.200]   Well, actually, it's the other way around.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.520]   Sorry.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.880]   Personalization-- Taylor Twitter based on my recent website
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.840]   visits.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.320]   But then-- and I think this is to their credit--
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.680]   preview suggestions tailored for you, not currently
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.440]   available to all users.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.680]   And learn more about how this works
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.240]   and your additional privacy.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.520]   Yeah, but Leo wasn't here.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.000]   It was for the press release.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.280]   And the press release says, oh, we're
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.120]   wonderful, we're Twitter.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:12.800]   We don't track you.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.920]   Twitter never had to track.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.080]   And it has no reason to track.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.720]   And so they basically created a new feature
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.440]   so you can turn it off so they can say it.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.120]   And the problem I have with that is it affects the debate.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:21.280]   Right.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.320]   It says, oh, well, good.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.360]   Somebody's not tracking me.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.560]   Everybody else who is is evil.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:25.880]   And we're back into that again.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:29.760]   Yeah, because now everybody who says, oh, well, how interesting.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.080]   Because Facebook doesn't say they support do not track.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.120]   And those like buttons are everywhere.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.680]   What's Facebook doing with those?
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.720]   Gina said they're, like, shortly thinking,
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.440]   ah, well, what about this morning?
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:47.520]   So you're saying it's disingenuous that the Twitter
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.560]   is really using this to take a pot shot at Google and Facebook.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.200]   Yes.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:51.920]   Yes.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.440]   Clever.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.440]   Yeah, I mean, but that's how services
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.960]   sort of differentiate themselves.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.040]   I mean, DuckDuck goes, whole business model,
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.440]   is like, we don't keep your search terms.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.960]   I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.800]   Look, the do not track is a feature.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.120]   And that's the name of the feature.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.600]   Twitter is not calling it tracking.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   I mean, that's the name of the feature in the browser.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.960]   And I feel like it's akin to saying, I'm a search engine
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.640]   and I'm going to respect your robots.txt.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.200]   If your robots.txt says that we should index your stuff,
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.280]   then we won't.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.120]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:23.400]   Look, the reality is a very small percentage of users
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.560]   are actually going to turn on, do not track in their browser,
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.600]   and then go to the settings and Twitter and turn it on.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.400]   And yeah, of course, it's a PR move.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.040]   It definitely is.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.560]   They're trying to differentiate themselves and say, hey,
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.160]   we're respecting this browser feature.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.360]   And the implication is these other guys aren't.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.840]   I don't know if that's a bad thing, though.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.800]   I mean, for the people who do care about this stuff,
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.520]   it seemed like--
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.280]   But they basically turn on a new feature
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.960]   just so you could turn it off so that they come up
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.200]   with a press release for doing so.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.240]   And thus put pressure on their ads supported competitors
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:56.440]   and not act very collegial in the whole internet thing.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.600]   So OK, so you feel like it's--
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.120]   they're undermining--
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.640]   He says it's very cynical.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   It's so cynical.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.080]   He's just monol.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.040]   He's saying it's completely cynical.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:05.400]   Yes.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.240]   OK.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.560]   OK.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.480]   They would never have considered turning this on,
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.320]   except that they can zing Facebook and Google by doing so.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.600]   Yeah, listen, I'm not trying to be anti-Twitter.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.560]   And I was at first suspicious when
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:25.760]   they did their international revealing
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.000]   when they were forced to take down tweets by governments.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.640]   And I thought that was first bad move.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.320]   I was wrong.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.840]   It was actually a better move.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.720]   So I could be wrong about this.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.760]   But yeah, I see it as highly cynical.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.000]   And ironic, what it also points out
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.320]   is once again, the put a wrench on with this bottle.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:42.820]   Right.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:47.240]   The reason to track is because you're going to serve freaking ads.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.960]   Well, they've closed that door.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.160]   They do have sponsored posts.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.360]   Are they not sponsored posts?
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.000]   Yeah, but they don't use tracking for them.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.600]   They don't use tracking to do it.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.520]   It's just random, whatever you get.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.520]   That's the problem.
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.440]   It's a very clumsy advertising structure.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.440]   Let me go to this one.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.640]   They wish they had a reason to track you.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.600]   Oh, they so wish they had a reason to track you.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.440]   But since they don't, let's make a virtue.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.640]   They don't let the hell of a shirt off.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.440]   Right, exactly.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.640]   The second problem is this whole third party other sites
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.080]   thing, if you believe as I do that content is going
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.280]   to become more embeddable all around the net.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:20.780]   Right.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.320]   That everything becomes more like a YouTube video
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.840]   than this idea of going site this.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.360]   Oh my god, they're going site to site to site.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.000]   Well, so will the content.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.320]   And the content should travel with analytics.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.600]   If a YouTube video is embedded on my blog,
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.640]   I can't very well say to YouTube, oh, but you can't check out
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.920]   who's looking at it.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.160]   Right, exactly.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.840]   So that architecturally where the net is going,
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.800]   where the web is going, I think,
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   is to enable more of that kind of embedding.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.840]   That's part of what Twitter is part of.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.680]   But now they're kind of saying, oh, well, no, no,
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.400]   if it goes across sites, we won't do it.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.480]   Well, that's really interesting point of view.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.200]   It's really--
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.320]   I feel like Twitter knows so much about me, though.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.440]   I mean, five years, 6,000 tweets, they've got data
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.320]   on how many times I've clicked on links.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.040]   They've got-- they know a lot about stuff
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.160]   that I like home friends with, my political views.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.480]   But they can advertise to me using the information that I--
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.320]   But they can't because--
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.200]   They can't really enter into Twitter.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   Well, if you use the Twitter page, you could.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.040]   But I don't.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   If you use a Twitter client, which is what
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.720]   spread Twitter in the first place,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:30.360]   if they started pumping in ads too much of that on that basis,
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.520]   you'd be able to be having a fit.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.520]   Hmm.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520]   Hmm.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.520]   Right.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.520]   Right.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.120]   I like the idea that it's a cynical manipulation
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.280]   of the media.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.080]   I don't know how sophisticated they are if it is.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   I like that idea.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]   What?
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.480]   I think you're giving them a lot of credit.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.080]   I think they might deserve it.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:49.920]   You're right.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   They have no reason to track.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.480]   So-- oh, we're going to come up with some focacca feature
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.520]   just so we can tell you we don't track if you don't want us to.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.800]   We will, if you would like, a better suggested user list.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.720]   I mean, it seems like Twitter is positioning themselves
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.960]   to cater to the sort of more tech savvy audience,
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.880]   or the kind of-- between the patent stuff and my--
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.360]   Bootstrap and the MySQL modifications they released.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.520]   They're really-- they're pretty active in the open source
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.760]   world and the world of advanced users, the kind of users that
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.920]   might check off, do not track.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.360]   Maybe Jeff is right.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.400]   Maybe it's a PR move.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.520]   Maybe it's a hostile PR move that's
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.200]   going to take down the advertising.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.160]   This is small for the rest of the internet.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.200]   And how could they--
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.080]   Well, that's too late because that horse is sale because--
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.400]   if horses could sale, that horse would have sailed.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.400]   Because--
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.360]   It was sale in search of the-- of the fleece.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.560]   Of the golden fleece.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560]   Of the holy fleece.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560]   The holy fleece.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.240]   That horse says sale in search of the holy fleece.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.760]   Because already it's going to be in the browsers, right?
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.240]   So the-- the people who are fall here,
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.160]   Jeff, really, they want you to be angry at Firefox Safari.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.000]   Yes, I am.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:04.520]   I am.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.240]   Because those are the guys who created this whole notion.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.920]   It's the support of media.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.200]   And, you know, I'm trying to be because,
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.600]   "Peritorial, the reason that the Wall Street Journal goes
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.920]   after this is because they are abandoning the ad market
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.880]   and favor of a paid market corporately, news corpus."
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.440]   I'm not suggesting that that's--
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.480]   you know, it permeates every decision made there.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.600]   But I think that's an impact.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.560]   So those that are supported by advertising, which to me
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.960]   is going to be the key in media and journalism,
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.680]   the more it gets hurt, the more problems we have.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.640]   Now, once again, I will always say in this case
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.120]   that the advertising and media industries did a terrible job
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.560]   of informing people what they were doing,
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.320]   why they were doing, what benefits came out of it,
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.640]   why it was necessary.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.280]   And so they've made this dead.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.680]   I agree with that.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.280]   But the emotional reaction to this of the tracking--
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.600]   and, you know, you're right, Twitter didn't
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.480]   make up the word tracking, but it still plays into that game.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.440]   And then uploading those so that you would get the data.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.760]   Right now, something's going on at the Google+
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.840]   photographers conference.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.440]   We're going to keep an eye on it.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.680]   Max Braun from Project Glass is about to take the stage
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.880]   to show pictures they've taken with the Google Glasses.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.680]   So that's coming up a little later on.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.280]   If you're on Google+, you could see it just go to the Project
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.240]   Glass.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.560]   So Google's hosting the photographers event?
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.400]   I missed that one.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.120]   It's a Scott Kelby event for Google+.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.000]   And photographers, it's the gplusc.com, the Google+--
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.920]   It's officially endorsed by Google.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.360]   That's an interesting question.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360]   Is Google certainly there?
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.480]   Oh, it's cool.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.680]   It's a Scott Kelby.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.880]   You know, Kelby training's doing it.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.480]   And actually, Catherine Hall, one of our Twitter hosts,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.280]   our Twitter photo host is there doing a photo walk and so forth.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280]   But I'm curious.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.800]   I will watch the stream and see if they
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.200]   show any interesting pictures from G+.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.200]   I'm sorry, from Project Glass.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   I almost misread this article that
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.800]   says that Android smells like Axe.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:17.520]   That article is my fault.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.240]   I think it was ReadWriteWeb did an article
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.560]   on why the iPhone success has women to thank.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.920]   And there's just a subheading, which I just couldn't resist.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.480]   It was the axe-like scent of Android's doodum.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.080]   And that's a reference to Axe body spray.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.240]   Which only guys like, women do not like it.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.920]   Which only guys like, right.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.080]   But they'd have you believe that women liked it.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.200]   Yeah, guys think women like it.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:41.960]   Right, right.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.760]   Anyway, this isn't anything we haven't discussed before,
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.000]   just about how so many of the Android ads, especially
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:48.160]   the--
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.600]   The Droid ads are so much.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.920]   --very much geared toward them.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   They're very, very mask-y.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.360]   And now, T-Mobile, which had kind of this youthful little--
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.200]   first, they had Catherine Zeta-Jones,
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.680]   which I don't know why they changed.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.160]   But then they got Carly, who's a young Catherine.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.600]   And now, she's like riding Harleys and stuff like crazy.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.400]   Right, she went from the pink dress to the motorcycle.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.120]   Magenta motorcycle and skin-tight leather.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.880]   She's basically the go-daddy girl.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.080]   Well, not as bad.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.040]   Not as bad as that, but--
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.640]   The slogan is, no more Mr. Nice Girl.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.800]   So do you think-- I mean, Gina, you're a woman.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:27.280]   Do you think that Android appeals to men and iPhone?
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.480]   Is it-- is I from Mars and--
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.160]   or from Venus and the Android from Mars?
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:32.880]   What is it?
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:36.960]   If you're judging purely from ad campaigns, definitely.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.200]   I mean, most of the Android ad campaigns
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:44.840]   are like robots and explosions and robot arms using the phone.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.840]   Whereas the iPhone ads are like regular people.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.280]   I mean, granted, the-- is it rain?
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.520]   Like, those ads drive me crazy.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.480]   But they're still--
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.280]   But who is--
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.920]   --they're flat and lit regular people,
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.200]   beautiful children smiling on the beach.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.080]   It's much more of a family-oriented, everyday life
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.080]   kind of take on things.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.480]   Like, this one's going to make your life better.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.040]   The Android message always seems to be with the people
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.000]   who want more power.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.320]   Want to do more.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.240]   Droid does.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:12.800]   You want to do more.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.360]   They focused on power.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.920]   Yeah, they focused absolutely on power.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.840]   And I think that that's pretty clear.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.640]   I think the Zoe Deschanel ads for Siri
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.000]   are aimed at guys, though, right?
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   Well--
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   Who are they aimed at?
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.320]   I would say probably both.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.480]   Yeah, because it's--
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.320]   Yeah, Siri is--
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.560]   Sam Jackson is making risotto with organic mushrooms.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.320]   I mean, that's pretty--
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.320]   Maybe that is an aim, guys.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:37.840]   --natural sexual.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.440]   And Zoe Deschanel, I think, has appealed to both.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.400]   I mean, women want to be here.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.800]   Have you seen the parody?
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.160]   Have you seen the parody?
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:45.680]   No.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.160]   Here, this is Lindsey Doolin from Coachella, Kilciella.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.320]   Sky crying.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.960]   I do not understand.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.600]   All she talks.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.640]   Fine, nearest, banjo store.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.040]   Is this the close up where I look around all quirky
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.200]   with my bangs?
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.200]   No, that's me.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   [LAUGHING]
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.520]   We're good with the singing.

[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520]   Siri, explain my song.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.880]   If you've seen the Siri ads--

[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.480]   Oh, match my bangs.

[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.000]   Are you ready?
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.840]   Siri, is my album going to go platinum?
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:28.840]   Can I have a buzzer again?
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.400]   She thinks it's a magic eight ball.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.640]   She's shaking it.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.480]   One time I've burped a cloud.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.480]   [LAUGHING]

[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.120]   OK.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.720]   I'm feeling like Indonesian food.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.560]   And this is my magic.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.400]   [LAUGHING]
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.600]   Is this a shot where you get my bangs?
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.760]   It's so great.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   [LAUGHING]
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.800]   It's so great.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.280]   Only if you've seen the originals, but yeah.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:54.760]   OK.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.280]   I don't know.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.080]   I think you can make the argument
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.480]   that dancing around your dirty house and your pajamas
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.960]   on a rainy Saturday in ordering tomato soup appeals to women.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.880]   I think you're right.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.600]   I don't know who it appeals to.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.360]   But yeah, I think you're right.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.920]   She's just so cute.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.720]   She's adorable.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.760]   She's adorable.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.360]   Let's just play a couple of those just so that you--
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.760]   for fair--
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.760]   Yes.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.520]   It appears to be raining.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.120]   Oh.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.080]   Let's get tomato soup delivered.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.200]   I found a number of restaurants whose reviews
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.920]   mentioned tomato soup and that deliver.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.920]   Good.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.680]   Because I don't want to put on real shoes.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.800]   I don't know which is funny.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.960]   You're the real one.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.040]   Or the parody.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.640]   They're both equally dumb.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.040]   I mean, the fact that she's staring out the window at pouring rain
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:37.600]   and does not--
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.080]   Is it raining?
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.080]   --that rain?
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.480]   [LAUGHING]
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.320]   It's ridiculous.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.800]   Is the sky crying?
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.800]   [LAUGHING]
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.800]   [LAUGHING]
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.400]   Google.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.680]   So anyway, I had to drop that story into the--
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.920]   I love it.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.000]   --and the acts like sense of Android--
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.240]   I miss red acts.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.800]   But now that I know it was acts, I feel better.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.960]   The dude dumb.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.880]   I can't remember who this was, but just today's go.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.760]   Somebody on Twitter thanked an airline for moving them
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.280]   because they sat next to someone--
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.400]   I think it was David Carr, The New York Times, I think,
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.480]   for saying to someone who thought he was the poster boy for acts.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.760]   It's the worst.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.840]   My son wears it.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.400]   It's actually young--
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.240]   I need to pull them aside and say, dude--
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.800]   They've done an amazing job of convincing young men
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.440]   that it's the right thing to do.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.120]   Well, in my day, it was-- remember high karate, Jeff?
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:29.920]   No, no.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.280]   It was a cologne that the guys had to fight women off
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.920]   with karate chops.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.960]   And then brute for years owned that.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.640]   So I think Ax is just following in a long tradition of--
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.080]   correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm probably
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.280]   asking the wrong person.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.800]   But I think most women just prefer guys
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.240]   do not wear cologne at all.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.440]   I mean, you probably are asking the wrong person.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.040]   I appreciate my humans just smelling clean.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.040]   Yeah, like humans.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:56.560]   Clean.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.080]   Yeah, humans.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.360]   It's like a few of chowered today in a way
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.520]   that you care about being--
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.080]   No, I can't stand for a few, either.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.720]   Dr. Mom says she likes cologne if it's subtle.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.480]   Yeah, I don't like perfume much either.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.040]   It's like it's too much.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.880]   I'm allergic, so I can't wear it.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.760]   There you go, see?
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.000]   All right.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:13.960]   Who did you--
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.120]   Theo, Confessional, did you ever wear a braille cream?
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.360]   No, I'm not that old.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.160]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.800]   No, I did-- when I was a little kid, when I was young,
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.200]   my dad would put dippity through in my hair.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.600]   He'd comb it, because he's trying to--
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.160]   I don't know why.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.840]   He had to conceive the exception.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.200]   It might be true that you have to train the hair to part.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.400]   So he would put dippity--
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.560]   I never did that for my son, and he has no parts.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.240]   So maybe I'm not a good father.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.920]   Well, here's me showing off my ovaries.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.080]   That's adorable.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.080]   I have a picture.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.480]   I'll find it, and I'll show you.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.840]   My sister really has--
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.080]   He's just imagining a mini Leo with your hair all.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.280]   I swear down, yeah.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.640]   I actually do have a picture of it, I think.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.520]   I'll find it while we're talking about our next commercial,
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.360]   which is carbonite.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.680]   Oh, I can do that in my sleep.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.520]   I'm a big carbonite supporter.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.880]   Carbonite is an online backup done right.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.520]   You know you've got to back this stuff up,
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.480]   because there's pictures of you wearing dippity do,
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.360]   and all sorts of stuff on your hard drive,
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.080]   and you'll lose those.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:19.840]   You'll be sad.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.160]   You'll regret it.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.560]   You'll never be happy again.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:27.080]   And that's why carbonite is such a great service.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.000]   It's automatic, huge.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.080]   It's-- let me think.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.520]   It's automatic.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.760]   It's continuous, so you don't have to remember to back up.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.520]   It's to the cloud.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.320]   So-- and that's important, because what you don't want is--
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.120]   you don't want your data to get lost by sitting on a hard drive
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.320]   right next to your computer, and there's a fire and earthquake,
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:51.840]   or something.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.680]   If it's in the cloud, it's always available.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.080]   Mac or PC, you can get it back anytime.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.960]   And the beauty of carbonite is it's actually cloud storage,
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.080]   which is spectacular.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:08.720]   It means that your data is available on an iPad, an iPhone,
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.920]   an Android phone, Android tablet from their free apps
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.760]   anytime you want it back.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.600]   I want you to check it out, carbonite.com.
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.560]   It's free to use for the first two weeks.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.560]   In fact, that should be enough, in most cases,
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.960]   for your first full backup set.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.360]   And from then on, it's very fast.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.760]   It only backs up changes.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.400]   There you go, carbonite.com.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.000]   We're ready to back up.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.080]   Check it out, two weeks free.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.760]   And when you sign up using the offer code Twig,
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.360]   you'll get two months free when you purchase 14 months
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.640]   of price of 12 starts at $59 a year for everything
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.720]   on your internal drive.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.040]   Carbonite.com backup done.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:45.960]   Right, let me see.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.040]   I'm trying to log into my smug mug,
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.160]   because I do believe I have a picture of me with the B2,
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.560]   but I cannot log in, unfortunately.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.160]   Oh, well, I'll have to do it another time.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.320]   It is time for-- well, let me do a couple of quickies first.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.240]   And then we'll do our tip, our number,
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.960]   and our tool of the week.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.840]   Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.640]   No, I think I do have it.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.840]   See, it's in the vacations of folder here somewhere.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:25.000]   Memories of me as a young lad with Dippity-Doo in my hair.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:25.960]   Oh, we want to see lots of these.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:26.960]   That's my father.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.880]   That's my dad, actually.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   Wow.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.320]   Oh, wow.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.200]   Yeah, I think that might be me with Dippity-Doo in my hair.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.200]   I can't tell for sure.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.600]   Are you smoking Leo?
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.680]   What are you doing?
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.960]   Well, I had a habit younger.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.400]   You got a few toaks there?
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.000]   I don't know what the hell I'm doing there.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.040]   There's quite a few.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.200]   These are slides at my--
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.560]   oh, no, this is definitely it.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.840]   These are slides at my sister's head scan.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.360]   This is the Dippity-Doo.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.640]   I was trying to impress a young lady.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:01.680]   Oh, awesome.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.600]   You look very impressed of it.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.160]   You're just a cool--
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.680]   You're holding the bottle of Coke in your sunglasses.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.920]   That's totally cool.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.600]   I would sing I've got some red roses for a blue lady to her
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.640]   with my Dippity-Doo.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.120]   I look like the fawns, actually.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   You do.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:20.640]   You do.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.600]   That's a good shot.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   That is a good shot.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.000]   I'm probably five or six there.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.880]   I think I'm pretty young.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.000]   The bottle of Coke is old school, too.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:29.600]   I love that.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.760]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.200]   That's kind of an interesting picture, isn't it?
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.800]   I'm glad I have that.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:34.920]   That's an upper New York state.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.360]   Yeah, my new profile picture.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.880]   Anyway, sorry about that.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   I got a little distracted.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.160]   Google giving Cornell 22,000 square feet of free office
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.560]   space for five years.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.640]   I guess Cornell is going to build a new campus.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.680]   It got the Roosevelt Island space, right?
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.240]   Yes, this is a big deal.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.600]   The Cornell won that.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.280]   And we're going to try to get the Stanford of New York.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.120]   Yeah, Stanford wanted it.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.000]   Stanford wanted it.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.640]   Stanford wanted it then dropped out because the conditions
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.960]   were not what they wanted, which is too bad.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.760]   They're sure fairly expensive.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.640]   California is about to pass a law that will allow
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:13.160]   self-driving cars in our state as well as Nevada.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.160]   Now, I thought we had self-driving cars,
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.200]   but I guess Google was doing it illegally.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:18.800]   So--
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:19.120]   Oh, right.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.280]   The testing-- test cars, right?
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.360]   The test cars, yeah.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.920]   People have been spotted them on the freeways.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:31.680]   Eric Schmidt told the class of 2012 at BU, Boston
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.760]   University, to be an Adorer of Life.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.400]   Yeah, pretty.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.200]   Pretty mushy, smushy, good.
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.000]   Can I have some address?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.400]   I agree.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.120]   Every class enters a history that is up to that point
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.200]   being written for it.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.000]   This is no different.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.880]   What is different, though, is the chance
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.400]   that each generation has to make history and make it larger.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.280]   Your generation's opportunities are greater.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.200]   I like this, actually.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.440]   I don't know if it's true.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.680]   The fact that probably isn't.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.080]   Your generation's opportunities are
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.600]   greater than any generations in modern history.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.440]   It's always good to tell graduates, you know,
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.640]   the future is bright.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.040]   There's no jobs, but other than that.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.360]   We actually-- your future is actually worse
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.920]   than any generation I could think of.
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.400]   But I'm going to lie to you.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.200]   I'm going to lie.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.200]   My favorite quote from this is he said, people bemo
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.160]   in this generation as growing up living life in front of screens
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.240]   always connected to something or someone.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.160]   These people are wrong.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.240]   They're absolutely wrong.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.200]   The fact that we're all connected now is a blessing, not a curse.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.560]   And we can solve many, many problems in the world as a result.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.800]   So you get back on Facebook, graduates.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.520]   He says, you can write the code for all of us.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.880]   You're connected to each other in ways.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.400]   Those who came before you could never have dreamed of.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   You're using these connections to strengthen
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.760]   the invisible ties that hold humanity together
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.520]   and to deepen our understanding of the world around us.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.600]   I would agree with that.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.960]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.520]   But don't try to get a job, because we ain't got no jobs.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   And by the way, you're going to be
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.080]   mired and dead for the rest of your life.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.520]   That college loan-- sorry about that.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.920]   The guy who invented--
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.440]   he was the founder of Grand Central,
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.600]   which later became Google Voice,
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.640]   is now doing a conference calling business.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.280]   Boy, is this a welcome thing.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.320]   It's kind of scary, because we do have a conference call
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.480]   advertiser.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.040]   But what it'll do-- no, I know that.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.360]   But what it'll do is it'll start to set new standards
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.160]   for how they operate.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:20.560]   I agree.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.920]   I mean, it looks really cool.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.520]   I think it's--
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.280]   Well, I think innovation in conference calls
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.440]   is good for everybody and bad for airlines.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.240]   The Uber conference, it's called.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.760]   And it's pretty cool looking.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.600]   Not to be confused with Uber, a car--
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.200]   No.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.400]   Uber's just the new hot word, I guess.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.000]   Uber conference is free.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.480]   Just like Grand Central was, and I presume it's freemium,
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.920]   just like Grand Central was, I would guess.
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:52.720]   Looks pretty cool.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.360]   Look at that.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.600]   Doesn't that look neat?
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.880]   And when somebody's making noise,
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.680]   like it will automatically shut them up, stuff like that.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.160]   All right.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.800]   Real quickly, before we get to the tool tip,
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.760]   I forgot to mention this.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.560]   And I said I was going to the Facebook IPO.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:09.040]   He's kind of crashing and burning.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.440]   The folks at Nasdaq admit their software didn't work.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:15.480]   Some say they knew, but they went ahead with it anyway.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.680]   In fact, there's an interview on Business Insider,
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.000]   Henry Blodgett, talking to an unnamed hedge fund
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.160]   investor who was pretty damn peeved.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.920]   If I understand the interview correctly,
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:35.600]   the gist of it is that the price should have popped.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.640]   That it should have-- the price really never popped.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.160]   It went, started at $38, got up to $45, well, mini pop,
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.480]   and then ended up at $38 or something like that.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.880]   And it's now down below that, I think, the last I checked.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.240]   Yeah, it's at like $32.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.960]   So the hedge fund guy is mad, he said,
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.120]   because Nasdaq wasn't accepting the trades.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.920]   It should be accepting.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.120]   If it had, it would have gotten us $50, $75.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.880]   And my interpretation of that is he was ready to cash out.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.160]   Oh, sure.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.720]   He'd bought in big, and he was pissed
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.680]   that he couldn't make those billions of dollars from the Muppets,
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.000]   you and me, who were too stupid to not buy Facebook
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.280]   at a hideously overvalued price.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.760]   That's my interpretation of it.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:22.680]   I think it's probably good that the Nasdaq software didn't work.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.320]   Because in fact, Facebook's never did pop.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.360]   But what's happening is it's appearing
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.840]   that it's developing that institutional investors
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.600]   had information that the Muppets didn't have,
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.640]   and that's bad.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.120]   That's huge.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.600]   That's a really bad thing.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.480]   So there were revised estimates on Facebook's expectations
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.760]   that were whispered to--
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.760]   Lower expectations.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.600]   Lowered it, that they thought they were going
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.560]   to have an even worse quarter than they'd had.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.640]   The quarter before, which was already bad,
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.160]   and that when they found this out,
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.400]   they whispered it to institutional investors,
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.880]   but it was never told anybody.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.960]   There is no SEC rule requiring that, apparently.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.920]   Really?
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.920]   Well--
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.960]   According to the budget, this is an absurd and unfair practice.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.440]   The estimates themselves are material information,
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.600]   the consensus of smart, well-trained analysts who have--
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.800]   and this is what's important-- worked with company management
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.800]   to develop realistic forecasts.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.520]   Most investors don't even know these estimates exist,
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.840]   let alone that they're whispered verbally only
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.680]   to a handful of big investors.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.360]   All potential investors should have easy access
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.080]   to these estimates as well as any logic underlying them.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.960]   The SEC needs to change the rules here.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.800]   So because these are not published,
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.760]   they are blessed by the company.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.240]   So the company, Facebook, was telling big investors, in effect,
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:46.040]   we're not going to make as much money as we thought we might.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.280]   But there's irony there is that if the Muppets thought
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.760]   that Facebook was all hot, then the Muppets would have still
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:52.760]   bought the stock out.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.640]   That's right.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.200]   That's exactly right.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.200]   So fortunately, NASDAQ systems failed, and there was no pop.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.400]   Nobody got too badly screwed.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.160]   Well, maybe they did.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.960]   It's $32 now.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.920]   And now the--
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.920]   I've got investors.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.480]   They're suing.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.000]   Yes.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.400]   It looks like Morgan Stanley and Golden Sacks.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.400]   Yes.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.520]   It's just a mess.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.680]   Now, I think the case can be made of Robert Scobble
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.520]   who was making this case on Sunday on Twitter,
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.800]   that Facebook priced it exactly right.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.720]   Because the whole point for Facebook is,
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.800]   they want to get as high a price as they can and actually
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.920]   sell the entire issue at that price,
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.640]   because that's how much cash they're going to get.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.120]   Usually, the investment bankers try
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:37.280]   to get a lower price out the door so that their premium
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.280]   customers can buy it at the lower price,
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.360]   then sell it on the open market to the Muppets,
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.080]   take advantage of them, make a big cash out,
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.000]   in less than a day.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.040]   And in fact, what happened was it went off at $38,
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:50.040]   ended at $38.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.240]   Nobody made a big killing.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.040]   And Facebook made the most cash it possibly could have made.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.000]   I agree with that.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.280]   That's the point of the IPO.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.560]   Somebody here in Seoul was arguing that they're going
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.520]   to hurt them--
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.480]   a guy who knows his financial stuff.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.840]   They're going to hurt themselves because--
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.200]   They were greedy.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.280]   No, because the real value of the stock to the company
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.160]   is to motivate the employees.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.640]   And if the employees don't see a big upside.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.560]   Yeah, so now the employees' strike price
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.200]   will be pretty similar to the actual price in the stock market.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.440]   Maybe even they'll be underwater.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:24.940]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:25.840]   Oh, for a while, it will be--
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.040]   but that's all predictable.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.680]   I think I'll-- I own Google stock.
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.080]   I own Apple and Amazon.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.800]   I think I'd buy Facebook at $30.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.280]   You're a Muppet.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.280]   Muppet.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.280]   That's right.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.480]   That's like a Muppet.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.480]   That's a common term.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.480]   You called my--
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:46.000]   Apparently, that's what the big shot investors call us retail
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:46.760]   investors who are too stupid.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.120]   I don't want to say muggles.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.120]   I want to say muggles.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.040]   They're like the muggles.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.200]   They're people that they plan to take advantage of, basically.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.960]   Like the wizards, right?
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.200]   Yeah, and the muggles.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.320]   And the bactoring foe.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.040]   And then there's the muggles who are just sort
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.120]   of oblivious idiots.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:00.920]   Exactly.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.760]   It's insulting.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.360]   That's totally insulting.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.760]   It's totally insulting.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.160]   And it's exactly how they think of us.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.440]   I just want you to know.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.280]   And so good.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.720]   No pop for them.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.720]   No pop.
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:20.440]   The real issue was that the Facebook price was hugely overvalued
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:24.080]   because it depends on what you think the earnings were.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.360]   But it was somewhere between 30 and 100 times earnings.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360]   And Google is-- I don't know what the Google stock price is--
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.600]   something like 10 times earnings.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.960]   So it just really overvalued.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.400]   And so it was too expensive.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.080]   It was more expensive than it should have been.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:43.160]   Google's at 20 times earnings, roughly.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.680]   Apple-- let's see what Apple is.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.600]   Oops.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.080]   AAPL.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.040]   There you go.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.520]   Apple's at 13.9 times earnings, price earnings.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.680]   Facebook's like 100.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.440]   So that means that the stock is too much,
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.800]   given how much money they make.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:03.320]   And then of course, there's the larger question of--
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.680]   their market's starting to--
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.880]   they had bad last quarter.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.200]   They're going to have a bad quarter this quarter.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.560]   Because display ads aren't working.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.880]   More people are using mobile now than are using the web.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880]   And Facebook hasn't yet come up with a coherent way
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.680]   to make money off that mobile.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.000]   You're buying basically.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.440]   I'm trying to talk Jeff out of it.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.880]   You're making a bet on Mark Zuckerberg, I think.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.080]   And that he will somehow magically-- and I
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.640]   don't think he's that magic-- figure out a way to make money
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.240]   on 900 million people.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.880]   I just believe in platforms.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.800]   And I think that Facebook remains a platform.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.360]   Now, the problem with Facebook versus Google
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.880]   is that it's not an open platform.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.920]   And somebody could come along.
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.040]   But the switching cost is high.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.320]   I think that Amazon and Google and Facebook are platforms.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.240]   And that's where the value falls these days.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:52.160]   And this is why I'm so glad that I don't buy tech stocks.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.120]   But yeah, me too.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.880]   I mean, but that caveat, but it's not an open platform.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.520]   That's just the killer from the end.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.360]   It's a huge one.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.840]   Well, you know, it's politics, not money.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.920]   Talk is good for money.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.240]   Tom Friedman had a column I think this week.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.920]   I don't know where I am or what we come in,
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.840]   in which Jeff Bezos said--
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.480]   the gatekeepers are dying.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.520]   The reason about that is Jeff Bezos, the new gatekeeper.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.120]   Well, not if he's a platform.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.280]   The gatekeeper makes and controls a scarcity.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.960]   A platform opens up for whatever the hell happens.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.560]   So in that sense, is Facebook a platform akin to Amazon?
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.960]   Well, Amazon's closed in some ways.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.160]   Facebook's closed in ways, Google's closed less,
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.760]   but still closed in ways.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:42.640]   We have the open public internet owned and run
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.560]   by private companies.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.640]   And that's Facebook's just part of that.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:53.760]   Well, I guess as they say, as the reporter on the local news
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.960]   always says in his close out, only time will tell.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.040]   It's true.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:00.880]   It is true.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.960]   Will Google and Facebook ever succeed?
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.280]   Only time will tell.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:13.480]   I think Google, when it went off, its IPO was $85,
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.600]   price earnings of roughly $67.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.680]   So it was high.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.560]   It was high.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.840]   How long ago was that IPO?
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.560]   19-- I'm sorry, 2004.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.440]   2004?
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.600]   2004, eight years ago.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.360]   Or--
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.720]   Do you think that in eight years from now
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:33.520]   we'll be sitting here talking about Facebook's stock price?
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.840]   That's interesting.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.120]   The best analysis, the simple analysis I see,
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.920]   is that a billion customers at a $100 billion valuation,
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:45.760]   it's $100 lifetime value per customer.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.720]   Amazon's price to earning is $82.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.800]   It's pretty high.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.680]   So maybe Facebook isn't so overpriced.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.360]   I don't know.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.040]   This is why-- you know, I go back and forth.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.200]   This is why I just don't--
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.440]   I buy market indexes.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.800]   It no load mutual funds, because I'm an idiot.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.800]   The readability upward--
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   G9, it looks like you wanted to talk about that.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.960]   I don't want to leave that out.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.600]   We could probably save it for another show.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.640]   It's been going on for a while.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.160]   But we could save it for another show.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:22.080]   Readability launched read lists where you can grab a bunch
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.920]   of articles together and send them to your iPhone
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.000]   or your iPad in kind of a clean format
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   without the advertising.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.680]   And actually, I feel like Jeff has
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.480]   to have a lot to say about this.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.480]   But maybe next show.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.000]   Next show.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:32.480]   We'll do it.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:32.480]   We'll do it.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.240]   We'll go to the starting at a time.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.440]   Let's get Gina Trepenny's tip of the week.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.760]   How about that?
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.320]   Last week, we talked about Google
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.480]   rolling out their new Knowledge Graph search results,
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.760]   their Things Not Strings update, which basically takes
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.440]   the right side of your search results page
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.880]   and shows kind of a formatted block of information
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.880]   about something when Google knows what you're talking about.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.560]   I just got it.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.920]   It rolled out to my search results a few days ago.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.640]   And there are some pretty cool things you can see here.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.960]   These results are kind of like one box on steroids.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.840]   So one box is like, hey, what time is it in Austin, Texas?
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.040]   And it would tell you kind of right
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.320]   at the top of the search results.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.720]   But the Things Not Strings is this huge box
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:11.880]   on the right side.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.720]   So you can do a few kind of cool things with it.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.880]   Life Hacker did a list of five kind of interesting things
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.560]   you can do.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.000]   First, if you search for a person,
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.920]   like if you search for Leo Laporte,
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.440]   you get an excerpt from Leo's Wikipedia page where you grab--
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.720]   That's what Adam Curry was kind of mocking that.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.080]   Like, these are the facts that Google finds.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.360]   Is that's Wikipedia?
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.000]   This is it.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.600]   This is the knowledge graph.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.400]   Your Wikipedia entry.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.720]   Well, that's part of it.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.760]   Some of it's from Google+, some of it's from Wikipedia.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.840]   I mean, Wikipedia provides a lot of structured data
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.360]   in a way that's very predictable, right?
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.560]   Not a lot of services do.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.000]   Presumably we'll get better.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.280]   But right now, it is Wikipedia and Google+.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.160]   It's basically Wikipedia and Google+.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.840]   And some people, I think if you search for a big name
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.080]   author, like Stephen King, you'll
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.440]   get links to books and other things.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.200]   I was wondering when are my books and apps going
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.400]   to show up in my knowledge graph results?
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.800]   You can also search for cities and places.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.080]   If you search for something like Austin, Texas,
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.840]   you'll get the Wikipedia excerpt, a Google map.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.080]   You'll get what time it is in Austin at the moment,
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:20.800]   the weather.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.960]   You get a lot of facts about that one place.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.200]   You can do the same thing if you're
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.920]   looking for a post office or an Italian restaurant.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.920]   You'll get the nearest ones nearest to you.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.000]   So it's kind of like the best of Google's sort of semantic
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.480]   search all in one place.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.120]   And because they're doing it on the right side there,
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.560]   you get it.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.520]   They have a lot more real estate to show that information.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.560]   And it does have a little link that says
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.880]   report a problem at the bottom.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.600]   So presumably, the crowdsourcing will improve.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.080]   Yeah, hopefully it will.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:47.960]   I think they can do better.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.040]   I think they can add more facts.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.360]   But it's pretty good to begin.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:55.000]   You can search also last day because you search for venue.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.520]   So if I search for Petco Park, which is the Padres,
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.440]   or where the Padres play here in San Diego,
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.440]   and you get the map and the facts about Petco,
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.760]   but you also get a list of events.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.360]   So what's going on at Petco?
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.720]   And the other interesting bit is you get
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.360]   this people also search for, which of course,
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.960]   for an ego search, this is really interesting.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   It's interesting to see if people search for your name.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.000]   What are the other people?
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.600]   Who else are they searching for?
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.960]   And actually, Jeff and Leo, you two
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.280]   are the first two suggestions.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:24.960]   And my people also search for list,
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.840]   and Sarah Lane, and Anil, and Tom Merritt.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.360]   So that's--
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:28.760]   That's funny.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.160]   It's almost the same as mine.
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:35.360]   I get Sarah Lane, Tom Merritt, Kevin Rose, Steve Gibson.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.240]   And obviously, Google knows a lot,
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.920]   but knows that the Twit Gang is connected and related.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:44.160]   Now, I mean, that sounds like that's just
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.320]   from searching search patterns.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.160]   But I imagine they're using some circles.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.120]   It's got to be.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.840]   I bet you circles stuff.
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.320]   It's got to be circles a lot.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.320]   I think it must be.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:56.720]   All right.
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.360]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.520]   That's a great tip.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:01.360]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.760]   I couldn't-- for the reason I couldn't put it in the rundown.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.040]   But here it is.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.440]   Google Vice President David Llewe said
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.000]   that 2/3 of Google acquisitions have been successful.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.040]   And then 100 companies it's bought since 2001.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.040]   Interesting.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.200]   I found that big, we understand.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.960]   I think if you buy that, it's not a bad percentage at all,
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.880]   given what Hillary's like Yahoo and AOL done companies.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.760]   So he cited double click and AdMob as successful operations
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:32.560]   and admitted that Slide was in the 1/3.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.280]   That's kind of sad, actually.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.840]   But though he said that 85% of that team
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.080]   ended up working for YouTube and they've done well there.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.560]   Oh, good.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.360]   Oh, good.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.640]   My tool-- well, I ordered one.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.720]   And I'm excited about the Galaxy S3.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.960]   Scoble saw one and he said it's fast, it's gorgeous.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:57.400]   And you can get it now for a mere $700 on Amazon wireless.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.880]   Holy cow.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.040]   It will be an AT&T phone, but it will work, I guess,
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.520]   with T-Mobile, just not on the HSPA+ network,
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:11.240]   just on the Edge network.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.640]   Amazon Wireless?
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:13.800]   Is it-- oh, it's just so cool.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:17.120]   Amazonwireless.com, yeah, they have the wireless store.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.520]   That's where I've been lately buying my phones.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.000]   So--
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:21.960]   That's a new one on me.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:22.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:26.160]   And usually, it has either unlocked
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.600]   or will have it from the carriers as well.
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.400]   It's going to be end of the month
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.480]   that this phone will come out on AT&T.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.880]   But this-- actually, I went to Expansis
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.360]   about the international unlocked version, because you know me.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.960]   I like to spend lots of money on phones
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.840]   only use for months.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.880]   But I'll tell you what, but a minute arrives, I will show you.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.200]   It's not unusual.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.320]   Usually, there's $600 or $700, because they're unlocked,
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.400]   and you're not subsidized and all that stuff.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.040]   And I don't know what I'm going to do with my note.
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:56.800]   I love my note.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.040]   I might be sad.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.640]   Might be really sad.
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do the show Wednesdays
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.320]   at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time on Twitch.tv.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.480]   You do watch live, if you can.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.080]   We like that.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.600]   That time, by the way, is 2000 UTC.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.080]   But if you can't, we make audio and video
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.040]   available after the fact at twit.tv.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.320]   So please download it.

[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:26.320]   Jeff Jarvis is the author of The Great Public Parts, which
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:31.160]   is a must read for anybody who is curious about the new privacy.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.600]   That's available from Simon and Schuster.
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.000]   He's also a journalism professor,
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.320]   and he's about to board a plane.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.080]   What is your flight soon, right?
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.680]   10, so I'm going to go dashing to the airport shuttle.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.040]   All right, 12 hours in a plane.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:42.720]   Good luck, Jeff.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:43.560]   Thank you so much.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.320]   That's really--
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.160]   How do you feel better, Jeff?
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.800]   Yeah, old, old, old, dad.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:48.640]   Got there.
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.880]   I'll get there.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:54.160]   Jeff took a tumble in the show.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.120]   Gina Trepani is at smarter word.org.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:56.800]   That's where she blogs.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.280]   She's also working hard on ThinkUp at ThinkUpApp.com.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.320]   Great show, as usual.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.240]   Always fun.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.360]   Thank you so much.
