[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hey, you don't usually wear glasses, do you?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Not too often, but these are some glared of blue glasses.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   They're blue blockers. Yeah, I can tell. That's cool. Nice. Welcome, man. Ann always has the best shot because he's a photographer.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I try. Yes. Very nice. Looks so good. Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   All right, I've got to get. Oh, he's got the hat, too. He's the Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And he has a leftover Kamala hat. It's not left over. I've been holding it for just this reason. I knew it would come in handy.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's a little hot for the hoodie. This time you know, it would come back.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Are you just going to have a Biden bumper sticker on one side of the car and a Kamala sticker on the other side of the car and then I'll soon have my Biden Harris bumper sticker in the middle.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   In the middle. They've just put a family. Right. Right. Biden's name on a piece of paper and just tape it onto the hat. You'll be set.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Okay, maybe not. Also, also with us from the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Mmm. She's the master of IOT. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Stacy Higg and bottom.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Hey, hello. Stacey Stacy on IOT.com.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We cannot play Sarah Cooper's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel last night. Why? Why can't we? Who would stop us from doing that, Leo? I don't know.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I mean, besides would it be would it be Killjoy Carson?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Carson is only dealing with the legends or the laws that have they forced us against the law. That's the funny. This is the thing.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Oh, it's against YouTube's. It's not against anything. It's not against anything.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Just puts you at risk of stupidity. But because of automatic content ID on YouTube, it could very easily get it taken down on YouTube until we appeal.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And the problem with this show, like all the shows we do, it has the long term staying value of a dead fish.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   When we get back on YouTube, nobody would watch it. So, it's a terrible chilling effect because it's completely fair use to quote,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   you know, I don't know, we don't have to show it. I'll quote the Jimmy Kimmel show and she was honest. She was guest hosting.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   She's become famous thanks to TikTok. But what I didn't know, but Jeff told us is not only Stacy told you Stacy.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Stacy. Stacy figured out that she was a Google engineer.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And her husband, she's married to a girl. I don't know if she was an engineer. What was her job?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   She was a product manager and she was a UX designer. UX designer.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And then now then became a stand up comedy in the worst possible time during COVID. And but the good news is she like many actually stand ups now have figured out how to use the Internet, particularly
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   TikTok. And this is one of the things that really gripes me about this executive order of putting TikTok out of business in the US is this is a great platform for a lot of comics,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   including Sarah Cooper. She though I would guess is one of the main reasons why the president doesn't like TikTok. Her her lip syncing to his his speeches and talks are really right on there.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I was thinking about our conversation about this last week when, you know, he's threatening to ban it and all that. And you were defending TikTok, the one platform you defend until you get sick of it in a few weeks.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And I love TikTok. What's wrong with you?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I know you do.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I'm glad.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But it occurred to me since then I had a conversation with a reporter that it is the one platform the Republicans have figured out to use Trump hasn't figured out to use.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   There are there are Trumpists, but not as many on a TikTok. No, not at all. I would say, you know, but you know what Jeff, you may not see him because they you're a well known Democrat.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So they don't really do content analysis. They don't know what the content of the TikToks is. I see to I see Trump to pro Trump TikToks.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Occasionally, but yeah, not as many as many as many as the anti Trump TikToks.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And then the other thing is it really it really does strike me that that if TikTok is the modern printing press, then this is a first amendment issue.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It is government interference in speech, even if it's a foreign platform. Hell, printing came from Germany and the Italians were not crazy about that.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Scribes complained, get me started, that the Germans were coming in and making all the money from from printing and getting drunk and ruining the children.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It was those damn foreigners. See, nothing's new.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   If I have to say though, if Trump executed issued an executive order to take down Twitter or Facebook, I would be just as defending just as anxiously defending both.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   On the other hand, I'm even more so with TikTok just because I think it it's you really see some real talented creativity.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I feel the same way if they try to take down YouTube. Of course, the difference is Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are American companies and TikToks are Chinese company.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   That's what I was going to ask if I was just oversimplifying this whole executive order because I assume this went into place because of it's being something that's owned by China.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Because when I read this executive order, it says, TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users, including Internet and other network activity information such as location data, browsing and search histories.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Sounds like every app on Android. Yeah. Oh, it's just excuse. Yeah, that's all.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And I have to say, if you use TikTok on iOS, which blocks a lot of the things that this is not the article we're talking about right now, that blocks a lot of the things that.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   TikTok can do on Android. We just learned, for instance, that TikTok on Android is skirting Google's protection supposedly according to the Wall Street Journal to take the phone identifier. That's not a good.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's not a nice thing. I'm sure everybody does it, of course, but that's not the thing. But it's not doing that on iOS. In fact, it can't really do much on iOS.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   It's not even getting location data on iOS. So unless you turn that on because you want to have embedded in your TikToks. So I don't think TikTok is even as bad as some American companies.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Is the issue then that it's being sent? It's not being sent to China. It's stored in US servers and backed up in Singapore. But I guess the issue would be that a China, China's government could subpoena it and get it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   The issue is that China is the squirrel versus Russia. I think that's the political analysis of it. That plus the various things TikTokers have done against the president.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   But I also feel like it's that the new thing is it's easy. It's hard to have a racist point of view about Russians. They look a lot like us.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   They are slobs. Hitler said, "We can beat Russia." The reason he opened a two-front war against Russia is that those slobs are weak.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Our Aryan troops can beat the slobs easily. Boy did he say that. That's what he said. They were intermention.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So there is a racial identity associated with Russians, but at least in the modern world they're seen as white folks.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's white folks to me. Yeah, that's why folks do. Chinese people, they're clearly others, ferners. We don't like them. So it makes it an easy racist target. The kung flu and all of that.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Not to defend the Chinese government, but the American government could subpoena everything TikTok does too.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And I'm not convinced the American government is going to do good one. We're setting ourselves up terribly here because, yeah, so many countries don't trust us and our access to data.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Well, it's interesting because one of the things, and we've talked a little bit about this, and I apologize, we'll move on pretty quick.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   One of the things people were saying, oh, I forgot, I don't care. I'm moving on. Ten cent is also affected by this.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Another Chinese company because WeChat is part of this ban. WeChat is owned, I think wholly owned by Tencent.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   But you know what else is partially owned by Tencent? A lot of stuff. Well, I'll give you an example. 100% owns Riot Games, creators of League of Legends.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Mr. Trump might want to ban that too, just giving you some ideas. It owns a significant portion of many banks in the US. It's a Chinese company.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It owns a part of Reddit, Chinese company. So this is the problem. You go down this road.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Now you start to wonder, well, how do we disentangle ourselves from Chinese owned companies? That's a hard thing to do.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   They're global. The iPhones made by a Chinese company. Yep.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   But the current administration probably already knows that, right? Because they're smart.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   We're waiting for WeChat was, they're very stable. Geniuses, I hear.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Now everything's going out of my head. I was going to say something interesting. I'm going to stop talking now. Go ahead.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Sorry. Sorry. No, it's not your fault.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's my turn to talk about the US government trying to ban Chinese.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   No, anything you want to talk about? You got a doorbell you like?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   No, currently I don't. I was going to draw attention. The Wall Street Journal actually did some excellent reporting on devices.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Oh my gosh. Sorry. Y'all. I was watching Kamala speak because.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Okay. Jeff, have you been paying attention?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I've been paying attention to the fact that Stacy has much improved for room background on Skype.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Wait a minute. Let's see. Oh my God. There's a plant.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   There are lots of plants. This room has like six plants.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   This one we can see now. Plant tour. I know you can't see them all yet.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Oh, that's so awesome. Plant tour. Ready? Oh, that's a fern.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Look at that. If you had one more fern, we could say Stacy's between two ferns. Look at there's another plant.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   She's crushing it. What a nice room that is.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Russian it on the plant front. I told Stacy before we were on the air.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   That one of the ones it's just right. You need that balance. You see it works. It works. We're right. It's wonderful.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Congratulations.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   We got crap for having no plants and room readers said to put plants on.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   So we put 10 plants on a table. And then on the whiteboard, he just wrote fately R R 10.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Oh, smart. And he's like, and he's like, give it the thumbs up for you, Corey.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   So the Wall Street Journal just did a study about data snarfing by apps or something.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   They actually did one on TikTok, but that wasn't the story I was really excited about.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   That was the story about and them snarfing up the.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Yeah, that was the Android story. Oh, that has a Google reference. Maybe we should talk about that.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Oh, Android is Google.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   They've, you know, look, I'm not saying TikTok is clean as a whistle or the Chinese government is clean as a whistle.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   But the TikTok is being essentially put out of business, at least in the US, without any evidence presented about why.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   It's just, well, because it's Chinese.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   It's just something we complain about other nations doing all the time. But here is the story I was talking about.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   This is an NSA focused story.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And I thought it was worth noting, even if there's no Google.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Well, we don't have to have the Google bits in it. And we are going to get to something very cool.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   She's just trying to give herself license for always giving us crap.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   NSA warns cell phone data location could pose national security threat. That story?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   No, no, this is this is I put it in the rundown. This is a company called Anomally six.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And what it is done is various app makers in the US allow anomally six contracts with the federal government.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Anomally six grabs their data, though, by paying various app makers to embed their SDK on phones.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And so I might download an app that has an SDK from an omally six. But if I have done that, and there's no way for me to know if I have or not,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   then an omally six is taking the data from my phone and selling that access to the federal government.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And that is like, nobody talked about the story. They published it on Friday. I don't understand why they would do that.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It is, to me, a huge deal. But maybe I'm wrong.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And 500 apps, hundreds of millions of users.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   This is how the app businesses run, right? If you are giving something to someone for free, you need to make somebody somewhere and say,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   you're like, yeah, well, buddy, you couldn't. And I talk to companies all the time that embed their SDK in apps.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   You know, not all of its marketing. Sometimes it's like, hey, I'll use your Bluetooth.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Well, we had a sponsor for a long time called BrainTree that does in app payments. And what they sold essentially was the ability to embed their SDK in your app so that you could take in app payments.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   This is very common. Many, most apps I would suspect are using libraries and tools from third parties.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's interesting that there's a company that specializes in an SDK that provides location data to branches of the US government and private sector clients.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yes. Yeah, that's an interesting business anomaly.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Six founded by defense contracting veterans who work closely with government agencies for most of their careers.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   That helps because you can knock on the door and they say, come on in, Joe.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   They built a company to cater in part to national security agencies.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   The firm's capabilities described in documents prepared for military officials that were reviewed by the journal.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   They also explained their business practices in a briefing to Ron Wyden's office,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   whose staff then also described it to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Apparently, Senator Wyden from Oregon has been conducting a probe into the sale of our location data.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Invisitors in the journal have suddenly become the white knight in for our privacy.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   No, no, no, no, the journal is the progenitor of moral panic for the viewer Murdoch that he wants to fight Google.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Right.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   We knew that was going to be a nice set of.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But they also talk about Babble Street, which is another company that does exactly the same thing.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And I would argue it's not moral panic to draw attention to this and say, hey, is this something that we really want?
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Because this is clandestine location tracking on your device.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And I may recognize that, and I have focused on this for a while, I recognize that Google can give my location data to law enforcement if there's a subpoena.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And I also recognize that those subpoenas are getting more and more broad, which we're seeing some court cases come up around that.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I also recognize that when those subpoenas come out, Google can't always tell me what police are looking for.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   So I very much focused on that.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   What I haven't thought much about is this kind of data gathering and used by the federal government.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   But it's relevant, Jeff.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   It's not just moral panic when you think about what the FBI is doing around tracking people.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I was just Leo and I were just 20 weeks ago.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I said I praise the journal and I was trying to say, remember it's Murdoch.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   That's all.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   So, okay, I was like, Jeff, I would think this is a journalist.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Is it safe to assume that it was that was a little.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   If you have a smarts, see the thing about the one of the reasons I started carrying the iPhone and started maybe preferring the iPhone is because it does at least warn you when something is getting your location data and you can say no to that, right?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Google started doing that a little bit.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Google does that now too.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I get those notifications all the time.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   So Google does a constant.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Are those effective against Babel, Street, and anomaly six or by the way, it's spelled anomaly.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Am I when I think anomaly is that not right?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I'm always saying anomaly.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I'm going to have to fix the same words, aren't they?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Yeah, but I pronounce it words anomaly.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Is it anomaly or anomaly?
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   It's anomaly.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Okay.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Where's John McWhorter when we need him?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Mr. McWhorter.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   What does what is an A with an Oolot over me in the pronunciation guide?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's a whole separate letter in Sweden, by the way.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Yes, it should be.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   It should be a whole separate letter here too.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And you know what?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   If you go to a town, this is very fun and true story.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   If you're in Sweden and you're at one of their transport kiosks at like their train stations and seeking like a ticket to like,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Omhurst, for example, if you look under a, it's not there.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   You have to look under a with the little.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Oom-la.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Oom-la.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I'm going to play it right now and see what this is.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Anomaly.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Anomaly.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Anomaly.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Anomaly.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   That doesn't even sound right at all.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Anomaly.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Anomaly.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Anomaly.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Anomaly.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Now I'm really confused.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Okay.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Moving along.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   So should I, even though I get warnings from my operating system that, and I, it feels like I can control location data,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   should I still be concerned about this anomaly six or does that block them?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I'd say be concerned, but most of the time people are not going to be concerned enough, the regular folks.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   People like you, you're probably just going to uninstall the app and just say you know what, forget it.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I don't really care.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I turn on Google location because I like to know where I've been.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Same here.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   I like that history.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So then relax.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Reverb Mike says this is my.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Relax.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   What does it matter?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Reverb Mike says it's my own private via anomaly, Vietnam.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Go ahead.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Yes.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I'll just say relax.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Relax.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So you let them the office.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Let them follow me.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   We all know you're at the office.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Well, that's true.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   It's not like I am.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   You know, there's a certain ego that is inherent in this is that is that we worry that China is going to care where we were.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Yeah, that's what I want to know.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   I don't want China to get a right.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I think it's the wrong thing and all that.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   But at some point it's not worth my brain power to stop China from knowing that I used to go to Taco Bell.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I understand.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I mean, if it's not you, Jeff.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   I understand that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I'm just saying he's our military service people.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Right.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And they're apart from having TikTok on their phone.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   In fact, I have no problem if Wells Fargo, which they do wants to bar employees from having TikTok on their phone.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   I have no problem with that.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   But I have a problem with it being banned from all use in the country because I don't get the threat.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   If I were a spy.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   We don't get the threat for the regular folks.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Right.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   From you and me.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Hack and me is not going to get them much other than a they're going to feel sorry for me, if anything, but outside of that they're not going to gain anything.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I can understand China wants to know where dissidents are, former Chinese residents are American spies, American military.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I can understand all that.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   We know that Strava running app was heavily used by military personnel and they figured out where a secret military base was because there was all these people running around an empty spot in the map in a circle.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   So they said don't carry Strava on you.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Although that has mixed blessing there for a long time.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I'm told there was the Russians or the Chinese thought there was a secret place in the Pentagon because there was a lot of traffic there in and out of there and they thought this must be an important spot.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Turned out was a hot dog cart.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   It doesn't replace tradition.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   That is important.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   It is important.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Traditional spying.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I don't know.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   It sits wrong with me.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   But we don't have to go on and on about that.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   People like me can say it doesn't really matter if they're hacking me.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   But that's not fair to everyone in my opinion.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   We do have a right to privacy to a certain extent.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   If you think about access, even so federal and municipal access to this kind of data, there's nothing that prevents someone who works in any of those places from using that data to.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Maybe stock someone.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Right.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Right.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And that's.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   So I agree.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   We should have the right to protect our privacy.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And I'm thrilled at the iPhone and the Internet.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I don't think it's just a function of a right to protect our privacy.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I think we should be having a discussion about the trade-offs associated with free use of apps and the business models that we should be having it now.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   When you say to someone, "Hey, that's a really cool app, hot or not, whatever.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Is it a hot dog?"
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   That's fun.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   But is that giving up your location?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   What are the trade-offs associated with these things?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I mean, part of it is making people aware because they don't think they are.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And I think it's also really hard to say, or it's really easy to say, "Well, the government doesn't care about my location."
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   I think it's important to show people why they may not want the government to have access to that information.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   So should we ban TikTok?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Should we ban TikTok?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   No.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I'm not talking about TikTok, Leo.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   So discussions like this, should have happened two weeks ago?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Was it two weeks ago when we had that congressional hearing?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Instead of having the grandstanding?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   They should have happened then, and they are still happening.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I mean, some of this information came out because of a Senator Wyden's discussion.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Right.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I think it's just we need to have this ongoing conversation and we need to keep thinking about it.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   We need to keep talking about it.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And one day something's going to click for people.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Right.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Here is a picture of the Pentagon hot dog stand.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   According to Brett Eaton, an information and communications officer for Washington headquarters services, rumor has it that during the Cold War, the Russians never had any less than two missiles aimed at this hot dog stand.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   They thought this was the Pentagon's most secret meeting room, and that in fact the entire Pentagon was a fortress built around this hot dog stand.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   This because according to satellite imagery, this is in the days before smartphones, the Soviets could see groups of US military officers entering and exiting the hot dog stand about the same time every day.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   They concluded the stand was the entrance to an underground bunker where officers were going to get their top secret briefings in a protected area.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Sadly, in 2006, Cafe ground zero as it was known.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   What was torn down?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Wow.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   So this predates location.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   What a name.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   I think it was a colloquial name.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   It was because the missiles were aimed at.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   It was declared.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I mean, ground zero became ground zero because that's where the missiles are.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   That's where the plane because the Pentagon has been declared a national historic landmark.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Even if they tear it down, they had a replacement of with a building of roughly the same size and shape.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   So maybe there's something there that actually is the entrance to a secret underground briefing room now, which is what I would do if I were the Pentagon.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I would actually have the hot dog stand and put the secret meeting room under the hot dog stand.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   That's how that's how they do it on TV shows.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Yeah, the Americans, that's clearly where the secret briefing room would be.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Anyway, it's just depressing.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I don't got nothing to say about TikTok anymore except that.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   This is we're going to take a break and then we are going to talk about the hot new Android phone that was announced today.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Hot from one of the from a surprising company.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Does that help you narrow it down?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Our show today brought to you by Monday.com, a team management platform that lets teams like ours plan, manage and track work in one centralized place.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You can collaborate with your teammates, track everything your team is working on even when the team isn't all at work.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   In fact, especially when the team is working from home or anywhere in the world in any industry, whether you're working with a team of five or five thousand.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Monday.com is the easiest way to keep everyone connected, everyone on track.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And with so many employees working from home today, Monday.com is a project management platform that makes effective teamwork possible anywhere.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Look, one of the things you need is a central place of truth of all the information.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   But I know also, speaking as a team leader myself, one of the things I don't want to do is start using, you know, getting rid of everything we use and use this.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   But I was so excited. We got Eddie to come in and show us how to use Monday.com.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   He's one of their onboarding specialists. He's helped set up some stuff.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   And he showed us how we can automatically bring everything we're doing right now right into Monday.com.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Zoom, Slack, Google Docs, calendars, emails, everything.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And so we continue to use the tools we're used to.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   But now we can see how it's going all in one centralized place.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   You can improve coordination across teams and departments.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   No more stand-ups. No more check-in meetings.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Because you just go to the dashboard and you know exactly what's going on.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And for people like Stacey who likes her perch charts, you can have Monday.com look like whatever kind of dashboard you want.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Again, chart a timeline, a can band. You can have tables like spreadsheets, Monday.com has you covered.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   They even have remote ready templates to get you up to speed in seconds.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   It's completely customizable.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It adapts to whatever you need it to be.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   You'll increase productivity and efficiency while facilitating transparency to improve collaboration.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   They have automation and I love it. It's no code.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   It's no code automation. So you could put, and we did.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   We put the entire team's workflow on autopilot.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   So everything, wherever you're working, flows into Monday.com so we can see what's going on.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Alerts, automatic status updates, project flows, keeping your team on track, confident in their work.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   The other thing I love about this is if you use data to make decisions, and I hope you do, now you're not just guessing.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Well, I think this is how we're doing or this is what's going on.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   You now can see what's going on in real time from a single source of truth.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Track progress, timelines, budgets, and that'll help you make better decisions.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   100,000 teams are already getting things done with Monday.com.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And if you decide to sign up and I think you will, you definitely want to get Eddie or whoever the onboarding specialist is
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   to help you get the most out of the platform.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   They'll help you walk you through it, give you some idea.

[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   We thank Monday for their support.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   A new OEM in the Android ecosystem.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Someone who's never ever made an Android phone.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Any guesses?
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Apple?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   No, that would be good.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   No.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   How about Microsoft?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Microsoft.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   I thought they already made one.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Oh.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   They have never made an Android phone before.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Today they announced their first Android phone.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   It's called the duo.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   The duo, baby.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   And I ordered it.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I use Microsoft doing this again.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I ordered it already.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Well, for one thing they say- This is a tablet, right?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   It's not a phone.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   But it is a phone.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I feel better.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And it's a phone.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   The thing is, I hope people are watching the video version of this because Stacey's Space.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Where are they doing this again?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   What are they doing?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Why are they doing this?
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So you're referring to their ill-fated expedition into the world of mobile phones.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Well, there was the Nokia thing, but even before that they had the Windows phones.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   They had some success until Apple came out with the iPhone.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   That's really what killed Windows phone.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And then they waited while Android and Apple kind of started to dominate.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And then finally they released Windows Phone, which I thought actually was quite good.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   By Windows Phone 8 it was a very nice operating system, but it was too late.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   They couldn't get in company stores.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   They couldn't get Verizon to recommend it.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   It just died on the phone.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   It was actually kind of sad.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   They also took a multi-billion dollar write-off because they bought Nokia, hoping that that would help them make the transition.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   So they're very careful to say this is not a phone.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   This is the Surface Duo.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   I am very intrigued by this.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Now remember we've got folding phones.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   We're starting to see a lot of folding phones.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   This is a folding phone with a hinge.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   It's not a single screen.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   The idea is there is a hinge in the middle and there's a little bit of a bezel.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Here I'll mute the sound.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   There's no reason I should have to hear that.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Stop!
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I would say that, okay, I still would call that a single screen.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   There's just a seam in the middle.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Well, it's two screens.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   It's two screens.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   The problem is that a single screen or it was operated.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   It could do either.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   It could do either.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   So this is their new launcher, for instance.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And that's an 8.1 inch combined screen.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   So you're somewhat right to say that.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   This is basically a modified Android launcher.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You still have the dock.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   You have the left-hand side.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   This is a book, y'all.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Wait till you see the Kindle app that Amazon's done for it.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   It is like a book.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   In fact, that's one of the--
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Yes!
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I know.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   That's one of the killer apps as far as I'm concerned.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Well, no, because the Kindle is really effective at what it does.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   I agree, but I love the idea of having two pages turning the page, that kind of thing.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It's a 360 degree hinge.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Now remember--
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   You were right there, Stacey.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It was continuous, yeah.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   I mean, there's a bezel between it.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   It doesn't have to be.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I like it.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Look at that.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Yes.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   It has to be.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   It's like--
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.760]   I remember this was announced in the group pretty excited.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.240]   And they said they worked with Google.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.120]   In fact, when this morning, Hiroshi Lakhheimer tweeted, "Welcome to our newest OEM."
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.120]   You know what?
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.520]   How weird this is for Microsoft who has for years made operating systems and software
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:29.720]   that third parties would then make PCs around to now be the OEM.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.640]   And Google is providing the operating system and software.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.960]   What the hell is why?
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.680]   They're also still providing Office 365.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.120]   There's always that hook somewhere.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.640]   Yeah, we talked about this on Windows Weekly this morning because they do hope this will
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.880]   be a productivity tool, a business tool.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.880]   I don't think so.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   See, do you like that, Stacey?
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.880]   Why don't you see that?
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.040]   I think I'm like an everything about it.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   I really am.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   I do.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040]   Except for this thing.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   Except for that.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   I don't.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.800]   See that size of that phone as she talks?
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.480]   That's why they're saying it ain't a phone.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:04.880]   It's really a piece of roofing tile that you're talking into.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.040]   I didn't like the tile.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.800]   You're going to get the fingerprints on the back screen when you close it that way.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   Yes, that's right.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   That's not a sound.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.720]   We're all used to fingerprints now.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   That's part of the living.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   No.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.760]   Oh, we found Stacey's weak underbelly.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.800]   No, it's actually not me.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   It's everyone in my family.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:29.000]   Everyone in my family runs around with crazy little limbs, little blocks.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Oh, really?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.800]   Yeah, my daughter is a simple.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   That's interesting.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.600]   How about the other machines?
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.480]   I'll reach out to touch the screen.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.480]   Sit down, Stacey.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.600]   Oh, you're already sitting down.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.680]   $1,400 for 128 gigs.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.240]   $100 more, you get 256 gigs.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   Now, I'll give you some interesting selling points.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.560]   It's less than five meter.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.120]   Each screen is less than five meters thick.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.560]   So together, it's 10 millimeters thick, which is less than an iPad.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   That's thinner than iPad, even folded up.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.280]   That's legit.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   I think it's interesting.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.080]   It has a camera, but it's not a great camera.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   It's a 11 megapixel.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   Well, we don't know.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   It may not.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.880]   You can't take a picture with anything.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.880]   You could.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.560]   So the idea is I would put this in my bag if I were traveling.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   Yes.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.640]   To go, it would replace my Kindle and my iPad.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   Could it replace your phone too?
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   You could put a sim in it.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   I told this thing in my laptop.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   Yep.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   Works on all the kids.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   There's a question.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.040]   If you were going to watch a movie, would you watch it over the both screens with a line,
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.800]   or would you take it on the half?
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:42.480]   You may not have the choice because to span both screens, software will have to be coded
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.640]   to be aware of that.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.960]   It's my understanding.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:52.080]   And the way they could do it, if Microsoft's not being too irritating to bear, well, they
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.320]   can also tent it.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.040]   You can also tent it and watch it on a single screen.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.480]   But half of it is-- each screen is what, Leo?
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.440]   You want the size?
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   The whole thing is 8.1.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.880]   You said those the whole thing open?
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   Yes.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   It's an 8.1 inch.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.560]   So each half is what?
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.560]   I will tell you.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.400]   Well, the didibles right there on the diagram.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   It's up there.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.560]   Yep, but it's not a diagonal for the-- oh, there it is.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.880]   8.3, this diagonal, 5.6 for the single screen.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   So it's a cinch.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   And what's weird is it's 3-2 aspect ratio.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.960]   That is weird, yeah.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.320]   But that's Microsoft Surface.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   That's what they like to do.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.080]   And actually, I'm kind of fond of it.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   I don't mind that.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   Not Windows.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.080]   I like this.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   It is--
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   I like this thing.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   It's going to be just fine.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.480]   Like, when I sit on my couch, I'm trying to think-- they actually showed all trails,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.960]   which is an app I love, in the maps.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.000]   And right now, when I'm planning my hikes, I'm scouring all trails and then opening up
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.800]   the maps to see how far away to drive it is.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.440]   So I'm like, oh, that's kind of a fun use case that I have both things available to
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.680]   me.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.360]   It doesn't feel productivity like content creation because that's my job.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.000]   But it could feel like productivity from the standpoint of sometimes when I'm searching
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.360]   news and then I want to tweet news or then I want to--
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360]   B2B.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:18.080]   Yeah, and remember Microsoft has this app for Windows called Your Phone that will work
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.080]   with this.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.760]   It will take the Android apps and put them on your Windows screen so you can kind of
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.240]   use it in a dual way.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.560]   And I run a Windows app in Android.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.680]   And you can go with a keyboard?
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:38.120]   Yeah, well, it doesn't-- the way they show it is an on-screen keyboard.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:43.200]   Well, you were asking about watching Netflix or something like that.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.600]   And it's cool if it could span across both of those screens.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:52.680]   But if it's spanning across both of those screens, just how much time are you expecting
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.640]   to spend watching a cinema on a device that's small?
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.640]   I bet.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   On an airplane.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.640]   It would be an airplane.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.960]   I used to carry my Nexus 7 that I mourned last week on the airplane.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.720]   It was perfect for watching a movie.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.800]   It was perfect for doing productivity.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.040]   It was the pocket I was having.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:15.760]   But what I'm saying is you would probably just deal with that scene just for that particular
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.760]   circumstance.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.440]   You don't want to do that every single day.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.440]   I'm sure.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.200]   But you would deal with it just because I'm on the plane.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.800]   You think much else I could do?
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.360]   If you want to get it in perspective, it's a little bit bigger than a Nintendo 3DS.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.760]   A lot thinner, but about the size of it.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.160]   So in fact, here's a picture of a kid sitting--
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.160]   He's a person.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   He's a baseball referee.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   I know.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.560]   But that's-- it's like a game-- a little handheld game device, kind of.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.200]   I think a little too big--
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.680]   Stop showing people talking on the phone.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   My goodness.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   There's a guy watching--
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.720]   Builders are not showing a man with huge hands.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.840]   In both cases, they're showing a woman with it, which is a--
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.160]   That's just because women like to talk of the phone.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   Oh.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   No comment.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.120]   You know what it'll be good for?
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.560]   It'll be good for Skype calls or video conferencing calls.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:08.080]   Yeah, I like that they were showing somebody gaming on it, and they had their buddy that
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.760]   they were talking to while they were gaming.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   Right.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.920]   You could use the screens independently.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.080]   There's no Android phone I know of that will do that.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.400]   The Galaxy Fold, once you open it, that's the screen.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:24.640]   But the two screens could have each have a different app in them, which is interesting.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:31.480]   It's kind of like split screen on a Samsung device or an Apple device.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.560]   But I think there's something about a physical hinge with a little bezel that just separates
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.120]   the two in a more-- makes me-- it seems more nasty to me.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.760]   Leo, at the bottom of the Surface Duo page, it shows the charger and the cord and the thing.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   And then it has this weird kind of like license plate.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.280]   You were saying, what is that?
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.600]   So yeah, it's a bumper.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.560]   We talked about this on Windows Weekly because I said, why is that?
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.320]   Paul and Mary Jo got a briefing from Microsoft yesterday about this device.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   That's a holy show.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.480]   But they didn't address it.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.440]   But I think what we came up with-- and we may be wrong-- this is a protective bumper
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.440]   that goes on.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.440]   It comes with it.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.280]   And I think what they're concerned about is that people are going to have the phone
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.400]   and they're going to go, and that's that.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   And slam it shut.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.960]   And it's going to crack the screen.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   So the bumper, I bet, is a little stopper to keep you from slamming the screen.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.120]   Why does it have that big left margin?
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.440]   I don't know.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440]   That's an interesting question.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.600]   I don't know.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.360]   So maybe that's how you hold it in your hands so the ear thumb is not on the screen.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   Perhaps.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   Is it a low bezel?
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   There you go.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   Well, it's not teensy-weensy bezel.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.880]   Well, but it's big enough.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.520]   That would create a holding spot.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.280]   I don't know.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280]   It's nice.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   It's nice.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   What do you think?
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.320]   What's really to me, there are a few things that are interesting.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.240]   One is that it is a Microsoft Android phone.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.200]   Two is that they say it's not a phone.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.160]   It comes loaded with Microsoft Office, all these productivity tools.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.480]   They say it's a surface.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.400]   It's part of our Surface device line.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.160]   But I also-- I'm intrigued by folding phones.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.520]   I was about to buy the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.320]   I think I've ordered this.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.400]   I think this might be better.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.240]   I think this might be more interesting.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.040]   I would love to go to a Microsoft store to try one, but--
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   I can't.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.280]   I don't know more.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.920]   I don't think they have any.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.880]   They did not see reviewers with these.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.040]   Marquez Brownlee does not have one as far as I know.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.080]   So they're being-- they're playing it pretty close to the vest.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.760]   Pre-order now, again, $13.99 or $14.99 for delivery September 10th.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.360]   So I'll have it in a couple of weeks.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.160]   Which one is your order?
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.480]   It looks super small in this guy's hands.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.040]   More storage.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.600]   Exactly.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.040]   Well, it is--
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.960]   I think it is 5.6 inches.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.200]   Yeah, it's like two phones side by side.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:53.760]   It is fairly small.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   Two big Samsung phones, yeah.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.760]   Yeah, it's fairly small.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.200]   Well, it's the fatness of it that's kind of--
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.520]   It's a weird aspect ratio.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.360]   I don't know.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.680]   But like you said, that three to two aspect ratio
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.520]   is pretty common with Microsoft.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.000]   I love it.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.920]   I did a video for Hands on Tech this past week.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.040]   And the laptop that I did that I used had a three to two aspect
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.840]   ratio.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.520]   And I remember some of the comments
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.000]   were talking about how they can't stand that.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.480]   And like, why would you want to have three to two?
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.200]   Because Netflix and Hulu is going
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.640]   to look like crap on those types of screens.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.600]   And the answer is it's not for that.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.680]   Is this for getting work done?
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.360]   This isn't for entertainment.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.920]   So it makes perfect sense.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.120]   They do show people watching videos on it.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.160]   I think it's not as weird when you have full-tended
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.360]   and you're just looking on one screen.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.520]   Right.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.960]   If I had $1,400 to spend and I wasn't
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.880]   going to spend it on furniture, but I have a house
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.160]   to put it on the screen, I would buy this
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.760]   because I'm really interested.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.160]   I think I would use it in ways that are surprising and novel.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.240]   And I'm actually--
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.080]   I hope this does well because I would
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.080]   like to see other people iterate on this concept.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.200]   Thank you, Stacy.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.840]   I would use it too, and not just specifically
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.280]   from the content creation side, like you were saying earlier.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.880]   But there are some use cases where I'd
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.200]   like to have one screen open to an app and another screen
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.360]   be for part of the research and note-taking
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.960]   and things of that nature.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.520]   I would love to be able to have Google Maps on one screen
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.320]   and a note-taking app on another screen
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.440]   as I'm planning on a photo walk and taking notes on it.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.080]   I need to make sure I go at this time.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.880]   And I'd love that.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:35.440]   It's very interesting.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.520]   You hear us, Microsoft?
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.920]   You should send us this because I think we can play really well
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.280]   with it.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.480]   As far as I know, the only person who has one
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.320]   is our friend Harry McCracken, who actually interviewed
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.680]   Satcha and Pennos Pena.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.840]   He was in charge of hardware devices at Microsoft.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.400]   He interviewed both of them and got one.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.120]   So he's going to join us tomorrow--
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.960]   or, yeah, tomorrow on Tech News Weekly.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.640]   He'll be our guest with Jason, who
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.000]   will be very interested in this because he's a host of all
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.480]   about Android and mycocargent, who will also be very
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.240]   interested because he's the host of iOS today and hands
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.160]   on iOS.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.360]   So I think that-- you know what?
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.520]   We very rarely get a new form factor.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.440]   And so it's interesting to see.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.680]   It's also interesting, again, because Microsoft
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.120]   is now shipping Android phones, which even though they say
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.960]   it's not a phone, I think it's kind of weird.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.800]   It's shipping hardware and they're shipping a service.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   So I don't know what they're looking at.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.720]   That's right.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.160]   That's right.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.360]   And they see it as a continuum.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.880]   By the way, you can use the Surface Pencils with it.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.160]   I presume that means I can use this pencil that came with
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.440]   this Lenovo as well.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.320]   I mean, I think it's the same kind of pencil.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:47.840]   Maybe not.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.640]   But I have a few Surface Pencils lying around.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.000]   So if you like to jot notes or sketch, you could do that too.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.320]   It's a really interesting device.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.600]   I'm really pleased to hear you and Stacy say how
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.200]   interesting you are in this because I thought it was just me.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.560]   When we did the live stream way back when we were actually
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.240]   in the studio, and Mr. Sargent and I were in the studio
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.160]   and did the Microsoft event.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.560]   And that was the last thing that they showed that we almost
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.320]   missed because they just sort of, oh, yeah, here's this other
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.560]   device that we want to talk about.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.160]   Both of our jobs dropped because it looked like an
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.520]   interesting device, brand new form factor that's something
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.480]   to be excited about.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.680]   Although let me just remind you all of one of my favorite
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.920]   non-devices that I don't know if that ever made it out there.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.480]   The Surface Table.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.240]   Do you all remember that?
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:37.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   I remember that.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.200]   I was so excited.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.480]   I was like, yes, Sargent.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   I want to say this in action.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.200]   They had it in hotels and casinos.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:46.960]   I've used it.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.600]   It was a weird-- I think it was on a cruise ship.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.360]   It was a weird device.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.600]   The idea, though, is you put something on it, it would sense
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   it.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.680]   So if you put your camera on it, it would show pictures and
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:55.880]   stuff.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.200]   It was a very interesting device.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.840]   This is actually the great, great, great grandchild of that
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.120]   because it's using that PixelSense technology they bought,
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.720]   I think, for the Surface Table.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.240]   I don't want to be a naysayer, but because I think about it
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.000]   more and more.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.440]   I agree.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.480]   It's cool.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.840]   Gee, I want one because I'm not that kind of guy,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.960]   inquisitive.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.120]   But I could imagine finding myself using just one half of
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.400]   the screen constantly.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.600]   Yes, see, that would imagine a lot of apps that are built
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.600]   for--
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.000]   Then you should have a phone.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.800]   Yeah, I think Microsoft's going to have its apps
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.480]   adapted, but developers will have to jump on the bandwagon
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.920]   to take advantage of this.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.840]   The good news is that--
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.240]   I consider how badly apps work on the Chrome.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.520]   So that's what's interesting to me.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.800]   Android tablets have failed.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.600]   It's a failed category because nobody wanted to adapt
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.200]   their apps for a different form factor.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.720]   Same problem the Chromebook faces.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.640]   But this, if an app is just an app, it'll look normal in the
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.040]   5.6-inch screen.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.960]   But if you do adapt it, it could be smart about it.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.920]   And some of the Microsoft apps are smart.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.800]   They showed Adobe, I don't know if it was a PDF reader, but
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.440]   it would have the form here and the thing you're filling out
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.160]   bigger on the right so you could write with a pen to sign
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.360]   your name or whatever.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.480]   So I think some apps will be adapted.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.960]   And they did say Amazon has adapted the Kindle app, so it
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.520]   has that nice page turn.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.320]   I think this might be like reading a book, which will be
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.360]   very interesting.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.640]   That would do much adapt, but it'd still be cool to have.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.760]   Well, I'll get one.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.760]   I'll have it September 10.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.840]   We'll talk about it.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.680]   The thing about it is, though, it's something I think you
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.960]   have to spend some real time with.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:33.240]   Yes.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   To see if it--
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.800]   I-- that's kind of my attitude.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.400]   That's why I buy all the phones I review because I want to
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.360]   spend enough time with it to give a fair review.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.720]   I think the two week I got a loaner two week, now we're
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.120]   going to send it back reviews aren't just that useful.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.560]   I feel like you can spend a lot of time with the device in
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.320]   two weeks, but that's just me.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.480]   You can.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   It definitely takes an effort.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.640]   It's not a necessity to do it.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   You know, all you need to do is--
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.120]   But I will say, like as a smart home person, having actually
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:03.040]   having the stuff in your house with a long call does change
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   how you report on it.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.040]   Especially if you--
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.200]   The problem with this one is--
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.480]   sorry, the problem is not working on the road.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.400]   Yeah, no one can take it on the road right now.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.280]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.120]   Oh, you could, Jeff.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.000]   You just have to pretend.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.920]   Here, you just-- here's what you do.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.360]   You wake up super early.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.400]   You sit in your car for a while, and then you go, and you find
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.600]   another uncomfortable place to sit, like a closet, maybe.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   And then you hang out there for four hours.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.000]   And every now and then your wife can yell at you.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.560]   How's that?
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.560]   What are you in the closet?
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.920]   What's the new--
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.480]   The new electric car that they announced this week, or
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.800]   they're just going to get 500 miles.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.920]   The air, I think of this.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.640]   What is it?
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.480]   A lucid air?
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.480]   Yeah, the lucid air.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.680]   Have you seen the luxury back seats in that?
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.880]   Oh, no.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.360]   Let's take a look.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   Let's take a look.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.440]   The back seats of the luxury version are like a business
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.280]   class seat on an airline.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.920]   So I just have to go sit.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.120]   Ooh, that's-- 500 miles, it's got me.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.520]   Keep going, you'll see how they fold.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.960]   Oh, yeah, that's nice.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:13.200]   Now, Stacy, you're also a electric car owner.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.880]   So I'm going to say something you could say with her,
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.520]   I'm full of it or not.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.800]   I think that only people who don't have an electric car
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.400]   worry about the range of their electric car.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.600]   Once you get one, a couple hundred miles is all you need.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.640]   And I think you're in the cult, Leo.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.160]   No, I was really happy about that.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.240]   There you go, that's what it is.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.240]   Ooh.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   Geez.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   That's a recliner.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.200]   Living in a rural area, I think those people
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.960]   have legit range anxiety.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.120]   If you don't live anywhere near a charger, you're right.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:45.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.360]   Well, no, I think if you just don't live in a suburban area
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.200]   or a city--
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:49.560]   Right.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.280]   Because the type of driving you're going to do
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.360]   is a little bit different.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.880]   Well, some people shouldn't own electric vehicles.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.960]   That might be one of them.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.920]   I don't know.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.320]   Yeah, there's that.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.360]   Because I think you need a pickup truck, Stacy,
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.600]   is what you need.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:03.880]   What?
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.000]   No, I will never drive a pickup truck.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.720]   They're very useful.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.120]   This is--
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:09.920]   They're useful.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.880]   Well, I would try to say--
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.520]   What the hell did they call it?
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.280]   This is one of those car reveal videos.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.560]   It doesn't actually show the car.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.120]   Oh, here comes the car.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.000]   Geez.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.280]   It's a lucid.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.400]   Who makes the lucid?
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.200]   Who is lucid?
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:20.840]   It's a new company.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.640]   It's a former Tesla guy.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.200]   Hopefully it's not Fisker.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.520]   Fisker designs pretty cars, but he has some--
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.040]   Ooh.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.400]   Ooh.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.480]   That is one more thing to break.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.080]   That's all I get to say on that.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:43.040]   Stacy, you speak as a veteran of the gadget wars.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.360]   This is a nice looking car.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.200]   I'm not going to get a Ford.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.920]   I decided to get my cars from people who make cars from now
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.360]   on.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.320]   Oh, that's our bridge.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.920]   The Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.520]   All right.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.760]   I like the reclining seats.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.880]   I just missed-- I was about to see the--
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.360]   seats.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.520]   Yeah, I'll see the video here.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.200]   I only jump ahead.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.600]   Jeff, are you shopping for a new car?
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.720]   Not now.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.120]   Did they say how much is this going to cost?
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.160]   No.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.720]   Since March 10, Stacy, I've gotten two tanks of gas.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.920]   I've only gone through half the second one.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.960]   That's why you don't need a 500 mile.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.760]   I have a budget tank of gas.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.720]   We already--
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.320]   10, 13, 15.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:27.840]   That's right.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.640]   She's all electric, baby.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.200]   Isn't it nice not having to go to the gas station?
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.560]   Oh, I hated it so much.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.560]   Oh, they have three different sizes.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.880]   They have-- wait a minute.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.400]   What?
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:39.960]   The emotional style?
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.640]   What's the emotional-- oh, I see.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.480]   They combine the three into one.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:47.680]   And so it's--
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.080]   I want the smallest.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.200]   Well, this is a BMW, and that's a Mercedes.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.480]   This is the Lucid in the middle.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.400]   It's pretty slick.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.880]   The same old leg room.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.480]   And either the BMW 750.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.960]   If it actually gets made.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.400]   There it is.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:02.920]   The seats down.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.720]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.600]   I really like gorgeous.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.680]   That is gorgeous.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.320]   The reason they do that, by the way,
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.440]   is a lot of the usage for this is limousines or ubers.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.080]   Right.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.000]   So you want to have the backseat as the executive seat.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.720]   That's where your passenger--
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.360]   That's the thing.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.320]   That's the thing.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.280]   If I were to ever get one of these,
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.040]   I'd have to be in the front seat all the time.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:28.560]   Right.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.400]   I'd like to enjoy the backseat.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:35.760]   Optional executive receding later availability.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.840]   Inspired by an executive jet.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.320]   That's pretty cool.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.040]   I have to ask Sam Embell-Samet about it.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.840]   But you're still waiting on Ford, right?
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.240]   Yeah, I'll get mine end of the year.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.720]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.640]   The Mustang Mach-E.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:56.880]   I ordered the first edition.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.160]   So let's take a break.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:03.280]   Can we come back a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling?
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.240]   You won't like.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.080]   R out row.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:07.880]   R out row.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:12.880]   But first, Snaggy.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.760]   I got to find the ads.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.760]   I closed them.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.520]   What am I doing?
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.240]   I'm not all here today.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.040]   I don't know what it is.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.520]   I am with you.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.600]   I'd rather be watching Covela.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.160]   No.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.240]   That's over.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.080]   It's over?
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:28.480]   Oh, good.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.280]   Thank God.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.440]   We got Stacy back.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.840]   I contributed to the Microsoft device stuff.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.600]   I just don't care about TikTok.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.080]   Yeah, no.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.160]   You were good.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.000]   You were good.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.360]   You rocked it.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.480]   You've done your job.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.000]   You can just--
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:41.480]   As always.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.240]   I can just check out from now on.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.680]   Just zone out for the rest of the show.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:51.160]   I showed it I brought to you by-- you know, you know,
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.400]   customer data is kind of like that carton of milk
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.320]   that you've been leaving in the fridge.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.080]   And after a while, you have to look at the date because--
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.560]   if you forget to check the date and you open the milk
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.920]   and you're going to regret that, it goes bad.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.200]   So does customer data.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.920]   30% of customer data goes bad.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.720]   Every year, Melissa, our sponsor,
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.040]   is the company that makes your data accurate and current
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.760]   so you can reach the right customers.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.680]   Sending duplicates annoys customers.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.040]   You don't want to miss customers.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.360]   You want to make sure that when you get a customer,
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.880]   whether it's in your shopping cart
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.800]   or on the phone with a customer service representative,
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.880]   that you get the right address, that you get the right email,
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.280]   that you get the information you need to serve the customer
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:35.880]   right.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.080]   Melissa's been doing that for over 35 years.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.160]   They make sure your data is accurate
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.120]   and they make sure your data is current.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.080]   And they do it in an amazing way.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:51.280]   You can verify addresses, emails, phone numbers, and names.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.560]   And you can do it in real time.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.480]   They have an API.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   A lot of companies have added this to their customer service
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.640]   portal or to their shopping carts
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.080]   so that when customers enter or, you know,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.600]   fat fingers, some data, it gets fixed, duplicated records.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.920]   That's always a bad thing.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.120]   It makes it easy for bad data to find its way into your system.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.520]   I used to get five catalogs from Restoration Hardware,
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.600]   same catalog.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.880]   That costs them money.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   And it annoyed me.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.920]   You don't want to annoy your customers.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.720]   Melissa can help you verify the data
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.640]   as it comes in at the point of entry.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.960]   And Melissa's matching and deduplication tools
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.840]   will help you uncover, merge, and purge
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.400]   hard to find duplicate records
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:35.080]   so you have an accurate view of your customers.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.640]   They have a flexible deployment.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.760]   You could choose from on-prem.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.560]   You can a web service that you can use FTP
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:48.120]   with their secure FTP service, upload a file to get a cleansed.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.800]   They have SAS delivery.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.680]   Choose the way that works best for you, including their API.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.480]   And you'll be glad that Melissa continually
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.400]   undergrows independent security audits
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.240]   to reinforce their commitment to data security, privacy,
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.920]   and compliance requirements.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.760]   They're absolutely dedicated to protecting your data.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.800]   They've implemented strong controls and safeguards
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.280]   that those audits are regular.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.960]   That's why the address experts trusted
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.240]   by over 10,000 businesses.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.880]   You can only identify your customers.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.480]   You can add demographic information to your records--
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.800]   property and mortgage data, marital status, social media
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.160]   handles.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.920]   They'll fill in the gaps, adding emails and phone numbers.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.120]   You can also use their prospect data.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   This is pretty cool.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.600]   You can identify current customers,
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   and then they can help you find new prospective customers
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:39.840]   with that prospect database.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.280]   Melissa is also doing something really good during COVID-19.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.040]   They're supporting communities and qualifying essential workers.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.600]   If your organization qualifies, you'll
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   get six months of Melissa free.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:58.640]   Apply online at the site, Melissa.com/twitm-e-l-i-s-s-a.

[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:29.680]   Now, this is the New Jersey Supreme Court.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.440]   So you know what does it really mean?
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:35.120]   The problem is the courts go back and forth on this.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.760]   Do you have a right not to unlock your phone?
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.760]   Does it violate your--
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.840]   Police with a police.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.360]   With a police.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.840]   Is it violate-- yes, you can unlock your phone anytime you want.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.240]   Can the police demand that you do it?
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:51.200]   Or does that violate your Fifth Amendment right
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.160]   against unreasonable search and seizure?
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.480]   New Jersey Supreme Court has now ruled
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.040]   that compelling a suspect to unlock his or her cell phone
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:04.560]   does not violate the Fifth Amendment.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.400]   You may remember a couple of months ago in Indiana,
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:11.080]   the Supreme Court says it does.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.840]   They're just divergent cases, which I guess
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.320]   means that we're going to have to wait till there's
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.280]   a Supreme Court ruling on this, right?
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.000]   The case was focused on an allegedly corrupt cop
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.080]   named Robert Andrews, a former Essex County Sheriff who
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:31.520]   allegedly tipped off a suspect about appending police
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.960]   investigation.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.320]   Under police questioning, the suspect
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.640]   said, oh, Andrews told me to get a new phone
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.760]   to avoid a police wiretap.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.520]   He also said, oh, yeah, he helped me
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.480]   identify undercover police competent,
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.480]   unmarked police vehicles.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:55.440]   So the police seized two iPhones belonging to the police officer,
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.480]   but they couldn't unlock them.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.560]   And Andrews refused to unlock them
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.640]   based on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.400]   And that's what it is.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.120]   Not search and seizure.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:04.960]   That's fourth.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.720]   This is against self-incrimination.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.440]   But on Monday, the case appealed to the New Jersey
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.080]   Supreme Court, and they rejected that Fifth Amendment claim.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.640]   Couldn't they just grab the text from the other dude's phone?
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.120]   Yeah, or from a phone company records or, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.840]   Yeah, you'd think.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.800]   That's stupid.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.040]   Is the prosecutor an extagrident?
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.920]   Could we just also just say, I forgot my password?
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.640]   Like everybody else on the planet does?
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.600]   No, seriously.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.680]   Just I forgot my password.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.400]   I was going to lock you.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.520]   You be forced to lock away the thumb.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.880]   No, you don't have to have that enabled.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.800]   True.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.720]   Yeah, there's a lot of--
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.720]   There's a lot of reasons not to have a face like you.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   Who was put in jail?
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:57.920]   Who was put in jail for a long time for contempt,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.240]   for not following the--
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.280]   Yeah, there was a child pornography
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.680]   who would not unlock his hard drives.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.880]   So it's been a couple of years in jail.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.120]   Now, I can't remember how that case--
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.080]   Finally got freed, I think.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.320]   I think he got freed.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.360]   So the Supreme Court said the right
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.040]   against self-incrimination only protects defendants
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.400]   against testimony, not the production
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.240]   of incriminating documents, by the way, there's cases
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.160]   that disagree with this.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.120]   Testimony usually refers to speech,
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.800]   but that's not always the case.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.040]   Sometimes a defendant can reveal information
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.080]   by his or her actions.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.920]   For example, if the government doesn't already
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.120]   know who owns a phone, then forcing a defendant to unlock
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.040]   an amounts to forced testimony that the defendant's the owner.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.000]   Court said he can't do that.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.920]   But since the phone's registered in his name
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.960]   and we're in his possession, they said, yeah,
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.760]   obviously you know the past court.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.800]   So if he's forced to enter the pass codes into his own phone,
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.960]   according to the New Jersey Supreme Court,
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.200]   he is not revealing any information
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.480]   the government doesn't already know.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.120]   They know he owns it.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.960]   OK.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.520]   So down, dumb on the passwords do it as a matter
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.680]   because they don't own it.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.720]   That's what you're saying.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.840]   So the crux of it is courts for a long time
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.960]   said we can force you to produce documents.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.480]   Even if they incriminate you, that
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.400]   is not a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.760]   For instance, the government can order
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.840]   a defendant to unlock the safe even
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.000]   in the pursuit of incriminating documents.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.640]   So this does sound kind of like that.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:48.640]   And this is the case that you were talking about, Jeff.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.280]   A Philadelphia man was released from jail
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.800]   after four years of being held in contempt
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.880]   because he refused to unlock the hard drives of Vermont
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:06.640]   federal court, Colorado federal court, Virginia state court,
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.240]   and Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court,
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.880]   as well as the Indiana Supreme Court,
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.240]   all held that they rejected his argument
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.240]   that the Fifth Amendment gave him a right to refuse
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.320]   to unlock his hard drives.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.000]   But in Florida, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.360]   courts have held forcing people to provide computer
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.280]   or smartphone passwords violates the Fifth Amendment.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.680]   So--
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.720]   Well, stay out of Jersey if you know what's good for you.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.880]   No, now New Jersey, Indiana, Vermont, Colorado,
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.240]   Virginia, and Massachusetts, versus Florida,
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.200]   Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:46.800]   I guess it's really--
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.000]   So are we ready for a new story?
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.240]   Oh, we're done.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.160]   All right.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.760]   Do you all have the Twitter features
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.560]   that let you only talk to certain people?
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.000]   Not yet.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.160]   Do you, y'all?
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160]   I do.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:01.680]   I do.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.440]   You do too, Nia?
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.000]   Yes, sir.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.720]   But I'm not utilizing it.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.120]   It's only public.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.000]   When you say only talk to certain people,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.680]   you mean that only some people can--
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.800]   you can say who can reply to you, right?
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.080]   Everyone, people I follow are only people I mention.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.600]   Those are the three choices.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.440]   Who can reply to your tweets?
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.880]   To a specific tweet or blanket?
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.600]   Whenever I write a tweet now, I have an option.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.280]   For that tweet.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:30.600]   Yes.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.640]   So when I say what's happening, I can do--
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.920]   everyone can reply, people I follow are only people I mention.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.880]   Yeah, they additionally put on a governor
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.920]   on the number of replies you could have, right?
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.640]   I believe so.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.400]   I'm not a--
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.360]   That's in here somewhere, yes.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.200]   Where would you see that?
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.000]   Do you see it after you press the tweet button?
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:53.600]   The reply--
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.680]   When I press the tweet or when I retweet with a comment.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.360]   OK.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.960]   So in order to test this, I actually have to tweet.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.400]   Correct.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.000]   You don't actually just hit the button.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.200]   Well, you can just see it at the bottom.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:05.720]   You'll see.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.600]   You don't have it.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.480]   I don't know.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.520]   You don't have it.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.200]   Maybe they're giving it to women and people of color first,
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:12.840]   because we're--
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.200]   Maybe.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:13.720]   We're the most--
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.680]   Because you're bad maybe.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.800]   Because we're the most maligned people on Twitter.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.800]   I have-- when after the Twitter hack,
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.080]   I sent my account to private.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.600]   So maybe it doesn't make sense if you have a private account.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.600]   If your account's already private,
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.760]   everyone can talk to you anymore.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.880]   Not just--
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.080]   Nobody can talk to me anymore.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:33.920]   Nobody can see it.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.520]   And if you could, you can't apply.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.440]   But you can't see it.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.040]   But I feel better because you can't reply.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.680]   Hey, who has--
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.760]   Who here has more than half a million followers?
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   Who has two thumbs and more than half a million followers?
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.200]   This guy.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.440]   Who used to be the most followed person on Twitter?
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.000]   So does it make any difference?
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.840]   If you make your account private,
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.080]   you have half a million followers?
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.480]   You're not that private.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.040]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.640]   I don't know.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.760]   I just didn't want-- I don't know.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:12.560]   I just didn't want any Bitcoin fraud on my account.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.200]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.920]   But it had nothing to do with being verified in the end.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.240]   It's just where they picked on, right?
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:23.600]   And if--
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.440]   And if they didn't--
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.160]   And if they didn't know.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.960]   And if they had that God mode,
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.200]   if they could have easily turned private mode off.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.640]   And then tweeted for me.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.240]   I was going to point that out to you.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.280]   But then I was like, let's not--
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.680]   It's a minor protection.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.400]   But I would like to say here and now, if you don't follow me
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.160]   and you see a tweet from me, it's not from me.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.320]   There's that.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   I was going to say, I said it was dumb kids.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.000]   And I was right.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.520]   It was like--
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.880]   Yeah, you were saying it was an eight year.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.480]   It was a 19 year old high school, recent high school
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.920]   graduate, not named Kirk.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.000]   But he did have pointy years.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.920]   So he thought maybe he's a Star Trek fan.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.520]   We didn't know.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.120]   But then wouldn't he be Spock?
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.800]   Yeah, but maybe he wanted to be--
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.480]   maybe he's saying, I'm the captain now.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.760]   I don't know.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.800]   OK.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.440]   So then we have material design.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.200]   What's that?
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.120]   So I got upset because on my Gmail,
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.280]   suddenly had a bar on the bottom that said email, meet.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.480]   And I took away space from my email on my screen.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.440]   I didn't know what to do.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.400]   I got very angry and I was very unhappy.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.200]   I went and looked around.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.760]   And luckily, the Verge has a piece
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.200]   about how to get rid of that five steps in.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:36.680]   But then--
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.120]   Oh, yes?
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.280]   Because yes, it does.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.480]   You can get rid of that.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.720]   But then-- here we go.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.640]   Let's do this.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.280]   So you go to the settings, you pick your account,
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:49.520]   then you go to the meet thing, and you can click off.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.280]   So you know I had that little extra butt here.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:52.960]   I hate it.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.480]   I never have used meet that way.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.560]   So we're looking-- first of all, I
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.880]   don't use the Gmail app.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.680]   But--
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.920]   No, that's just because you're you.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.640]   Oh, the Gmail app's terrible.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   But you're using the Gmail app.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.560]   Has it gotten better in Gmail app?
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.560]   This is one of the reasons it's terrible.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.200]   At the bottom, you can choose between looking at mail
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.080]   and looking at meetings.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.440]   Is that what that button means?
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.680]   Or making it mean--
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.880]   No, I think no, it's starting an email or starting a meeting.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.080]   Oh.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.480]   So Stacy just did it.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.360]   So you select the hamburger icon--
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.440]   It's so much better, right?
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.160]   Stacy.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.240]   In the upper left-hand corner, scroll down
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.560]   and tap on Settings.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.320]   Select the Gmail account you want to change.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.280]   Scroll down to the Meet category,
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:36.520]   and uncheck Show the Meet tab for video calling.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.840]   That was the most helpful thing that has come of this show.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.240]   Wasn't it?
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:39.740]   You're welcome.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:45.080]   It gave you one more message in your view.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.680]   Right.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.280]   Yeah, I know.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.560]   But what message counts?
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   I'm with you, Jeff.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.560]   Yes.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560]   Hey, all the history--
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.680]   I wasn't that angry, but I appreciate knowing--
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.800]   I just wanted to get rid of it.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.520]   So then, below that, Google's been pushing
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.560]   Meet everywhere they possibly can.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.800]   I really have, yeah.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.440]   So now they have the material design.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.960]   Material design.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.800]   It's just funny.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.240]   OK, I have to hand paste this.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.000]   Hold on.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.880]   Yeah, the spreadsheet's acting weird.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.200]   Well, it's just life.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.160]   I'm really excited about Google's new design system,
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.680]   material design.
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.080]   And he's pointing out--
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:26.600]   How is it?
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   Meet--
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   --everywhere.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.760]   Meet.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.480]   Meet.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.480]   Meet.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.640]   Well, you do remember they had a pretty small marketing
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:34.960]   department.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.480]   Which is when you--
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.040]   Where's that?
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:37.520]   --scheduled.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.640]   There it is.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.520]   That is it.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.480]   That's the year.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:40.920]   That's the year.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.040]   You're covering it.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:42.640]   That's the year.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.480]   Everybody forgets good.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.560]   We have half the faculty trying to go to meet,
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.880]   and half the faculty in Zoom.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.080]   Oh, we've had that happen many times.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.480]   Yeah, you can turn it off because it's there by the phone.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.400]   It's after you put the address.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.960]   I fall for it all the time.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.680]   I'm sitting alone alone in a Google meet.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.040]   And there's nobody there.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.760]   And they said, well, what are you doing there?
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.400]   Well, that's with the link in the calendar.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.200]   Irritating is--
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.840]   Irritating.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.480]   But you got to admit, though, that's
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.200]   how you have to market it and raise awareness,
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.880]   is just keep putting it everywhere.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.440]   Because it's not like they're great at general marketing
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.680]   and getting everybody's attention like a company.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.400]   Or so.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.560]   Is this an example?
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.600]   And it's not like they only have one kind of messaging
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.640]   conferencing app.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.080]   Yeah, there's that.
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.200]   Is this as an Apple as Mark Cantor
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.920]   tweeted of, "And a monopolist behavior
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.880]   leveraging an existing property to take on a competitor?"
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.240]   Oh, come on.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.600]   It's not going to work.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.720]   Nobody has to ask me.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.120]   So does that make it less monopolistic if it doesn't work?
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.520]   It's still monopolist behavior.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.880]   It's just not influencing it.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.800]   This doesn't work.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:57.640]   Did you feed Mike Masnick's thing about Google's ad--
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.200]   his ad debacle?
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.280]   He had to take ads off of Tech Dirt because--
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.600]   Mike's going to be on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.800]   So I want to read about--
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.880]   I know about this so I can ask him.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.120]   So is it on Tech Dirt?
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:09.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.120]   Why are there currently no ads in Tech Dirt?
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:12.440]   There it is.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.040]   Apparently, Google thinks we're dangerous.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:16.520]   Oh, no.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520]   Mm.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:23.480]   That basically puts him out of business.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.240]   Well, the challenge is-- and he talks about this.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.000]   He does a really good job explaining
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.200]   how Google keeps flagging things on his site for being
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.360]   probably-- basically some sort of problem.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.280]   Oh, this is what the Federalist was.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.120]   This was the--
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.120]   Yes.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.240]   They were complaining that--
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.960]   remember the stories from the right--
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.760]   that the Federalist and other conservative journals
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.960]   were being defunded by Google because--
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.240]   but what it is is if they see content on a page
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.760]   that they don't think advertisers want to be near,
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.320]   they'll just say, well, you can't put ads on that page.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.640]   The truth is--
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.000]   says Mike Masnick--
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.960]   ad sense, content moderation just sucks.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.160]   Tons of websites deal with the same kind of privacy--
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   a policy violation notice from Google all the time.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.400]   Two weeks ago, it went into overdrive for us a tech dirt.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.960]   We started receiving policy violation notices
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.560]   at least once a day, frequently multiple times a day.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.960]   Every time the message was the same, telling us
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.640]   we had violated their policies.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.200]   They don't say which ones.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:34.520]   And then we had to log into our ad sense policy center
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.040]   to find out what the problem was.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.920]   Every day for the ensuing week and a half
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.040]   until we pulled the ads down, we
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.360]   would get more of these notices.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.840]   And every time we'd log in, we'd get an ever-rotating list
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.320]   of violations.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.600]   Do you think it's possible somebody's got it in for--
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.720]   That's what I'm wondering.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.960]   That's exactly what I'm looking at.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.040]   The little ones you'd hear this happening 100 times.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.400]   Yes, but this is-- I mean, that's a pretty abusive thing
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.600]   to do, and it's a problem that Google doesn't have a way
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.200]   for his team to reach out and say, it's
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.640]   kind of like when you call the police and you're like, hey,
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.920]   it's highly likely that I will be swatted.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.000]   So please document that.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.600]   Google doesn't have that service.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:19.720]   Google also started claiming our daily emails, which
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.280]   are just snapshots of the blog, were phishing attempts,
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.520]   automatically deleting them from any G Suite users email
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.360]   account.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.400]   Somebody's going after him.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.680]   Somebody.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.080]   Partly maybe because he poo-pooed the federalist story.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.920]   Possibly.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.760]   But Mike makes enemies right and left by fighting the good fight.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.200]   Such a nice guy.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:43.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.200]   We had him on Twitter a few months ago.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.720]   We're going to have him on a Twitter again Sunday.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.120]   I will definitely ask him about this.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.240]   Yeah, on Twitter too.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.760]   Oh, this was on Twitter.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.280]   It was on Twitter.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.120]   And he wasn't on Twitter.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.960]   He was on Twitter.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.040]   This show is on the big show this time.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:57.880]   Hey, hey.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:02.600]   I feel really lousy when you call it the Not Big Show.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.920]   I think our show is good.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.760]   It is the big show.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.320]   Or the kitty.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.400]   This show--
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:06.920]   No, no.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.600]   --to precursor to the big show.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.520]   No, no, no, no.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.080]   The post-cursor.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.920]   This show is our deep philosophy show.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.440]   I really don't want to be a deep philosophy chef.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.640]   That's what she hates.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   She hates it.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   I am a tech nerd.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.640]   I would like to talk about tech.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.120]   Oh, I didn't understand that all this time.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.280]   I wish it's only.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.680]   Can we talk about chips?
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.600]   We talk about chips.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.080]   We talk about idea.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:35.840]   OK.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.560]   Well, that's why we put you on the show
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.120]   to make it less philosophy and more chips.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:41.800]   Chips.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.880]   Let me find a chip story.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.760]   Oh, see the chips?
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.560]   Oh, no.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   No.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.040]   No.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:47.840]   She said, oh, no.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.720]   Well, we do have all the reallocation of Spectrum.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.480]   That's upstate.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.760]   Oh, that's a big story.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:53.240]   Yes.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.320]   Oh, we can do that.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.080]   The Defense Department has finally
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.120]   agreed to give up some spectrum they
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:03.760]   use in the 3-point gigahertz range.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.280]   It'll be applied to consumer 5G.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.960]   So that's not millimeter wave, but it is a high frequency.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.760]   Yeah, 3.5 gigahertz.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.760]   Woo, woo.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.000]   It's not a huge amount of frequencies.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.280]   Only 100 megahertz of frequency.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.560]   Is it one channel?
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.080]   I guess it.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.320]   Because if you have one channel that's 100 megahertz wide,
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.360]   you can put a lot of data in those words.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.400]   So that's the--
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.760]   If your phone is already made and is already supposedly 5G,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.800]   does this not help that?
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.280]   No, because you would need chips that work at this.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.960]   Unless they somehow have a 3.5 gigahertz chip.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.720]   So this is nice.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.280]   This is a US--
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.280]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.800]   I was assuming the phones have the 2.4 gigahertz.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.360]   That's why--
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.880]   Yeah, so Spectrum policy is like--
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.960]   they plan 10 years out as not abnormal to think--
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.800]   So when you're thinking about--
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.120]   I'm going to be freed up for some time.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:04.760]   I don't know.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.800]   We actually have already some 3.5 gigahertz spectrum.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.080]   There'll be a Spectrum auction in December of 2021,
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.600]   followed by a mid-2022 consumer deployment.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.400]   Wow, OK.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.120]   That far out.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.880]   We just did-- yeah.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.560]   So we just did CBRS in the same band.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.000]   So we did a Citizens Broadband Radio Service
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.080]   in the same band that auction just concluded.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.160]   Thank God.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.360]   CB radio has a new home.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.840]   That's how long this takes.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:48.000]   That is CB, right?
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.160]   Now they call it rebranded out family radio,
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.480]   but family radio service.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.720]   But it's the old CB.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.080]   I don't know if it's the old CB radio service.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:57.720]   It is.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.400]   It's the old CB, yes.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.640]   OK.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:07.120]   Because the CBRS-- and that's 150 megahertz in the 3.5 gigahertz
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:15.800]   band, which technically runs from 3.55 to 3.7 megahertz.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.360]   But if you go to Jeep Jambury this year,
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.200]   make sure you bring your CB radio.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.800]   By the way, they call this mid-brand
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.920]   because there's 600 megahertz 5G.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.360]   That's the stuff T-Mobile's doing.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.080]   It's not particularly too fast or anything.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.160]   But it's 600 megahertz, so it goes through walls.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.680]   There's millimeter wave, which is-- where is that?
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.000]   20 gigahertz?
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.080]   It's really high.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.160]   They say it's between 24 and 39 is what we're calling it.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.400]   It's really, really high.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.400]   And that bounces off tin foil.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.360]   That bounces off your nose.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.040]   That doesn't--
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:52.640]   Bounces off water.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.240]   Gosh, go through anything.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.080]   But it's fast.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.120]   Well, OK, so here's--
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.000]   you have to think about it this way, right?
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.440]   So you've got your--
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.440]   there's a couple things.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.560]   So we saw that chart last week where we saw how far things
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.120]   can travel and then how it can go through walls or not
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.200]   or water or whatever.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:11.960]   How fast it can--
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.960]   That was a really good graphic, yeah.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:14.840]   Yes.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.920]   So how fast your radio waves drop off.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.880]   The other thing you have to think about when you're talking
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.400]   about spectrum is channel width.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.040]   So when you get to those higher ranges,
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.240]   nobody's using that very much.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.160]   And because there's so much attenuation,
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.280]   it's just overall less-- it's been less useful.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.840]   So it's not as crowded.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.600]   So you can have these really fat channels.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.400]   So like 100 megahertz wide--
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:39.960]   Why would you--
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.400]   Why you get so much bandwidth.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.560]   And that's why you get so much bandwidth.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.800]   It's 600 megahertz.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.080]   Yeah, it's 600 megahertz.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.960]   Everybody's there.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.680]   You've got like 10 megahertz channels.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.200]   Maybe 20 if you're lucky.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.240]   And the carriers, they have to split that between upload
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.200]   and download.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.840]   Oh, oh.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.840]   So that's--
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.200]   So that's where all of this is coming from.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:07.840]   It's a trade off that you have to make between penetration
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.680]   and availability, usability, and speed.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.920]   So they have 100 megahertz, but they didn't say whether--
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.680]   that's one band.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.240]   And channel width is super nerdy, y'all.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.040]   This is-- again, this is where--
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.600]   I just like--
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.040]   You'd like it.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.120]   I love it.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.040]   Keep talking.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:32.120]   But that's one of the things where people are like--
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.640]   it's an under-discussed element there.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.560]   And if you can--
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.960]   with the millimeter wave stuff, they
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.760]   can even talk about-- they're talking about 60 gigahertz,
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.280]   right?
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.600]   Which is crazy.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.520]   But that doesn't even go through a bush.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.400]   It's like me to my camera right here.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.520]   It's like--
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.200]   Oh, bam!
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.440]   A lot of data really fast.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.000]   And that's why we always talk about how.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.120]   That would be useful in the home, right?
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.800]   For devices to talk to one another.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.160]   That type of spectrum is not necessarily--
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.040]   There was a whole standard that tried to use that,
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.760]   but it actually sucks in the home.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.080]   Because it buys your liver.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.760]   No.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.600]   The reason is because we are giant bags of salt water.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.160]   If you walk around our homes--
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.080]   Oh, OK.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.280]   We're the worst.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.840]   So it really is only useful line of site applications.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.360]   Yes.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.120]   And that's why it--
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.320]   specialized line of site applications.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.320]   Your giant bags of salt water.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.280]   We are.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:25.800]   Salt water.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.300]   Salt water.
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.280]   We're bad for life.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.440]   I thought you didn't talk-- like philosophy.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.960]   That was a highly philosophical day, but you just big.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.880]   That's all we are.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.280]   Oh, we are.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.160]   You're just giant bags of salt water.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.120]   Giant bags of salt water in the water.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.680]   There's Stacy's existentialism.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.640]   There we go.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:42.320]   According to--
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.720]   So the problem is that this mid-band is typically
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.720]   used by military.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.200]   And so this was a big deal.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.000]   The White House announced that DOD has agreed to relinquish
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.560]   a mere 100 megahertz of that 3.5 gigahertz spectrum.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.000]   Here's my next question.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.240]   So that's in the US.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:02.960]   The same thing is not happening in Europe, right?
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:03.960]   So you're 5G hearing.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.040]   Except for everyone.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.360]   Yeah, it's different everywhere.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:12.080]   Well, so there are efforts every time the FCC looks at this stuff.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.560]   And all the chip companies, they make efforts
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.040]   to try to get everybody on the same bands.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.120]   Obviously, that's just--
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.240]   All of them is a seed.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:23.840]   But things like Wi-Fi, actually some of the CBRS stuff
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.920]   that's in this band will be internationally congruent.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.040]   There's actually a word for this,
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.000]   and I can't think of it right now.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.600]   But yeah, so the answer is sometimes it works,
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.440]   sometimes it doesn't.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.160]   When it works, though, it's really good,
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.120]   because that's fewer radios in your devices,
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.960]   and fewer SKUs for a big vendor.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.240]   Thank you, Stacey.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.000]   You're welcome, Chef.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.240]   Fascinating.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:53.840]   I feel better.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.080]   Thank you all.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:00.040]   Now I feel like I need some Gutenberg philosophy or something.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:00.520]   Did you know--
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.320]   I won't really know about channels like that.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.920]   I will promote what's fascinating, the channel with that.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.680]   I never even knew anything about that.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.800]   That's really fascinating.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.800]   Happy to help.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:22.640]   Today is the anniversary of the release of the IBM PC in 1981,
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.520]   August 12, 1981.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.520]   Pissed me off so much.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.760]   What?
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.560]   So I have my own--
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.320]   It's one of them.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.480]   I didn't want big old IBM to come into this.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.600]   This was a-- this was a--
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:36.520]   this was nerd territory, IBM, big old IBM.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   [LAUGHS]
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.080]   [SIGHS]
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:43.960]   19-- what was it?
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.080]   1981?
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.040]   Yep.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.920]   And the Mac was '84.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.280]   '84.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.040]   It was a good decade, the '80s.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:00.280]   The Apple II was '71.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.280]   Nine.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:08.560]   No, no.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:15.800]   [LAUGHS]
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800]   Did you know--
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.160]   I'm going to do it.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.400]   From the "Did You Know" department,
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.240]   Corinna Gizmodo, Boeing 747s use floppy disks
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.600]   to get software updates.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.760]   Well, not very often, considering most of the 747s
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.720]   are going to--
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.080]   what's it--
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:35.960]   Mojave.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:39.720]   But you don't want one with a bad firmware.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.360]   No.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.640]   Because we do want to land.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.120]   It's part of the DEF CON hacker convention, which
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.960]   just ended in--
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.080]   well, I was going to say in Vegas,
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.000]   but everywhere in the world because it wasn't in Vegas.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.280]   PenTest Partners, a cybersecurity firm,
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.720]   showed off a video walkthrough of a British Airways 747.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:05.120]   After the A decided to retire its entire fleet last month
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.000]   due to the pandemic, lots of interesting stuff,
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.520]   including the discovery of a 3 and 1/2 inch floppy disk
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.440]   drive.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.920]   By the way, very thoughtful.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.840]   Right next to it, disk gets storage.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.840]   So you could put your desk down.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.720]   And they have to label it like everything on the plane.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.440]   Yeah, latch closed.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.560]   Disgett's storage.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.920]   You don't want to sketch flying through the air.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:34.320]   It's the 747's navigation database loader.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.200]   It has to be updated every 28 days.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:44.720]   So every 28 days, somebody has to go visit every 747-400
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.920]   and deliver a floppy of updates or won't be able to fly.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.040]   Apparently, same according to the Verge with 737s.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.680]   Oh, I'm watching about the--
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.200]   like you said, the 737, as well as like the B717,
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:06.240]   especially the 717, those are so old.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.920]   And they're still flying a lot of those.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.640]   Yeah, I mean, what would you expect?
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:13.320]   The 747 came out in 1988.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.880]   All we had was floppies.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.720]   It could have been worse.
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.640]   It could have been a zip disk.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.480]   Zip disk.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.960]   Or it could have been a 5 and 1/2.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.760]   Oh, I used to post those on my-- when I was an RA,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   I used those as my door markers.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.320]   I decorated them with the paint.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.640]   And the kids would come up and they'd be like, what is this?
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.400]   And I'm like, yeah, I do.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.760]   No, not actually.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.760]   It wasn't until last year that the US military stopped
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.520]   using 8-inch floppy disks to manage our nuclear weapons
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.040]   system.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.880]   In 2018, here's more trivia.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.480]   This has become the article of floppy trivia.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.040]   In 2018, two years ago, floppy disk sales went up
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:02.200]   because small indie music labels started releasing music
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   on 3 and 1/2 inch diskettes.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.000]   How could you play that?
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.160]   That's a really good question.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.400]   It's inside vapor waves mini boom.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:15.920]   This stuff--
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.840]   Is it like a USB that pops out?
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.200]   It's asking.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.560]   Oh, these kids.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.160]   That's pretty bizarre.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.920]   Well, no, I mean, I had a computer
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.400]   that took 3 and 1/2 inch floppies, or 3 and 1/4,
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.120]   or whatever it was.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.200]   But I mean, I don't have one now.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:38.720]   It's hard enough to keep an optical drive.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:44.080]   Of plundraphonic vapor wave label power lunch says,
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.920]   floppies are cheaper than cassettes.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.680]   They don't have to be tediously dubbed.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.880]   They look appealing.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.840]   They're available in a lot of colors
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.920]   and have cool designs that people like.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.800]   And they don't need to put your pencil into it
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.160]   to rewind the tape.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.200]   That's right.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.880]   And nobody listened to it.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.760]   You can actually put out 11 minutes and 38 seconds
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:09.800]   of 8-bit audio MP3 on single floppy.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.720]   There's labels that do this.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.080]   They sell them on--
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.960]   Oh, they buy the floppies on eBay.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.400]   And I guess if you're that into this,
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.920]   you must have a floppy player.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.280]   Oh, you can buy one for $27 on Amazon.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.360]   There you go.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.960]   And is it have a serial connection,
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.640]   or can I actually connect it to my USB port?
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.320]   Let's see.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.320]   That's the question.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.560]   Connection--
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:41.000]   no, it looks like a USB.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.760]   Nice.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:48.640]   Apparently, this whole thing, there was a mini boom.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.800]   Very mini micro.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.720]   Yeah, I use the USB USB.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.720]   Oh, old school USB.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.640]   Yeah, the readers are 2.0, USB 2.0,
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.520]   from what I'm pulling out.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.000]   That's more than fast enough.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:00.880]   Yep.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.680]   For a whole 8 megabytes.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.360]   Stacey, when you were in Austin, I forgot.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.920]   Did you like the Alamo draft house?
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.240]   Did you like to go visit there?
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:13.840]   I did up until-- I mean, I liked their events.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.600]   It was always a little kind of--
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.000]   the newer reclining seat things, the dinner theaters
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.240]   that took over after Alamo succeeded,
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.800]   those were much nicer.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.680]   Alamo's a little dingy.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:29.440]   I liked the dingy, and I liked the tacos and the beer.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.680]   Well, it eventually became a chain.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:33.840]   In fact, we have one in San Francisco now.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.520]   But as you might imagine, they're not exactly thriving
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.000]   during quarantine.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.920]   So now they're offering--
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.160]   Driving?
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.760]   No, private theater rentals.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.280]   For $150, you can invite 30 of your friends
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.080]   to rent out an entire Alamo draft house.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.400]   They have 40 different movies to choose from.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.200]   It's called your own private Alamo.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.120]   You do have to buy $150 of food as well.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.680]   This is Austin Denver.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.360]   And you can choose-- these are the movies
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:06.960]   you can choose from.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.560]   They sanitize them.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.160]   It's up to the guests whether they want to wear face masks
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.040]   and local laws.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.720]   It is a private screening.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:18.440]   And you remember Alamo was famous for--
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.320]   The list is terrible.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.360]   Oh, it's awful movies.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.320]   I thought it might be current releases or something.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.080]   Oh, no, no.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.480]   There are no current releases.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.680]   Haven't you noticed?
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.080]   Well, something you might have missed.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.680]   But some of these would be fun.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.160]   Like, I actually--
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.760]   Most of the Alamo movies I went to was actually--
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.000]   All movies.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.920]   All movies.
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.160]   I went to the Princess Bride's "Sing Along" and--
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:41.960]   Perfect.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.760]   Or "Olong" rather.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.320]   You got a kid's birthday party?
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:47.000]   Good show "Trolls."
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:47.440]   Everybody--
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.680]   It's like 300 bucks.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.280]   300 bucks for "Olong" to be able to rent out the Alamo
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:51.840]   for that much.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.720]   The Goonies.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:54.960]   Sugar Land Express--
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   You know what?
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:56.920]   You know what?
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:57.680]   I miss terribly.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.880]   Besides Taco Bell.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.000]   What?
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.520]   Movie popcorn.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.840]   I read this.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.080]   I want some greasy, salty--
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.080]   It's good.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.000]   --stakeable for you, yeah.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.080]   Oh, I know what I want.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:07.840]   Same way.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.000]   My dad was the same way.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:10.480]   You can buy--
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.520]   He used to see my stepsister out.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.040]   Really?
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.360]   I can buy the popcorn in the box,
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.320]   and it tastes just like it.
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:19.000]   Yeah, it was the same thing to him,
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.920]   and he continued to send my stepmother and my stepsister
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:22.920]   out pretty regularly.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:24.760]   Get me popcorn!
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.560]   I need popcorn!
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.400]   How large?
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.640]   How large were they got?
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:30.800]   Got the giant one?
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.400]   Because as big as they could get.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:35.280]   Because my dad could eat the bucket.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:41.280]   You know, there is one last blockbuster in the world.
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.040]   It's in Bend, Oregon.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:44.680]   And now you can--
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.000]   That's my neck of the woods.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   Well, get ready.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.880]   You can go to Airbnb's offering sleepovers.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:57.680]   At the rate of $4 a night, at the world's last blockbuster,
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:58.680]   they're having VHS--
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:30:59.960]   $4 a night?
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.120]   Per person, I'm sure.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.680]   They're offering VHS-fueled movie nights
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.640]   at a temporary Airbnb complete with pullout couch bean bags
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:15.880]   and unfettered access to the store's entire film collection
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:16.480]   on VHS.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:20.000]   Stop in like the early aughts.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.560]   The store has a bathroom, but there's no shower.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.520]   There will be snacks, including popcorn, gobstoppers, nerds,
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.080]   raisinets, and laugh-eat-taffy.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.880]   Plus endless hand sanitizer.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.320]   You must be a resident of the Shoots County,
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.680]   and all guests must come from the same household.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.360]   Friends, parties, smoking, drugs, and pets not allowed.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:44.240]   But if you're in to shoot, Blockbuster's
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.640]   got a movie for you.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:53.000]   What I got a kick out of was the tweets that came after Blockbuster
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.120]   tweeted out.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.720]   And they were basically just saying, hey, we're just checking in.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.240]   And of course--
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.640]   First time in how long was it?
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.120]   It was like--
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.080]   Yeah, it was-- was it six years?
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:03.480]   So much so, yeah.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.480]   They revived their--
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:09.840]   So many people started responding back was like, oh, yeah,
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:13.760]   you probably want this old VHS that I've been holding onto
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.960]   in my living room.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.280]   A lot of that in there.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.240]   Let us take a break.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.680]   Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology,
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:24.080]   my buddies in St. Louis, WTT.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.280]   They are one of the top technology solution providers
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.720]   in the world delivering business and technology outcomes
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:34.760]   to large private and public organizations around the globe.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:38.080]   They're the kings of enterprise tech.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.840]   They're in the business.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:41.440]   WWT is in the business of digital transformation.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.360]   One of the ways they support organizations
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.920]   with their digital transformation is
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:48.560]   helping them adapt a multi-cloud architecture.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.840]   Everybody's talking about the cloud.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.920]   But there are real challenges doing it.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.520]   And if you have--
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.840]   WWT is a partner.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.280]   You are lucky.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:02.400]   WWT stays with your organization every step of the way.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:06.240]   From your initial vision to your strategy,
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:09.840]   to turning the cloud on, to migrating to the cloud,
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.080]   to optimizing and managing it and everything in between.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.680]   Their cloud consultants will sit down with you.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:19.400]   They'll help formulate a vision strategy.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.920]   And by the way, they are really experts on process,
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.080]   all kinds of process.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:26.680]   They've spent a lot of energy studying what works
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.400]   and what doesn't work in business.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.880]   And so they can really--
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:32.360]   they know how to use the process to help
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.320]   you plan this migration.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.560]   They know cloud investments only pay off
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:40.080]   when they're aligned to your business goals.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.680]   So that's why they start with the goals first.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.920]   They also offer briefings and workshops.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.640]   They've been doing this for years to help some
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.880]   of the world's largest organizations unravel
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.000]   the complexities of the cloud.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.120]   And man, the cloud can really unlock business opportunities
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:54.680]   for you.
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:55.640]   It is the future.
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.080]   Nobody-- everybody agrees.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.520]   But it's also a little scary and challenging.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:04.600]   That's why to have a partner like WWT is so great.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:06.800]   They're experts in cloud migrations.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.480]   By the way, also application development,
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.040]   they can create a secure landing zone in any cloud
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.880]   with on-demand labs that give organizations access
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.800]   to tools for microservices and cloud native development.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.120]   Once you're up in the cloud, WWT helps you
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.480]   with management and optimization.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.360]   Because they know you don't just turn it on,
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:28.400]   put stuff up there, and go home.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.840]   Living in the clouds and continuing
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.520]   may require constant attention to detail,
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:37.360]   constant tuning of the strategy and the techniques
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.600]   you're using.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.880]   Whether you're looking for cloud native, hybrid cloud,
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:44.480]   on-prem resources, WWT is the partner for you.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.600]   We're closely with Intel to optimize

[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.200]   based on Intel technology for security, performance,
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200]   and agility.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.680]   They also feature Intel's Optane Persistent Memory
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.720]   and other great Intel technologies,
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.320]   workload optimized to deliver affordable large capacity
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.440]   and data persistence for solutions
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.160]   supporting everything VDI to data analytics.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.440]   This is the company you want to work with.

[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.440]   Silicon Valley and St. Louis, they call it.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:04.200]   Greatpeople, www.dot.com/twit.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.960]   So I think it's interesting that Genius lost its case
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.840]   against Google.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.520]   So tell-- this is Rap Genius?
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.600]   Rap Genius.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:18.000]   So they said that Google was putting up lyrics from Genius
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.400]   and Google said, oh, sorry.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:19.960]   Yeah, OK.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:20.960]   They proved it.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:24.560]   They proved it because they had messed with the lyrics
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:27.280]   so that they would know if their lyrics appeared anywhere else.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:30.680]   It started codes with different kinds of asterisks.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.480]   We did this story.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.200]   It was really frozen stuff.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.240]   Google's defense was when we didn't buy it from--
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.080]   we were using a third party service to do this.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.280]   Which turned out to be a lie because they were, in fact,
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.920]   still getting the ones were Genius,
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.280]   because Genius spiked them with little clues.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.720]   However, Genius lost because Genius
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.000]   was stealing the lyrics, too.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.040]   They didn't own the copyright, so they had no standing.
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:56.040]   Obviously.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.000]   I thought--
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:57.720]   I thought of the time.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.920]   I thought, how can they sue Google over copyright
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.200]   when they don't own the copyright?
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:01.640]   OK.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.080]   So this whole story-- we did a story
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.720]   when they put the Morse code in the lyrics,
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.560]   and it spelled out red-handed.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.520]   And we even asked, at the time, do they
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.440]   have a license for the lyrics?
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.240]   Who's--
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.440]   Right, I remember that discussion.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.880]   In fact, we guessed that-- well, they must
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:18.880]   have a deal with the publishers.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:19.720]   They must license them.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:20.720]   Apparently not.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.280]   Don't.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.800]   That's a dumb lawsuit.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.280]   Didn't they have an attorney mention that?
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.000]   You know, guys, do you actually license those?
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.520]   Do you have any rights to those?
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.480]   Do you have any standing in this trial?
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.280]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.480]   While we're up on that part of the rundown,
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.240]   I went to my cardiologist a week ago,
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.560]   because it was just regular checkup,
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.200]   because I'm an old fart and things go wrong.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.920]   And he said, is Tech going to solve this being COVID?
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.760]   And I said, how?
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.520]   And he said, couldn't Amazon and Google get together
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:55.520]   and finally make tests that work?
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.840]   And I thought, well, yeah.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:58.360]   Yeah, why not?
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.000]   And Amazon has its tests and Verily is doing tests.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.080]   But if big tech got together and said, governments
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.120]   failed us, we tried that once.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:06.600]   We tried that once.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.160]   Test.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:11.440]   Remember that API that Google and Apple made that--
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:11.920]   I know.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.040]   Nobody used--
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.600]   Well, the problem there is that software
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.520]   trying to solve the problem.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.680]   This is not a software problem.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.200]   They should make the tests.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.160]   They should make the test--
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:20.720]   Apple made face use.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.600]   They should do the tests and do all that.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:23.720]   They could do this.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.160]   Apple and the Google and Amazon--
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.640]   Wait, does that just further erodes any use
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.320]   and utility of government?
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.640]   We need our government to actually--
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:31.640]   Yeah, we don't want to--
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:33.160]   Right now, they have failed us miserably.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.320]   The thing we need most is testing.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:37.120]   And as somebody steps-- and the next thing we're going to need
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.200]   most is mechanisms to distribute vaccines,
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.560]   not what we get one.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.560]   Right now, if we could all have a cheap test--
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.120]   Well, the Russians have one.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.720]   A vaccine, yeah, sure.
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:50.560]   Trouble be taking it.
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.640]   So I just don't know-- so you rightly--
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.160]   I mean, they stepped up.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:00.080]   Who's heard of the Tracie Act's app?
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.720]   Four states said they'd use it they never did.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:03.920]   A few nations have.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.880]   Nobody has--
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.920]   It turns out nobody--
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.040]   You need contact tracing is--
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.360]   You need contact tracing when you have fewer cases.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.240]   When everybody's getting it, it doesn't do me good.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:12.760]   It's nothing.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:15.080]   But if we do desperately need testing still,
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.440]   it's a huge failure.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.440]   And technology could have stepped up.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.040]   They still could.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.440]   I agree.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.680]   Here's a good gig.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.720]   Throw some money at the government
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:26.040]   to help speed up the process if you have to.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.040]   Whatever it takes.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:29.440]   Got the cash.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.120]   We all got time.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.400]   We all got time.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.080]   Got nothing but it.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.320]   I think it's harder than that.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.080]   I don't think you can just do it.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.000]   Why do you say that?
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.440]   Because if you could, then they would.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.880]   Amazon's making its own test.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.720]   Don't you think Bill Gates--
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.080]   Google Gates--
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.400]   That's what they need to scale.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.360]   Oh, Amazon Google make their own tests.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:53.920]   Yeah, Google--
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.520]   They never get them from somebody else from Abbott
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:57.000]   or somebody.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.640]   They actually have a Google's COVID test.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.720]   I'm telling you, if they put their heads to it,
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.680]   if, well, if the federal government used the defense,
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.080]   what should we call it, act?
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.160]   They could make them do it.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:10.760]   But of course--
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.920]   And it's a production.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.840]   I'm sure Amazon doesn't make its own test.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.800]   They get it from Abbott or somewhere.
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.040]   I think Amazon can do anything.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.040]   OK, so Google's barely has built its own lab.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:25.840]   It does not have its own--
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.520]   Yeah, because that's one of the problems
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.360]   is because these commercial labs are still working right.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.320]   OK, so they can build 1,000 labs.
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:31.840]   Right.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.440]   Well, so one of the challenges facing
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:38.560]   Quest and LabCorp, the big companies that are doing this,
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.560]   is they can't get reagents and they can't get swabs.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.560]   Right.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.320]   So the swabs are for the testing side,
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.480]   but the reagents are for the diagnostic side.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480]   So that--
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480]   Right.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.800]   This is one of the few times I say
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.880]   throw some money at the problem.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:54.720]   Yep.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:56.560]   Because it'll help.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.520]   It would help immensely.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.920]   I just wanted to go out with my questions.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.320]   So Vera, it looks like--
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.520]   is Verily doing PCR tests?
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:11.360]   Yeah, Verily is using Thermo Fisher's TAC PATH test
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.720]   kit, which is just an emergency use one.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.560]   So it may or may not work.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:18.280]   There's that.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:23.520]   But you know, Amazon can put 3,236 satellites in orbit
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.720]   and they can't make some tests for us.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.160]   They can't do everything.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.920]   They've got other things to do.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.880]   They can take over any spots and moles
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:31.960]   and they can't make some tests for us.
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.320]   Biology is so vastly different than--
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.280]   Yes, it is.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.320]   --the heck in Silicon Valley's methodology.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:42.560]   Gasker, cardiologist.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.240]   Cardiologist, Pideen.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.240]   Oh, my-- my--
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:45.600]   --coder people.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:46.640]   My coca-quitterless people.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.240]   Say, why isn't--
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.560]   I mean, why doesn't Bill Gates do it?
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.600]   He's got some money.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.280]   Why doesn't Bill just come up with a vaccine?
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.200]   Come on, Bill.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:56.840]   So there was a guy--
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.440]   There was a guy--
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.680]   Warren Buffett.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:41:59.440]   There was a money in it.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.720]   So Amazon is doing their own labs?
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:02.600]   Yeah, and by the way--
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:03.360]   Yeah, they are.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.760]   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:09.280]   has spent many millions of dollars funding test research.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.880]   And there's plenty of tests.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.160]   There's over 120-something tests out there, Jeff.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.120]   They just need to be going through the process
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.920]   of making sure they're accurate, and that takes time.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.000]   And these are scientists.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:21.760]   These companies, they could do it.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760]   I have faith in them.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.560]   They could do it.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.560]   Why don't you make a test if it's so easy?
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.040]   It will take time.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.080]   It's happening.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.200]   It's just happening at speeds that work with, you know,
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:31.920]   the fact that it is.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.280]   Yes, I mean, we're like, you mean grandpa.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.320]   40.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:35.840]   Hey.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.120]   Now, is this your class--
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:40.480]   Is this your class this 45-minute history of journalism?
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.160]   Yes, I put a bitly link up there.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:47.040]   Because we are remote, what is normally done in class,
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.920]   I had to record as a video.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.000]   And you've made this available to anybody--
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.760]   I made it available to everybody in this class.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.960]   The entire-- if you love my--
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.560]   I know you don't.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.480]   I know you all hit it.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.800]   But if you love my Gutenberg moments, here you go.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.960]   The entire history of media and journalism
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:04.920]   500-some years in 45 minutes.
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.600]   That's really good.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.600]   Did you do it from notes?
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.960]   You just off the top of your head.
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.360]   Oh, no, I did it from notes.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.480]   But I did it in one take.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.760]   Well, I did it a few takes at first.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.040]   But then when I did it, I did it in one take.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:13.880]   That's pretty neat.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.280]   And did you have to hold up these books at any point?
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:16.960]   I did.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:17.400]   I did.
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.880]   I held up Elizabeth Eisenstein's--
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:21.000]   the pretty impressive--
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.800]   The Asian interchange.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.520]   If school were meeting, would you do this as a lecture?
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:27.480]   Would this be one of your lectures?
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.520]   I would do it as a discussion with the class.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.480]   And I would use material.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.960]   And then I'd ask some questions.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:32.880]   OK, so you don't just--
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.600]   So what I had to do was I had to record--
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:38.160]   this remote learning stuff is hard.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.080]   And I don't have kindergarten.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.080]   You should tell them to do--
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.400]   download--
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.200]   Jeff--
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:51.400]   that will give you more interactive presentation.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.600]   I could ever applause.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.040]   If Sarah Cooper can do it with that audience, I can.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.480]   So I did one on the history, one on the business,
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:02.600]   one on the roles of journalism, and then
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.880]   I'm now having discussions.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.240]   Today was my first class, which felt really good.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.040]   It was 100 students in one Zoom room.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:10.840]   That is not easy.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.120]   But look, by putting this on YouTube,
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.000]   you've already got 373 views.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.080]   You've tripled the number of people who are influenced by--
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.080]   That's right.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.240]   I could hypnotize--
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.440]   hypnotize them.
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.920]   I'd like to check this out.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.960]   It's good.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.400]   I already made your internalism.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:28.960]   I'm fine.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:30.560]   You don't want to--
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.520]   it's youtube.com/jiffjervish.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.400]   Well, I did bit.ly/journalsmhistory.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.280]   OK, that's good too.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.200]   bit.ly/journalsmhistory.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.720]   Why don't we take a little teeny weeny break reeny?
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.600]   Oh, we have to do something before that break?
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:51.160]   Oh, is it changelog time?
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.760]   Did I forget again?
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.880]   Oh, we tried to.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.720]   We wouldn't let you--
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.560]   Hit that drum.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.080]   Put it in the water away.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.840]   The Google changelog.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.200]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.440]   Yo, if you don't like the changelog,
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:09.480]   I love the changelog.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:10.320]   Oh, it's a--
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.320]   I love the changelog.
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:14.520]   But you don't like the--
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.480]   I think Carston makes him do it.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.720]   I'm scared of Carston.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:23.320]   There are lots of ways.
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.600]   Parents now, of course, saddled with a challenging task
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.560]   of homeschooling, in effect.
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:31.080]   You still have classes and teachers like Mr. Jarvis.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.480]   But ultimately, parents are often now called upon to do things
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.640]   like solve math problems.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.560]   Yep.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.400]   Yep.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.400]   Do you remember much better than--
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:40.920]   Hey, Anthony.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.360]   Have you been there, Anthony?
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.480]   You know, there's some of the things I do OK with.
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:48.960]   But a lot of this stuff is totally out of my head
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.840]   because I don't use it.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.520]   Granted, I still know Pythagoras theorem or whatever.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.120]   But I don't use that crap anymore.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:01.600]   But that doesn't excuse me not being able to help the boys,
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.080]   either.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:02.600]   No.
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:02.600]   You know?
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:03.600]   No, they just--
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.600]   No, they help.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:04.760]   Right.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.400]   Yesterday, we did an iOS today that
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:10.320]   was all about some tools for parents who have kids
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.760]   at home learning.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.760]   One of them was Microsoft has a math helper program.
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:19.160]   It lets you take pictures of math problems and formulas.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:20.960]   And it will solve them for you.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.640]   Google's getting into that business, too.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:24.840]   They're going to add a Google lens.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:27.120]   Unfortunately, it's later this year.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.200]   We need it now, Google, hurry.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:31.040]   Both iOS and Android, it will allow
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.920]   you to take a picture of math problems
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.040]   and get step-by-step guides on how to solve them.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.640]   So you know what you need to do, though?
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.400]   You need to have an option in here
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.600]   to do it in certain styles because there's
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.840]   like traditional math, there's Singapore math,
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.480]   there's other math.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.480]   And you have to teach it the right way that your kid is learning.
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:54.320]   Yeah, I saw something where an equation that I saw was wrong
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.920]   because apparently the order of operations has changed.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:01.840]   They've never changed the order of operations.
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.640]   Something changed.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.960]   How dare they?
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.160]   I believe it was order of operations has changed.
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:06.680]   Really?
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.200]   Wow.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:10.320]   I was just as excused for getting the answer wrong with this kid.
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.800]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.160]   Don't you try that.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.280]   They changed this on me.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.920]   Kids, they changed this on me.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:16.920]   It's not quite the game.
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.840]   Because the article that I was reading said--
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.480]   The article I was reading said, you probably guessed the answer
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:23.800]   was B or whatever.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:25.240]   And you're wrong.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:28.760]   And it told me why is because you learned on the order
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.320]   of operations this way.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.520]   Now the answer is, yada, yada, yada, yada.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.880]   And I'm like, now?
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.680]   What the hell is this?
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:36.880]   Now?
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.400]   Well, this is the Microsoft math solver,
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.040]   which is free on the App Store and Android.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.400]   It does it as well.
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:45.640]   And Michael Sargent talked about that yesterday.
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.080]   So lenses will do it soon.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.320]   That's pretty cool that you can't do that, right?
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:53.760]   Google Search is also adding 3D molecules
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.560]   to help teach chemistry at home.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.000]   So you can search for propanol and you'll get a--
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:00.640]   That's nice.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:01.840]   That's nice.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.760]   I like that.
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.600]   These are all things--
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.720]   I mean, this is great.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:08.920]   Yeah, this is exactly what it should do.
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:11.320]   And you'll get models and so forth.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.520]   Honestly, the internet is the best teacher ever.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.240]   It just takes time, folks.
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.240]   You have to know where to go and where to--
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.000]   No, it takes time to develop these things
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.120]   to create the content.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:23.160]   Don't come up on the internet.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:23.960]   Don't give up.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.440]   Don't give up.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.680]   There is a new Google Phone App beta,
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.720]   which you can install from the Play Store.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:37.400]   If you're on Android, Google's new Phone App,
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:42.560]   which has some nice features, is now on the Play Store
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.560]   instead of being installed from the factory
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:50.400]   and updated as part of the software update.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.560]   So you may not see it in search,
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:57.920]   but you try to find it.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.400]   Good luck.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:01.080]   I don't know.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.640]   If you don't see it in search, I don't know what you're
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.800]   supposed to do.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.760]   Just keep looking.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:09.760]   For some reason, this is from Android Police.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.560]   You'll have to navigate to it manually.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:16.160]   Oh, well, search Google for it and then click the link
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.000]   that you find or go to Android Police
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.120]   because they have a link there.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:21.720]   That's weird.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:22.640]   I'm not going to worry about it.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:23.920]   I don't talk on the phone often.
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.240]   Yeah, who needs a phone?
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.720]   This-- I love this idea.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.000]   And this isn't going to happen right away,
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.440]   but this is coming soon.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.920]   You know that your smartphone has an accelerometer in it.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.760]   Well, apparently, that could be used to detect earthquakes,
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.480]   basically, like a seismograph.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.480]   Google is partnering in California
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.440]   with the United States Geological Survey
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.880]   and the California Governor's OES Office of Emergency
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.240]   Services to send earthquakes directly to Android devices.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.120]   Now, that comes from Shake Alert, which
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.000]   has seismometers all over the state.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.400]   But seismometers are expensive.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:07.720]   And the plan, eventually, is to, with the permission
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:11.400]   of the phone's owner, you don't need a separate app,
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:14.560]   your Android phone become a mini seismometer.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.560]   It's going to be called the Android earthquake alert system.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.640]   And honestly, with millions of phones,
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:24.800]   this thing could be pretty amazing.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.280]   Isn't it mean it's already happening?
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.680]   No.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.400]   Right now, they're using My Shake,
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:33.520]   but this Google system is coming--
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.020]   No, no.
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:35.320]   I mean, the earthquake is already happening
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:35.680]   with your phone.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.320]   It's not an early warning system.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.960]   It's just not an alert system.
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:40.880]   It's a middle.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.360]   Although you can detect both primary waves and secondary
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.160]   waves, people don't usually feel the P wave, which
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.040]   is the first and fastest wave from the epicenter.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.280]   The S wave is the one you really notice.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.480]   So it could be a little bit of an early warning.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.600]   It could give you a few seconds' warning
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:03.240]   when the P wave arrives and then the S waves on its way.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:05.920]   You can quickly run and jump out of the table.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.880]   You won't have time to move out of town,
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:10.840]   but it'll give you a few seconds anyway.
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:15.240]   I've got to tell you, since coming to Northern California,
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.880]   it's been some weird experiences.
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:22.240]   I got here and there was the first forest fire or wildfire.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:24.880]   And then a month later, there was another wildfire.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:28.120]   And then we got into the crazy rainy season.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.720]   Then this pandemic happened.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.720]   And then I woke up on a Sunday morning
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:34.400]   to earthquake news that wasn't in California
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.760]   but was in North Carolina.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:39.880]   The earthquakes, they left one that you got here.
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:42.840]   They said, "Oh man, it's here, no earthquakes.
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:44.600]   Send 'em back home."
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:48.440]   Such a weird, weird six months to a year now.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:52.040]   You're due, as you know, and I'm sure we told you this.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.080]   And we're due for a pretty serious shaker,
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:56.640]   but we just haven't had a big one since '89.
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.680]   And I don't know, you know?
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:01.920]   How bad was it up in Honolulu?
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.600]   I was in San Francisco in '89.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.040]   You were in San Francisco, weren't you?
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.600]   During the Loma Prieta?
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:08.440]   It was pretty bad.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:11.440]   It was actually the World Series game.
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.240]   The Giants game was going on.
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.080]   And we're sitting here and it starts to shake.
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.640]   And, you know, the big towers,
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:21.320]   this was at Canalstick Park that lit the field,
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:22.720]   the big light stanchions.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:26.400]   You could see 'em swaying by many feet like that.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:30.480]   And then all the players ran out of the dugouts
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:32.240]   into the center of the field.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:34.840]   And they grabbed, by the way, it was really insulted.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:37.560]   They reached up into the stands, got their wife and kids.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.440]   And they all ran out to the middle of the field.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.080]   And then shook, shook, shook.
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:44.640]   And then we're sitting here and the lights went out
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.000]   and it was scary.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.360]   We knew we'd had a big earthquake.
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:50.680]   Everybody from the area knows what it feels like.
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:51.680]   But we didn't know how bad,
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.280]   but that's when the rumors start.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:55.360]   Boy, you really see how that happened.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:56.800]   - And you didn't have phones then with the phone.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.120]   - No, people are listening to the radio.
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.520]   The Bay Bridge is down and it turns into the city's burning.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.200]   It's really interesting.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.320]   So I was with a friend who knew the city pretty well.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:08.120]   We drove back and I went right to the radio station
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:10.880]   to work for the next three or four days.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:11.720]   - Well.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:15.320]   - But that, we haven't had a big one since then.
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:19.240]   So let's see, when is this gonna happen?
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.720]   'Cause this is kinda cool.
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:24.560]   You will not need an OS upgrade.
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:27.600]   It will be integrated in Google Play Services,
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.200]   which means most Android phones will get it.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.120]   Except for the, I'm sorry, Huawei,
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:35.840]   the Huawei phones won't get it.
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:39.000]   It's not clear when this will be available,
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.160]   but I think that's a really neat idea.
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:45.640]   It will give you a few seconds warning
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:46.800]   before the earthquake.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.960]   - Wow.
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:49.800]   Can you imagine if-- - You're just like--
[01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:50.640]   - Hollering.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:51.920]   - It's gotta be a quake.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:52.960]   Get out.
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.720]   If you got enough time, you can get outside,
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.480]   which unless you're in a city,
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:57.880]   probably be alright to do.
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:00.480]   You don't wanna,
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.100]   if you're downtown San Francisco, you stay inside.
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:05.100]   All that. - In your door frame.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.460]   - Yeah, that falling glass could be deadly.
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:14.980]   But apparently there is an XKCD about this.
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:17.660]   From what if, what if everybody
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.820]   stood next to each other and jumped?
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.460]   No, I don't think this is related.
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.700]   - No, I mean-- - Yeah, that's--
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:24.780]   - I'm being funny.
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:27.740]   If everybody on Earth jumped at the same time,
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:28.620]   would it register?
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:29.900]   That was the-- - Would it?
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:30.700]   - I don't know.
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:32.660]   We'll find out. - Okay.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:35.780]   Google Lookout can now read grocery labels
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:37.100]   for the visually impaired.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.820]   That's kinda neat. - That's nice.
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:40.900]   - What is the name of that app?
[01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:43.140]   There is a really nice app that you can ask somebody
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:45.820]   to read a label for you if you're blind,
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:48.780]   and it's kind of a volunteer app.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:51.100]   But this will be part of Lookout.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.540]   So Lookout's still around.
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:55.980]   That's funny. - I forgot Lookout.
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:56.820]   - Yeah.
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:55:00.660]   So you can aim it, the camera on the phone,
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:04.340]   add a label, and a computer voice will say,
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.420]   "What food thinks you're holding?"
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:10.140]   And maybe even read stuff too,
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:12.460]   but it's mostly about identifying food
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:15.100]   in the grocery store.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:18.940]   Be My Eyes, that's the one I was trying to think of.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.580]   - Oh, look. - Be My Eyes is a really neat
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:25.660]   volunteer app for Android or iOS,
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:27.660]   where if you're blind, you could say,
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:29.580]   "Hey, I need some help," and then you press a button,
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:31.620]   calls the first available volunteer,
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:33.220]   you show them a picture and they'll explain
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:34.060]   what's going on.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.620]   - Wow. - Isn't that neat?
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:37.460]   And I know a lot of people do it.
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.780]   It's just fun, you know, you got a little--
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:39.620]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:41.260]   - Yeah, you have the app on your phone,
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:43.700]   you say, "I'm available anytime somebody needs me."
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:46.140]   I know, I love that.
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:49.820]   If you need-- - There used to be like a Q&A app.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:52.460]   Remember way, way back in the day,
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:53.620]   where if you had a question,
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:56.620]   this was before Google was good at this sort of stuff,
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:58.740]   you would ask your question,
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.780]   and it would actually text a person--
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:03.580]   - I think they asked-- - ArtVark or something.
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:05.780]   - Oh, ArtVark, you're right.
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:07.780]   What a memory.
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.540]   Yes, ArtVark.
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:12.260]   - So that went away, but this is still here,
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.700]   so it's kind of cool. - Yeah.
[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.060]   - It was like phone a friend.
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:18.260]   - Call a librarian.
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:24.340]   Google is pushing out some updates to all Android phones,
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:26.940]   running Android 6 or above.
[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:28.260]   We're getting close to Android 11,
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:30.500]   but there are new features for even.
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:35.500]   So Android Auto now works with more cars, I think.
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:42.500]   They've also changed the user interface,
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.780]   so you can see a list of upcoming calendar appointments
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:46.660]   while you're looking at directions.
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:49.820]   You can have a built-in dialer button
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:52.940]   if the appointment has an associated phone number.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:56.340]   And Android Auto users should have more control over
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:58.700]   what they see over their car's infotainment.
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:02.700]   There's a new bedtime mode, not for the car.
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:06.420]   This is something we got on the Pixel phones,
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.140]   but other phones will now get it.
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.460]   And it's a kind of nice thing.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:10.940]   It has a sunrise, a long arm,
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.620]   which kind of gradually wakes you up.
[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:19.620]   Android's Emergency Location Service is being expanded,
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:23.660]   so Emergency Personnel will be provided
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:25.940]   with your device's language settings,
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:29.060]   so they'll know what language you need to speak
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.820]   for first responders arriving on the scene.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:33.140]   I think that's kind of cool.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:34.580]   - That's cool, yeah.
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.980]   I would have never thought about that
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:39.980]   until I moved here and noticed there's so many people
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:42.460]   that speak different languages.
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:45.140]   - Yeah.
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:49.500]   So that's a bunch of new features for Android,
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.260]   in addition to the ones we've already mentioned.
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:57.420]   And Google is testing new profile cards
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:01.060]   that let you add yourself to search results.
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:02.260]   Now this is only in India.
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:06.740]   I'm hoping this will come to the US
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:08.980]   and the rest of the world at some point.
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:09.860]   So they're testing it.
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:13.620]   It's a new user-created profile system called People Cards.
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:15.380]   You create your own profile card,
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.060]   kind of like a business card.
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:19.620]   - Yeah, nobody's gonna spam this.
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:22.340]   - I wanted to ask you, I was opinion on this,
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:24.820]   what do you think of this being rolled out?
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:26.500]   - Well, they have to search for you
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:29.380]   and would you use it for your own personal profile?
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:31.100]   - Yeah, I would, not for someone else.
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:32.100]   Use it for yourself.
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:35.340]   - Yeah, so remember, when you search for Ant-Proit right now,
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:37.700]   you don't really control what shows up.
[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:38.540]   - Right.
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:39.380]   - Right?
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.220]   Google bases it on links and so forth.
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:42.060]   This is nice.
[01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:44.220]   You could say, no, no, this is me.
[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:45.460]   This is what I want you to know about.
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:46.740]   - How do they verify this?
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.780]   - Dad's lunch. - They're Google.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:49.940]   They know everything.
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:54.180]   Google says it has a number of mechanisms
[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:57.500]   to prevent spam and abuse of the People Card system.
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:59.580]   You create it in your Google account.
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:02.740]   You can only create a single card in each account.
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:04.260]   You have to have an authenticated account
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:06.140]   with a phone number.
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:09.860]   It will let users flag cards with bad information
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:14.060]   or you can flag cards you think were created by an imposter.
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:16.900]   And of course, users can delete or edit their own cards
[01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:18.140]   at a time.
[01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:19.420]   - All of that sounded good,
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:21.900]   especially with it being tied to the Google account.
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:24.060]   I just hope they actually stick to that premise
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:26.460]   'cause this is just something that could vary easily.
[01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:28.060]   - Well, you know, somebody's gonna try
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:30.060]   to make a Leo LePorte card.
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:30.900]   - Yep.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:31.740]   - Right.
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:35.220]   - Yeah, I mean, they'd have to figure out a way
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:37.620]   to do it without that risk, but yeah,
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:39.580]   maybe that's how you do a tie to an account,
[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:40.420]   something like that.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:44.740]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:47.260]   the Google Chagelog for this.
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:48.100]   (dramatic music)
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.840]   (dramatic music)
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:55.180]   - There's a little loud on you.
[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:58.060]   - Ben Evans, your favorite.
[01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:00.740]   - My favorite, it's a very good one.
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:03.420]   - It's too long for us to really discuss,
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:06.820]   but we'll put it in here so that people were interested.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:09.380]   Would breaking up big tech work,
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:14.460]   and this is on ben-evons.com.
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.220]   What is, can you summarize?
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:18.100]   - Yeah, yeah, just simply that it doesn't,
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:22.140]   regulation is gonna be better than breaking up.
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.340]   - Right. - That there's network effects.
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:25.340]   And so if you cut off Instagram,
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.500]   and Instagram becomes Instagram,
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.660]   it's still gonna be Instagram.
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:28.940]   You have a really, you know,
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:31.820]   except OG, Facebook doesn't know anymore, okay, fine,
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:32.860]   but it's still Instagram.
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:35.180]   It doesn't change the factor.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:37.780]   And standard oil is not a good example of what this is,
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:39.420]   and what the phone company has went through,
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:40.260]   and so on and so forth.
[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:41.580]   So he argues for other reviews,
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:43.420]   but it's gonna be unintended consequences.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:45.340]   - Yeah, I think I agree with that.
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:46.340]   But if we do agree, I think we all agree.
[02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:47.940]   - There are always unintended consequences.
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:48.780]   - That's life.
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:50.500]   Life is an unintended consequence.
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.460]   - Be weighted indeed.
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:53.460]   - Mom and dad had other plans.
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:56.060]   - That's another philosophical statement from Stacy.
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:58.060]   I just want the record to show.
[02:00:58.060 --> 02:00:59.380]   No, but I think we all agree--
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:01.020]   - Involuntary philosophers.
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.100]   - Some form of regulation is a good idea.
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:04.100]   I think we could agree.
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:05.420]   - That's what you wanna do, right?
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:06.260]   - But it's...
[02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:10.260]   - I feel bad for Mozilla, some big layoffs,
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:12.000]   I think 250 people.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.660]   - Dang.
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:15.860]   - Yeah.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:17.820]   It's refocusing on commercial products.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:22.420]   They're trying to make Mozilla pay better.
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:25.060]   - Well, and this is one of Ben Evans' points again
[02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:27.700]   in another tweet that the government's saying,
[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:31.580]   "Google, you paying for exclusive access
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:34.420]   "is a bad thing and it's a use of your power."
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.700]   Well, that actually pays most of the bills of Mozilla,
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:39.060]   which creates a competitive browser.
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:41.940]   What do you want us to do?
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:42.780]   - Yeah.
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:45.980]   - Yeah, that's literally how Mozilla is funded.
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:46.820]   - Yes.
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.860]   - And to their credit, you can say,
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:52.660]   I don't wanna use Google as a search,
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:54.300]   but if you do, they'll make some money.
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.260]   Just as Apple pays Google,
[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:59.060]   I mean, Google pays Apple to be the default search engine.
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.180]   And Safari, you could change it.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:01.020]   - Model money.
[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:03.800]   - Yeah, $11 billion, I think, last year.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:06.500]   - Wow.
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.460]   (whistling)
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.860]   - All right, your picks.
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:11.000]   Stacy.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.080]   - Are you ready for your thing?
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:16.680]   - I am ready for my thing.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:18.880]   This week is not actually a thing.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:23.440]   Not because I'm lazy, but because I donate blood.
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:27.400]   And I didn't realize this, but the FDA loosened
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:30.000]   the donation qualifications.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.960]   So if you have not been able to donate blood
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:37.200]   in the past, you actually may be able to donate now.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.880]   So like some of the things are, like for a while,
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:43.920]   if you lived in the Europe between a certain, in Europe
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:45.240]   for certain time periods,
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:47.200]   when mad cow disease was happening,
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.240]   they wouldn't let you donate blood,
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:51.680]   but they've since said, that's fine.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.880]   Now you, instead of, if you have gotten a piercing
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.480]   or a tattoo within the last three months,
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:00.960]   you can't donate, but if anything over that,
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:02.400]   and it used to be 12 months.
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.200]   So they've losing a lot of the research.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.960]   - They've reduced it from 12 months to three months.
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.360]   There's a lot of, this is good,
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:09.680]   'cause we need blood right now.
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:11.200]   - Right, so that's the other part.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:13.200]   So because of the pandemic,
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.560]   people are not donating blood as often.
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.960]   Because a lot of people,
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.480]   they would do it at corporate blood drives,
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.000]   but we're not at work anymore.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.400]   So I encourage everyone to look up your local bloodworks
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.200]   or blood organization and donate,
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.920]   because supplies are down in some parts of the country.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.680]   They only have like a seven day supply,
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.920]   and that means, I mean, you don't have to
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:37.840]   if it's not your thing, but if it ever was your thing,
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.360]   and you're just kind of casual,
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:42.840]   it's time to be more active if you feel like you can.
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:43.760]   - I should start again.
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:46.980]   I stopped after I got my gallon pin.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:50.360]   - Yeah, you gotta get your five gallon pin.
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.200]   - I want a five gallon pin.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.120]   Yeah, I thought I've done enough now,
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:58.240]   but yeah, I think I will, I'll start doing it again.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:59.640]   - I mean, if you can't,
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.840]   it is of all the things I do,
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:03.400]   it's one of the most risky,
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:07.280]   because you're in a room,
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:08.880]   donated blood with other people.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:11.360]   Everyone's wearing a mask, but, you know,
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.440]   when you go to the canteen,
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:13.520]   you're not wearing your mask,
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.760]   'cause you're usually shoving like food in your face.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:18.320]   - That's a good point, free cookies and juice.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.840]   I went for the cookies, but I stayed for the juice.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.720]   - I go for the chips.
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:27.560]   - You get chips?
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.680]   - Well, after I donate blood,
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:33.240]   the saltiness is great for me, so I crave them.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:35.240]   They used to have barbecue potato chips,
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.720]   but now they just have place.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:40.080]   - Oh, they don't have chips at mine.
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:43.000]   I'm gonna gotta find yours.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.280]   Jeff Jarvis, time for another--
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.400]   - No, I'm gonna do a simple one night.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.040]   Ben Dreyer, you like Ben Dreyer,
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.280]   I've been Dreyer's English.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:54.560]   - Yes, I have a really funny, great, forever book.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:56.360]   And a really great Twitter account.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:58.720]   Well, tonight with Random House,
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.720]   they're doing the step, which is his game.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:04.480]   They're doing a celebrity step game that you can watch.
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:06.680]   - Oh, fuck. - In a clock ET,
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:09.400]   meaning that's five o'clock your time.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.600]   So it's 45 minutes from now.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.200]   The Zoom sold out instantly, but the YouTube,
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:18.120]   you can watch, Amy Bloom, author, Lisa Lucas,
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:21.880]   who's a major book publisher, Connie Schulz,
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:24.040]   Pulitzer Prize winning columnist
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:29.040]   and wife of Sharon Brown and Pre-Brah.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:33.120]   All doing with Dreyer the English game,
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.520]   which might be 45 minutes, we're saying it'd be a lot of fun.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.520]   - Is it like tough grammar questions?
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:38.880]   What kind of thing does he use?
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.360]   - I haven't gotten the game, I actually want to,
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:42.840]   but I think it'll be fun.
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:44.440]   It's a game for language lovers,
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:47.400]   grammar, geeks and bibliophiles.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:51.360]   - So how would, let's see, do they have a link to the YouTube?
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:55.080]   - If you go to Twitter/BCDwire, which is his account,
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.120]   you'll see a link to this.
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:56.960]   - Okay.
[02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:59.040]   - And then you just sign up for the YouTube.
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.560]   And you can watch it.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.240]   - Too late to register for the Zoom,
[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:04.600]   but the YouTube is all.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:05.600]   - You can watch the YouTube.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:06.440]   - Nice.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:09.560]   That does sound like much more fun than watching the news,
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:12.080]   which is what I was gonna do after the show.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:17.320]   And, what do you got for us?
[02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:19.880]   - Try to be quick because the recyclers are outside,
[02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.000]   making a lot of noise.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.960]   But my pick is for Mr. Jeff Jett,
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:29.960]   that's Jeff Jett with two T's and jetfueljava.com.
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:33.640]   This is a gentleman that is big into aviation.
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:35.240]   He's actually a few-ler.
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:37.840]   And of course he's up in the Seattle Tacoma area,
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:39.840]   so he's gonna be all about coffee.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.040]   Yet he has his own small business.
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:46.120]   - Looks like he has his own roasting machine.
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:47.600]   - And roasting coffee.
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:51.120]   And I heard about it on another podcast that I love.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:54.280]   And I gave it a shot and got my beans the other day,
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.440]   and it's good stuff.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:56.920]   I got the house blend,
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:59.120]   which is a blend of Colombian and Ethiopian.
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:01.880]   So it's just a little sweet.
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:04.360]   And it's a medium, medium ro.
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.840]   So it's really good stuff, good pricing.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:10.640]   And they also make a lot of donations to some good causes,
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:13.120]   such as trying to get kids in aviation,
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:18.120]   as well as supporting the Black Pilots Association.
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.440]   There's a lot of different things out there.
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:23.960]   His family is pretty well known in the aviation community.
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:26.280]   So I just wanna give him some kudos.
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:28.000]   I thought it was cool to see this.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.560]   Black-owned coffee roaster.
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.320]   And he also loves aviation.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:35.280]   - I wonder if his Johnny Jett's brother.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:39.320]   - They look like they may favor each other.
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:43.840]   - That's so cool.
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:47.560]   J-E-T-T is his last name, double T.
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:51.680]   JettFuelJava.com.
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:53.360]   I love it.
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:54.200]   I love it.
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:08:00.160]   Our Mask of the Week is a Discovery by Mr. Jarvis on Etsy.
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:05.720]   This is for your next Burning Man.
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:10.720]   It is, wow, it's a hood, shield.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:13.360]   It's not really a mask.
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.280]   It's a-- - But it will do the function.
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:16.880]   - Yeah, you could wear a mask under it
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:19.600]   for extra protection, which is what I would do.
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:20.800]   - And the hat.
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:22.520]   - It's everything, man.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:24.240]   - And it goes around your shoulder.
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:26.600]   - It's just wraps right on there.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:27.520]   I like it.
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:31.400]   - $49.09.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:36.120]   And I guess this is Etsy, so it's somebody's giz does,
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:37.400]   hand-making these.
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:39.840]   That's real.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:40.680]   I like that one.
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:43.360]   I like that the Jersey cotton.
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:45.160]   Be good for the winner.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:46.600]   - Yeah, not to take over the summer.
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:47.920]   - Yeah.
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:50.700]   Over 20 people have it in their carts right now.
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:53.400]   See, this would be good.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:56.080]   This goes 'cause I still would wear the mask.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.320]   And I do wear a face shield,
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:00.080]   but I love the idea of having a full coverage.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:04.280]   - Gato's, we need it. - Like fashionable.
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:10.920]   - And then your wife made a Holly Hobby face shield.
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:14.840]   This is Carsten's wife, Carsten's wife.
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.240]   I don't know whose wife this is, we can't tell.
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:23.200]   Holly Hobby face shield, I guess that's the Holly Hobby.
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:24.480]   - Yeah, I like that.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.400]   Carsten likes to wear those.
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:31.400]   And this is a mask fitter that does not require 3D printing.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:35.520]   I've shown you my mask fitter, which I really like.
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.320]   And I think if you combine a mask fitter
[02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:41.880]   with these inexpensive surgical masks,
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:45.680]   you're getting really good mask protection.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:47.920]   So this is the Essential Mask Brace.
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.060]   It's a Kickstarter.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:55.560]   Looks like you can get it for $28 for two.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:03.200]   So, yeah, I wear my $20 3D printed mask fitter,
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:10.480]   and it really does make a huge difference.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:11.320]   - Yeah.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:13.400]   - Surgical masks, we just saw a study from Duke
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:15.400]   which said don't wear gators.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.840]   Those gators that the Major League Baseball players wear,
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:19.760]   you know, the next scarf that you pull up,
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:22.240]   they said that actually could be worse than wearing nothing
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.360]   because it aerosolizes it.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:24.760]   - Oh, but that study has been, no.
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:25.600]   - Has it been debunked?
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:28.600]   - No, it hasn't been challenged.
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:30.160]   - It was challenged.
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:31.000]   - Yes.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.720]   - That's the way it is in this epidemic of ours
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:35.640]   is things change all the time.
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:41.440]   However, I don't know if this is now challenged as well,
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.840]   but they did say that loose surgical mask
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:46.840]   actually works very, very well,
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:48.200]   even though it's kind of loose.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:49.680]   But you put a fitter around that.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.400]   This one looks like it's more like a rubber band,
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:54.120]   so it doesn't need to be 3D printed.
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:56.960]   And I will vouch for it.
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:59.640]   The fitter with the paper mask is very comfortable
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:02.480]   and passes Dr. Mom's perfume test.
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:04.840]   She says if you spritz some perfume in the air
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.080]   while you're wearing this, you walk through it
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.560]   and you don't smell it, it's doing the job.
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:09.400]   - Oh.
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:10.240]   - So.
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:11.080]   - Oh, but a good test.
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:11.920]   - Yeah.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:14.400]   Yeah, I sniff all sorts of things with my mask on.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.360]   If I don't smell it, I'm safe.
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:22.360]   That concludes our thrilling gripping edition
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:26.480]   of This Week in Google for your Wednesday afternoon.

[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:44.600]   - Yes, thank you.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:47.040]   - Well, Stacey, you should thank us, I think,
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:50.040]   for what will surely be at least an 8 out of 10.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.640]   - Oh, I don't know.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:52.480]   - I don't know.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.480]   (laughing)
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:55.720]   - Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.

[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:12.560]   His Twitter list is at bit.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.880]   - Give me good more, man.
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:15.080]   - I'm covered Twitter list.
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:15.960]   - Yeah, you can't stop me.
