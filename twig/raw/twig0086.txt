[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, joining us now,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.400]   back from a wild party somewhere in the middle of Texas,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920]   Gina Tarpani.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.680]   Howdy.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.720]   Howdy.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.920]   Should have worn my cowgirl hat.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.560]   How y'all?
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.040]   Great, great.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.560]   A little raspy still from the party end, but--
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.160]   Why what?
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   --have to be home, but also great, South Bay.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.160]   It was really fun.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.640]   Also from South by Southwest, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.600]   Jeff and Gina are--
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.000]   Sorry, I'm still waking up for a part.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.920]   Jeff and Gina are our regulars.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.840]   Next week, we will have a special guest from Google.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.560]   But for now, the three of us and lots
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.240]   to talk about in the Googleverse.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.800]   But I guess we should debrief.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.400]   By the way, thank you so much for being part of a Twit
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.040]   on Sunday.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.040]   And if you haven't heard--
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.560]   I always feel good when I graduate to Twit.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.440]   It's not your graduating.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   Exactly.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.600]   I'm about to grow it up's table.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.200]   No, no.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.400]   I want to just say about this week in Google,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.040]   this show is one of our absolute premier shows.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.360]   And it's entirely because of you guys.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   Whoops.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.040]   I just darkened the show.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.720]   Until then.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.120]   Until then, we went black.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.520]   No, it's entirely because of you guys.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.360]   You guys are fantastic.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.680]   And it's one of the reasons the show out of the box,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480]   got such a great audience, is because you have absolute fans.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.680]   Gina for, of course, starting Life Hacker and her great work
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.400]   with Think Up.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.960]   And I have to throw in now to do.txt, which increasingly--
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.880]   Because you're using it.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.380]   Awesome.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.040]   You have to tell you Leo, people tell me,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.120]   I listen to you on Twig.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.600]   I don't hear Life Hacker anymore.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.320]   Oh, that's good.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.280]   Do you want to speak Google?
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.600]   I guess that's good, right?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.440]   And they know about Smart River.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.400]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.280]   Jeff Jarvis, of course, he's a professor of journalism.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.360]   He's an esteemed commentator on the future of journalism.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.920]   And also the author of really one of the best books on Google.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.120]   What would Google do?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.360]   Although now I saw Vaajanathan on CNN touting his new book.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.480]   So his book's finally out.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   See if his book is finally out.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.480]   And Stephen Levy's book, I just got the galley for it.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.560]   Oh, he's the plex.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.640]   He's doing kind of the story of Google.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.640]   Oh, see, he did, of course, the classic soul of a new machine.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   No, that's Tracy Kitter.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.000]   He did Tackers, which really was one of the--
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.120]   that and soul of the new machine were the seminal works
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720]   on the '70s computer scene.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.760]   And so I can't wait to read that.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.360]   And I'll let us book Google.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.320]   So there's a lot of books about Google.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.480]   I'm going to move on.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.600]   Yeah, maybe we should move on.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.200]   His next book, Public Parts, will be out sometime soon.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.920]   And you spoke, didn't you, Jeff, about that very topic
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.200]   at South by Southwest?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.680]   Yeah, I was over the river and through the woods halfway
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.320]   to Dallas.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.000]   But yes.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.720]   Did you get the four square--
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.640]   there's a four square button that's like,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.720]   I can't remember what is far, far out or something.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.640]   Far, far away.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.120]   Far, far away.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.240]   Yeah, you explore Austin outside of the--
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.040]   so really, for some panels, you have to take a shuttle
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.400]   to the hotel across the river.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.320]   Yeah, I did that a couple times.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.400]   Yeah, I was thinking about--
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.160]   It's got time to speak.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   --trying to talk to some people.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.680]   We discussed this somewhere that--
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.480]   I was wondering whether South by 19,000 is the final number,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.600]   19,000 paid participants.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.520]   Wow.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.920]   And should it be cut down?
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   Should it have a cap?
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.840]   And somebody said maybe it was on Twitter.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   Well, then it becomes Ted, which you don't want.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.400]   We don't want an elitist show.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.280]   No.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   But it just doesn't work.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.440]   It's just too big.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.480]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.640]   I think they've got a separate film from Interactive Now.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.840]   Well, and maybe be a little bit more selective in panels.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.960]   I mean, there's so many panels and there's so many tracks
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.880]   that it's a little frustrating because you just can't see.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.520]   Get mad, yes.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.680]   Yeah, you can't see all the ones.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.320]   So if they were--
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.200]   if they cut the number of panels down by 75%,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.320]   it'd also be great if people could express interest
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.160]   in panels beforehand so that they could see--
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.480]   before they schedule them.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.520]   Don't they do that?
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.000]   Don't they have books?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.880]   But know that oh, Gina wants to--
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.320]   this person, user 1, 2, 3, Gina Japoni,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.480]   wants to see these panels.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.120]   Oops.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.400]   Let's not-- a lot of people want to see the same panels.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.720]   Don't schedule them at the same time.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.320]   So a lot.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   There you go.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.760]   Right.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.360]   There is technology to solve this problem.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.640]   lanyard.com, lanyard with 1A was awesome.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.920]   And my coworker, Andy Bea, was like, hey, just go on a lanyard
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.040]   and see which panels your friends are going to.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.680]   And I did that.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.640]   And it was just like it immediately kind of surfaced.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.160]   20 minutes.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.680]   And I was able to-- I had this great list of panels
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.960]   that I wanted to go to.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.680]   And lanyard did a really, really nice job, better
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.840]   than the native-- sorry, South by Southwest,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.000]   but better than the native South by Southwest app.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.880]   That's interesting.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.360]   They had this kind of dedicated--
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.280]   It's a little different than "Plancast."
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.560]   But it's similar in that for that use.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.880]   I haven't used "Plancast" very much.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.560]   So I'm not sure-- it's a lanyard's sort of just--
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   it's conference-specific.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.560]   And you sign in with Twitter so it knows who you follow
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.440]   and who's followed you.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.120]   And you can list yourself as a speaker.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.240]   And you can see where your friends are going.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.440]   And that was really, really helpful for me
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.400]   because I'm out of the loop.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.840]   But my friends are in the loop, so--
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.120]   "Plancast" is all events.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.680]   And lanyard is just conferences.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.480]   So yeah.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.040]   Right.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   Social conferences.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.200]   It just shows you that there's a problem
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.680]   where you wouldn't have software like lanyard.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.600]   Right.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.440]   And I like this link fed up hearing about South by Southwest
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.200]   block tweets from known attendees.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.760]   Now, that's an application that people want.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.160]   Well, of course, you can't block us.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.800]   But we'll stop talking about South by now.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.080]   But I do have to start thinking about it for next year.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.920]   We are talking with them, actually, this week
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.960]   about expanding our participation.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.680]   There's a lot of things we'd like to do.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.880]   One of the things-- the last two years,
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.960]   all we've done is cover the parties because Scoble told me,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.520]   he said, forget the conference.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.800]   Forget the show.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.040]   The parties is where it's at at South by.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.240]   So last year and this year, that was kind of our coverage.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.480]   But I really do want to cover the conferences.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.560]   So what we're going to try to do is
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.840]   work with the organizers to have a stage outside where
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.920]   select conference presenters can come out.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.040]   We can't stream the conference.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.240]   They do that, but can come out and talk to us.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.320]   And we can interview them.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.280]   And I think that would be a--
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.080]   Wouldn't that be a great way to spend a couple of days?
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.960]   Having the crowd, having the people there.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.920]   It was just so great, the venue you found.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.280]   And it was real fans were there.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   Yeah, Momos was great.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.400]   And that was wonderful.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.880]   Just having real people and enthusiastic.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.360]   Yeah, I did not have to promote it too much
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.560]   because I just wanted it to be people who listened to the show
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   so they would know about it.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.040]   And it worked perfectly.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.800]   I would love to have had you stream our session, the Leo.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.280]   Andy organized the worst website ever, which was like seven
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.080]   people pitching their worst possible ideas to a GC.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.440]   It was Dave McClure.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.880]   And he funded us with $5 the winner.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   It was hilarious.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.200]   We had the ballroom just at Rokus laughter.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.920]   It was awesome.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.560]   And everyone was asking us, you know, kids, they're video.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.880]   And we're going to try and get a video up.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.600]   And I would have loved to have had you live stream.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.200]   That was one of the coolest panels I've ever been on.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.000]   It was really fun.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.200]   Well, doesn't South Bay do some-- most conference organizers
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.680]   will do something.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.600]   Well, so they live stream the keynotes, which was great.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.440]   But like the individual panels, you know, we actually
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.160]   did our panel twice because the first room was so small,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.920]   we had a line to the escalator.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.160]   So they said, OK, well, we have-- you know, that was at 11am.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.520]   They said, oh, we have a bigger room for you.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.040]   You can redo it again at 5pm.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.960]   So we can accommodate everyone.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.000]   So, you know, it was just--
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.800]   it was one of those things.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.560]   It was the most popular event on Lanyard.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.120]   So we knew a lot of people were going to come.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.240]   We didn't want to turn them away at the door.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.720]   But we had to do that the first time.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.600]   So it was just one of those things,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.160]   like we knew it was going to be a good panel South.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.000]   I didn't.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.360]   And like, it was just like, ah, I wish we could have streamed this.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.720]   But, you know, we had somebody with a handicam in the first row.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.840]   So we did get some video.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.960]   Oh, we could do better than that.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.440]   So Eileen is sitting here.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.440]   And we are going to talk--
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.560]   we have a conference call with the organizers, literally,
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.400]   in the next few days.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.480]   They didn't want to talk until after was over.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.280]   But planning for next year.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.920]   And, you know, that's a great idea.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.160]   If we would know ahead of time-- and I think with your help,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.240]   we would-- what the really, you know, five of the best panels,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.600]   and they would let us stream those, that would be awesome.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.760]   You got to find the panels that are funny.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.720]   Like, that take a different--
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.480]   that aren't just people sitting at a table going,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.240]   want, want, want, want.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.200]   You know, they're really kind of--
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.160]   So a lot of that, right?
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.960]   Yeah, they're really lively ones.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.720]   That would be great.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.480]   Yeah, I'd like to do that.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   Well, the great thing you can do, too,
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.360]   is you don't just stream the stage.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.040]   You use your cameras to go around and Oprah the room.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.080]   Yes, right.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.520]   Because you do it to the whole town.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.120]   You know how to do that now.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.280]   So you could do that with the room,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.480]   where you really bring in the funniness.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.840]   You know, the funny folks--
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   It's a good verb, by the way, the Oprah the room.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.920]   And we know how much Jeff loves Oprah.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.360]   I'm going to Oprah the room.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.600]   And no, I think we will--
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.120]   we will grow a bit more.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.200]   We're getting more-- each time getting a little more ambitious.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.560]   I mean, last I remember was just me, a staff, and a camera.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.840]   I walked around.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.800]   I didn't have a cameraman.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.240]   I was just me, you know, walking around--
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.520]   Well, then Leo, you have the other problem
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.880]   having the one person crowd surfing, the six person crowd
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.240]   surfing.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.280]   Now what do we do?
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.560]   I think the tattoo is the only way to go.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.720]   I was hoping that I can do something a little ago on your ass.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.960]   I want the twig look on your ass.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.200]   We should have a bet.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.280]   We should have a bet.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.760]   We'll figure out something.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.720]   So let us talk a little bit about what's going on in the world
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.600]   outside of South by Southwest.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.760]   Yes, there is a world outside of Austin, believe it or not.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.120]   Although, really, the geek world and the cloud world
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.320]   did converge on Austin.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.760]   I have to say, I learned a lot.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.200]   Did anybody go to the Google Hackhouse party?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.880]   That's how I knew that South by Southwest
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.680]   I got into big.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.440]   Normally, when Google holds events at conferences,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:19.800]   like this--
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.120]   Huge.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.480]   --you know, it's top of my list.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.880]   And it's the first thing I--
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.600]   I didn't make it to any Google events.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.920]   I felt terrible.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.440]   Jeff, did you make it to any of the Google events?
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.280]   They were pretty--
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.400]   I had a big presence.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.600]   Events were so over-subscribed.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.560]   These parties are so over-subscribed
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   that many of these parties had competitions
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.600]   to get into the party.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.400]   The four-square party you couldn't get into,
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.160]   unless you did a--
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.480]   it was crazy.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.680]   And I don't know.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.960]   So I'm just looking at all the things they did.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.480]   They had on Sunday, which we missed,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.800]   was the League of Extraordinary Hackers from 1 to 6.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.080]   They had 15-minute API briefings on Android, Chrome, HTML5,
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.200]   Blogger, Google TV, Google Maps, App Engine, YouTube,
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.560]   Web fonts, cell bots, and Fusion Tables.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.000]   What?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Whoa.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.880]   You know, I'm just not in the developer mindset
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.160]   when I go to South by Southwest.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.640]   I'm just not in the like, I want to learn the Chrome API.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.680]   It's like--
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.960]   We missed that because we were working.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.160]   But then we could have gone a super happy dev house,
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.000]   complete with hacking in a LEGO Mindstorms,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.640]   Sumo Bot competition.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.680]   Wow.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.200]   You know what?
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.360]   I need more cameras and more hosts.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.560]   We're going to have to do a four-way screen,
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.800]   where you pick what party you want to be.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.440]   It's just incredible.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.400]   But then on the other hand, a party is a party is a party.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   Right.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.200]   Right.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.440]   Yeah, you're going deaf.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.120]   You're then going to lose your voice.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.680]   You're going to fight to get one drink.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.960]   You're going to scream at us all day.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.520]   That's what I think to be honest.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360]   No, you're right.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.480]   No, you're right.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.560]   That's why, to be honest, I thought next year,
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.880]   we try to capture at least some of the session content,
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.960]   which we have not been--
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.920]   I think session content-- and I think the fact
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.560]   that you go to Dignation, the fact
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.400]   that you are now going to have a show of similar--
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.560]   Parties with content are pretty great.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.120]   Well, I don't think--
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.560]   [SIGHS]
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.480]   We don't even know what we're going to do next year
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   for our shows, but I guess we have to do a show.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.520]   I don't want to do stuff.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.560]   I don't do what Dignation does.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.160]   That's 2,000 people.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.840]   Yours was great.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.600]   Mole was great.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.040]   I like what we did because it was like family.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.520]   But next year, everybody knows about it,
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.920]   so next year, you're going to make it big.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.840]   I don't want to make it big.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.160]   But anyway, we'll figure out somewhere.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.800]   No, I was thinking, too, that nobody will get off
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.240]   stuff I thought of us because I know most of the world
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.400]   is sick of it.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.680]   But I wasn't there.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.920]   I'm tired of hearing about it.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.960]   But if they split up theater and interactive,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.400]   they could also use the theaters to do some really neat stuff.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:57.920]   Oh, right.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.760]   If they separate film, yep, yep.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.200]   That's a good idea.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   Actually, that's operating that the three is a really good idea.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.400]   Wasn't this year the first year the interactive was bigger
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.560]   than film or music, which isn't just the last year?
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.480]   Last year was bigger.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.760]   And this year was gigantic.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.000]   So Google has, once again, done its crisis response page.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.680]   This has become kind of just automatic from Google.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.640]   If you go to google.com/crisisresponse,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.120]   there have been awful lot of crises in the world.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.960]   And of course, Japan is the latest.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.440]   And I think they're doing a spectacular job now of this.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.680]   Yeah, they've got this down, right?
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.200]   They've got it down.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   They roll this out right away.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.960]   And honestly, I mean, not to be cynical,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.640]   but Google needs to do this to show
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.120]   that they have real time tools that can help people,
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.040]   that aren't Twitter.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.560]   Because all you hear about this with these things,
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.880]   you hear about Twitter a lot.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.280]   People found out through Twitter.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.360]   People first--
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.720]   eyewitness accounts, that kind of thing.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.960]   So Google's got to get into the game.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.560]   What I really like about Google's tools
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.800]   is that there's a direct help kind of situation
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.960]   where you can find-- finding people and seeing maps
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.720]   and adding names and looking for names.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.800]   That's very useful, maybe more useful
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.400]   than seeing a stream of news going by.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.560]   That's where people experiencing the issue.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.600]   Well, this has both.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.960]   And that's what's kind of intriguing.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.600]   You can click this link that says latest news.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.560]   At the very bottom, they have real time updates,
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.640]   which aren't updating yet, but they will.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.840]   Those are mostly tweets.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.480]   They have a latest-- it's really a dashboard.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   Live streaming from NHK, maps.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.940]   They have all sorts of updated links, rolling power
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.680]   blackouts, embassy resources if you're stuck in Japan.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.000]   And then I like this right at the top, a way to donate,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.360]   which I think is so fantastic, to either the Japanese Red
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.680]   Cross Society, UNICEF, or Save the Children.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.000]   And I think that makes it very easy.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.960]   That's using Google Checkout to donate.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.200]   Everybody's doing that, though.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.720]   I was really pleased to see Apple with their iTunes.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.920]   It's right on the front page.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.400]   It couldn't be easier to donate.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.680]   And you do it right through the iTunes.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.720]   And Apple doesn't take its normal 30%.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.280]   I presume Google also waves its cut from Google Checkout.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.640]   So to tech community, we read on the Mac Break Weekly
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.920]   yesterday an email that was sent to Kevin Rose
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.680]   from a listener up to this show and to many of the Twitch
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.560]   shows as well, because he mentions them.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.480]   Who was at Apple, a Japan employee,
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.320]   and talked about what they did in the Apple stores.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.360]   They said, Tokyo doesn't have much open Wi-Fi.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.000]   Many people come to the Apple stores to use the Wi-Fi.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.080]   So we stayed open till 10 PM that night.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.200]   We put chargers out as many as we could find.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.400]   So people would charge their phones
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.520]   because there was no power.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.840]   This isn't Tokyo.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   That's great.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.320]   People were actually spending the night there
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.600]   who couldn't get home.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.000]   Yeah, it was pretty neat.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.760]   I'm sure other companies responded similarly.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.280]   I'm sure Google Japan responded similarly.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.480]   I just think I think it's really great.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.800]   It's, you know, as we said it on Twitch,
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.600]   every technology comes of age, you know,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.760]   the next disaster supposedly.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.240]   But, you know, watching the many ways that we get news now here
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.960]   is just amazing.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.480]   I've talked about Andy Carvin like crazy.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.000]   By the way, I'm going to be at NPR next week.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.360]   Oh, good.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.160]   Maybe I can, maybe I can, maybe I can come in for a few minutes.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.880]   Oh, would you please?
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.800]   You know, he gave a panel.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.720]   Again, this is another one I missed at South by.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.320]   He gave a panel.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.480]   I would have loved to have seen that.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.560]   Yeah, he's just great.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.280]   He's just wonderful.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   He was doing Japan.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.080]   But all the other sources, the fact that I can,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.720]   I've been going nuts watching NHK, which they,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   the Japanese network, and they put a live translator on TV.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.480]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.880]   It's on Ustream.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.480]   Well, that's what he said.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.840]   People in the Apple store were going into watch Ustream.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.520]   Yeah, that's where they were getting their news.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.280]   I think that's exactly.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.560]   So just for the, for the, for the records,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.240]   it's Ustreamed.tv/channel/NHK-world-TV.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:54.520]   And it's striking how different the coverage is versus America.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.800]   And cable news, it is so much more information packed
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.240]   and so less emotional.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.080]   Believe it or not, they're living through this.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.240]   And we're the ones going crazy.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.440]   And they don't go crazy with the fancy graphics and all that.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.920]   They sometimes just hold up a big cardboard thing
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.640]   with the map of the area or map of the reactor.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.240]   And they explain it and they go through long stories.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.120]   It's very impressive and amazing to be
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.080]   able to see it from there.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.040]   No kidding.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.760]   So Andy Carvin, as we mentioned before,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.960]   will say it again, A. Carvin on Twitter.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   And he's doing a kind of a curation as he has in the past
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.000]   with other events, major world events like the Egypt
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.680]   Revolution and Tunisia and Haiti before that.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.240]   He's doing his own little curation, which is fantastic.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.600]   And I can't believe still only 33,000 followers.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.680]   Meanwhile, you know, Charlie Sheen's got two million.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.480]   It's like, come on, please.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.200]   Give me a break.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.600]   It's wrong with the world.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:55.120]   And as you mentioned, NHK-world-TV on Ustream for their live.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:01.840]   And actually, they also point to the main fetus
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.880]   well from NHK.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.920]   I don't see anything right there.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.120]   You found any great resources on the technology side of this?
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.560]   Well, the big story for, I think, for us as technologists
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.000]   is the nuclear plants.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.840]   Trying to get-- it's really tough.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.360]   Trying to get--
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.960]   I think you got a link earlier to the MIT.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.600]   I did.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.400]   Now, that's-- Slate has deprecated that post saying
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.920]   that guy is not a nuclear engineer,
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.600]   although I think that the folks at MIT in nuclear engineering
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.440]   probably, in fact, I know, amended his post
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   and vetted it for accuracy.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.600]   So I tend to trust that post.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.080]   And then we also had a link to nrc.gov,
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.960]   where they have a lot of teaching material,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   the Nuclear Regulatory Council, on how those version 1GE
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.600]   boiler reactors work.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.400]   But it's hard to get unbiased information.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.880]   A lot of the news networks want to sensationalize it,
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.040]   like it's the end of the world.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.840]   And then pro-Nuke people are minimizing it.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.480]   And I just-- I'm on the fence on Nuke,
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   and I'd like to get that information so we
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.240]   could make an intelligent choice.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.160]   And that's apparently not too easy to do.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.200]   So it's-- yeah, I want to-- we're probably--
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.560]   I think this is in our portfolio,
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.080]   do something on the network to try to get some unbiased--
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.120]   That's a good idea, Leo.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   Yeah, it is.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.480]   There it is.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.640]   Technical information on the air.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.880]   Non-easy to do, I might add, because everybody
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.960]   seems to have something-- a dog in this hunt.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.320]   Let's move on to some Google News.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.600]   Chrome, a big winner in two ways.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.480]   It survived the Pwnedown attempts to hack it.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.080]   Actually, there were no attempts,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   which I thought was very interesting.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.680]   Canada's CanSec West, a security conference
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.400]   that's held every year, has a traditional Pwnedown
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.560]   festival in which hackers attack browsers and operating
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.040]   systems and lately mobile devices.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.000]   They come prepared with their hacks.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.120]   We should point out they don't just sit down on a computer
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.400]   and say, let me see if I can hack this.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.200]   Of course, the company is now aware of this.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.480]   Put out patches right before Apple put up
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.680]   some big dozens of patches for Safari.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.200]   And still, Safari got hacked within five seconds.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.920]   Chrome-- the Chrome Norfirefox was hacked at all,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.200]   despite the fact that Google put out
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.760]   an additional $20,000 reward to the person who hacked it.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.960]   Nobody attempted, which I take to mean nobody had a hack.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.960]   Yeah, that doesn't mean no one tried.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.520]   They tried before the event and said,
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.360]   we're not wasting our time on that.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.960]   Yeah, so Google was paying $20,000
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.760]   to someone who successfully hacked.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.000]   Yeah, so you would get-- anyway, you'd get $40,000.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.960]   I think you get $15,000 and a laptop if you succeed.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.360]   And Google said, we'll sweeten the pot
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.800]   and still nobody attempted, which is a pretty big pot.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.560]   Yeah, that's a pretty good bounty.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.760]   I would say that that is evidence there was, in fact,
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.960]   no known hack.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.600]   Right.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.160]   Firefox was hacked.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.760]   That those hackers could find.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.360]   Yeah, now I'm not sure that Android--
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.960]   I think Android got through as well.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.760]   Let me just see, Pwn, 2-0.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   And this is a really-- a great event.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.160]   It looks like Android might have been hacked.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.760]   Oh, that was 2008, never mind.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.760]   Yes, in 2008, Android was hacked.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.560]   But it's interesting because a lot of these--
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.560]   a lot of these operating systems or browsers are now much more
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.560]   hardened than they were a few years ago.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.560]   Thanks to Pwn to own.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.560]   Thanks to Pwn to own, exactly.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   Although a number-- Charlie Miller,
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   who's the guy who traditionally hacks Safari didn't this time,
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   but traditionally is one that award,
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.560]   said there is a negative side of this.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   Hackers will hold off on revealing exploits
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   so that they can use them.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.560]   Right.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.560]   Did any other companies screen the pot?
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.560]   Like Google did?
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   No.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560]   Certainly not Microsoft.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.560]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.560]   It's interesting.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.560]   Google--
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   Yeah, it's interesting that perspective
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.560]   that you're doing as a service versus--
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.560]   Right.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   --the other way around.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.560]   So-- oh, $20,000 and a CR48 laptop.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.560]   Ooh.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   Now you're cooking.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   Well, those are about to get scarce, aren't they?
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   Are they?
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   They giving up on those?
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.560]   Yeah, it looks like we have a story in the list here.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   They shipped the last CR48 for now.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560]   Quote, unquote.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   Well, that probably means that we'll see actual
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   commercial versions of the Chrome OS, yes?
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   Right.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   Yep.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   This summer, I guess, a gadget reporting.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   Okay.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   That's cool.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.560]   I have my CR48.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   I just saw it the other day.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   I waved at it.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560]   Hi.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.560]   How are you?
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   Good to see you.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   I should probably see if there's updates.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.560]   I don't know.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   It doesn't compel.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.560]   Yeah, I'm thinking about maybe offering it as a bounty for ThinkUp.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   There you go.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   You want another one?
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   Yes.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   You can have two.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   Yes.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   I would love that.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   We shall discuss that offline.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   Why is it sitting there?
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.560]   You'll be making the government better with your CR48.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   Think of it that way.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   It's about time.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   Partner Chrome OS devices on track for summer.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:27.560]   Google rumor, according to a gadget, rumor had it had 60,000 CR48s made in December.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   And that number frilly depleted.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560]   They were pretty.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.560]   They were very free with them.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.460]   anybody could apply and say I want one and I never got one you never got one or
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.840]   what do you mind you should have mine yeah yeah I'll play with it instead of
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:48.080]   ocean you first and then yes it's certainly worth playing with because
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.020]   it's it's not it was never intended to be a product it was only intended to
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.100]   demonstrate chroma OS and beta tested and I know they've been pushing out a lot
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:01.020]   of fixes over time yeah they have they have they have this definitely updated I
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.860]   use it every once in a while and there's and once in a while I do get the hey we
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.020]   start the update you got they had a problem with the trackpad which they
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:17.060]   fixed yeah yeah show anyway did it work easily with printers and all I don't know
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:23.220]   I didn't know I actually never tried to print from it you're so I did it by
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:31.940]   what you're asking work with printers no I believe the steam engine was not
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.780]   needed actually I didn't I should try cloud print though right that's why they
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:43.620]   built right yeah yeah what we'll do is I will autograph it in the silver pen I'll
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.980]   send it to you Jeff you autograph it in the silver pen and we'll send it to Gina
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:52.620]   and they'll have the twig crew nice yeah it'll be a collector's item let's do
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:58.420]   that's cool Krista Bona is gonna be a next week I can get him to autograph it
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:05.100]   too awesome Google VP lays down multiple stats is that a number of the week I
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:17.100]   don't want to interrupt you know I looked at her I thought that's a guy what am I
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:23.540]   not what is wrong with me no I I believe I can tell nowadays she has long hair
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:29.500]   no that's not anyway she says a South by Southwest Marissa spoke she said map
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:36.780]   service 150 million is that 150 million unique yeah I think so wow can
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:43.900]   according to a million miles 12 billion miles Wow that is crazy the late it's
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.780]   the latest build the app saves people an average of two days worth of travel
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.940]   time per year I have to say Google's I love Google's so great at that at
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.540]   breaking down the amount of you know minute seconds hours that things like
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.100]   Chrome they did the same kind of stat when they launched the Chrome instant
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.940]   instant results right didn't she say it saves save searchers like an hour a
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.980]   week or something they do that's I mean speed is obviously Google's main focus
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.740]   but that's the way to tell the story I love it yeah of course they'd be good at
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.700]   metrics right obviously you talked to a Marissa last week we had to let you
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:23.220]   go early yeah it was good I had Marissa and Tim Armstrong up there and Tim did
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.220]   not back away from the AOL way Marissa described a future of content which
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.340]   really you know takes the thing I've talked about in the past of the the
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.860]   hyper personal news stream and really has a vision for where targeting is gonna
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:41.940]   go and a lot of discussion about quality and improving quality you know new
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.660]   algorithm and stuff like that when you use the word targeting I think that
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.060]   might bother some people that's you know it's coming you know it's coming
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.940]   Google has such a good sense in their own minds of as does Facebook of the
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:01.260]   value of it and then they don't fully understand the creeped out people out
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:07.500]   here well what is targeting what does that mean you know if if Google prioritizes
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.300]   your inbox today imagine if Google can prioritize all your feeds right so you
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.260]   have your Twitter feeds and your links and your email and your RSS and they know
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.620]   enough about you to know what you care about and so that they just say here Leo
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:27.620]   do this hmm that could be high value hmm but they know a lot of they got lots
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.140]   of signals that what matters to you and who you're talking to and when and why
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.180]   and you're getting value back so it's worth doing I mean I couldn't live
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:40.140]   without priority inbox now is the trick to do it without creeping people out
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.740]   yeah the trick to do it is is by being very open and the political end of this
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.260]   is difficult you know I think Obama is about to announce the FTC is about to
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:55.020]   announce tomorrow a do not track law and just tries me nutty because we don't
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.980]   need it we have it we have the ability to drop cookies anything we want it's a
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.500]   stupid way but as as as often been pointed out to me the fact that do not
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.980]   call got right 180 million Americans or some such and if anything called do not
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:16.340]   today is gonna pass in Washington yeah do not do not read laws and you know
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:23.460]   so is it I have this antipathy towards marketers obviously every but I imagine
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.620]   everybody does but is that really reasonable I mean they'll be isn't marketing
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.700]   yeah it's isn't it kind of critical isn't it the grease that lubricates our
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.420]   economic machine maybe I wrote this you know paragraph and the book saying you
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.460]   know you can cut all these things out you can get ghostry and find out who
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.740]   tracks you you can go to a incandino session you can kill your cookies this
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.540]   is all in your power today and that's fine it's your it's your right and
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.900]   privilege and you can do it but when you do that you have lowered your value to
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.740]   the site you're coming to and you may be pushing them at some point if enough
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:03.460]   people do this over the edge to either open a pay wall because they have to that
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.900]   how much do you like that folks or certainly put up just really junky ads
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:13.020]   that's the immediate or even die yeah and so there's a responsibility here I
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:19.500]   think and and you know yeah I fast forward through TV ads to and so and I
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.380]   ignore lots of ads to and the I put the blame on the advertising industry for
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.420]   doing stupid ads that don't think immediate for selling too many of them
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.220]   and not being relevant not being engagement but that's the whole point if
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.580]   it's going to be better advertising the way it's going to be better is
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:41.260]   targeting right in the EU I put up this on the list they this week are going to
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.140]   come out with you know this this panic goes on somewhat related they're going
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:59.220]   to have a right to be forgotten I don't even get his best in in Germany who
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.020]   is he he did the anti-streetview thing where people find the
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.940]   the pixelated houses yeah he tweeted me where I was in here he said they're
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.700]   confused right to be deleted in social networks okay right to be forgotten means
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   delete everything about me online that's bad in lots of ways and that
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.260]   potentially violates if I write about you and you can come along and tell me to
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:31.340]   erase you that that's a violation of my freedom of speech right so this mania
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.580]   I mean the mania is doing great things for the book it'll you know be a good
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.180]   topic by the time September comes around but but it bothers me greatly that
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.340]   we're going overboard on some of these things because there's this this mania
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:49.340]   yeah I like the right to not what it not exist
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:55.500]   yeah and like have me just sort of disappear after a while there's no it's
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.140]   not technologically feasible however well what it amounts to is that is that as
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.580]   part of the TOS for Facebook you would be required to guarantee that you could
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.780]   erase someone from the service right though you're still right there fine you
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.340]   could erase my account but can you erase everything that somebody said about me
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.300]   can you raise every photo I'm in can you erase every link to me this is how
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.660]   you can delete your Facebook account but if anybody has referred to a picture in
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.580]   that account it stays because it's part of their collection now no man is an
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.820]   island right and let's not forget the I don't know if you're wearing a war but
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:37.180]   that's a whole this way you're perhaps are talking about the eyelids of longer
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.780]   hunts let us I don't know where that came where did that come from that was
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.820]   just something gets a very deep quiz in my mind how often have you had
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:53.460]   structured therapy it's just bought out so let's take a break up when we come
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:32:02.900]   back it is the rebirth of Google wave or is it a very happy G to trip by the
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:09.580]   living tech will find out exactly what that means in just a second before we do
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:15.940]   though I'd like to tell everybody about go to meeting go to meeting of course
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.460]   that great software from our friends at Citrix that makes it possible for you
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:25.140]   not to hit the road if you're just back now from South by Southwest probably
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:29.300]   the last thing you'd want to do is is get back on a plane for a client meeting
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.900]   and yet so many of us spend so much time for those face-to-face meetings wouldn't
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.660]   be great if there was some sort of system like I don't know the internet that
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.500]   would allow you to have your meetings online yes there is in fact you probably
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.620]   know there's quite a few online meeting solutions but none easier none better
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:49.060]   than go to meeting if you haven't tried it I do want you to try it
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.900]   meetings costs you know a lot of time a lot of money and a lot there's a lot of
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:58.260]   stress in flying places so we do teleconferences but they're not perfect
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.380]   people get bored you know we've been doing lately if we still do tell a lot
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.940]   of teleconferences but we set them up with go to meeting it's nice because it's
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.380]   built into go to meeting it's free you get teleconferencing via VoIP which means
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:15.140]   you can use it on the iPad or by phone or both so we set up a teleconference
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.740]   you know it's built in that I'll look at the click of the mouse very simple but
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.500]   we also have the go to meeting in the background we don't always use it but if
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.420]   I suddenly say oh you know let me show you I could turn it on and they see it
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.580]   very easy for clients to use people who've never used it before a lot of other
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.820]   people are you know maybe still using maybe those crappy Microsoft
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:38.740]   meetings software Adobe has stuff you know I just say you know click this link
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.420]   boom 30 seconds later they've got go to meeting on there and they universally
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.740]   they say wow this is much easier much better I didn't need to call the IT
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.180]   department for sales presentations for product demos for training for
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.100]   collaboration again you're in a meeting you say I got this document can we work
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.180]   on this together fantastic I even you know a couple of years ago and this was
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.500]   so cool rehearsed a presentation with somebody with two people in two different
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:07.180]   spots we had a PowerPoint presentation it was like 60 tips in 60 minutes so it
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.900]   had to really move we were able to rehearse it on go to meeting it was
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.740]   incredible brought to you by Citrix so you know it's secure 128 bit SSL it's
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.420]   cross-platform Mac and Windows and yes on the iPad it's spectacular and as many
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.060]   meetings as you want for as long as you want just forty nine dollars try it
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:29.500]   free right now go to go to meeting dot com slash twig 30 days free you be the
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:38.220]   judge go to meeting dot com slash twig so Gina we are using a new Google Doc
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:46.420]   feature that is very wave like it is very wave like just got comments real
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.980]   time live comments within the entire document and within sections of the
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.620]   document and it's it's pretty cool and it's very very wave like it doesn't have
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.460]   the chaos anarchy thing that wave had which was that you can you can't edit
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.700]   other people's comments right which you used to be able to do and wave but you
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.980]   can comment you can reply to their com you can you can edit the document that
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.820]   you're worth working on which is some ways better right right exactly so the
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.180]   idea comments is just to have this side conversation about what's going on in
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.380]   the document or in a section of the document without actually you know changing
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:21.420]   the document itself now Doc's had chat you know the sidebar chat on on the side
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.300]   which was nice we use that from time to time yeah we have used that Eileen and
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   and you know just as we edit the the doc for the show beforehand but comments
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.180]   because you can do comments within a particular section you can have
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:37.020]   discussions which are separate you can delete discussions after you've had them
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.340]   okay this discussion has been resolved right not delete it but kind of close
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.620]   it off it's a really it's a nice new feature I love this right like I get I
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:48.740]   have to draft documents all the time documentation proposals this kind of
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.020]   thing and when you work you're remotely like I do this this kind of thing is
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.220]   huge is a part of the reason why I loved wave so I'm excited I feel like I feel
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.700]   heartened that this this is kind of you know something you know lesson learned
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.580]   or a good feature from wave that came into Doc's I think they did a pretty good
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.460]   job with it I haven't had a whole lot of time to play with it I've been playing
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:10.220]   with you guys and the doc that we're sharing right now and it also has this
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.580]   and this is one of wave's fatal mistakes is that wave launched without email
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.020]   notifications so you would wave someone but you'd never know if they waved you
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:22.100]   back this new discussions feature in Doc's you can set email notifications for
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.460]   various things if someone replies back or starts a new discussion or you can
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.500]   turn them off completely which is super nice it's a the button is you have to
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.780]   open up a Google Doc and then the but there's a discussions button up near
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:37.820]   share that's just discussions and see I'll zoom in on it so you can see it it's
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.020]   right up here by the way we found this right away you can change it so it
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:47.940]   doesn't email you because Jeff said I'm getting a bunch emails so you can turn
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.660]   that off it's actually quite granular if you click the discussions button then
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:56.980]   the discussions opens up in light blue it's a a my my my my my my my my my my
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.700]   but I also notice Gino that there's a little yellow post it note when we've
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.620]   got a conversation you and me going off to the right as well so it and I can I
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.420]   have the capability responding editing deleting and resolving yeah that's
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   actually that's a selection conversation so I selected a couple of words and then
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:19.060]   right clicked and chose comments right I'm gonna add another one so she'll do it
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.180]   right now well this is all in real time so we're watching you as you do it
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:27.220]   right so that should come up and I believe that that the the little post it
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.060]   notes should sort of should match the color of the highlighted section so I
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.540]   can see yes they do I could see those little red markers that Gina put I don't
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.100]   know if you can see them let me zoom in a little bit more Gina put that there and
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.020]   then Gina put this here and so if you if you if you write I think if you right
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.580]   click and hit comment you can see you should be able to see the the comment
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:55.620]   yeah so I like this I for listen for groups that have to work on documents
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.860]   together this is huge talk about revision so much better than Microsoft word
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:04.660]   revision tracking I mean really real-time commenting yes but but a very clear
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:09.180]   metaphor to work vision tracking which I think people can understand like have
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.260]   this mental model of a lot better right that that was waves problems that no one
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.020]   it was like a product that solved the solution you know that had a solution
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.300]   for people who use mailing lists and wikis a lot and not a lot of people do
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.020]   that and there wasn't a clear a clear parallel and I think this is a very
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.100]   clear parallel to word track changes but it has you know it's but it's even
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.380]   better it's real time and it's in the cloud-based so I dig it I really dig it
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:37.380]   hey that's great wave now we don't have the wave plug-in architecture and all
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.540]   that although I don't see any reason why they wouldn't necessarily bring that
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.420]   back I would love to see something like that but that that was a tough you know
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.780]   that was a tough thing you know gmail has labs but only Google employees can add
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.300]   labs I mean the dream would be you know a lab section or an extra
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.380]   feature third party yeah third developers could could and they haven't
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.420]   they haven't really done that wave was really the only platform that allowed
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:03.140]   for that for that kind of thing so this is a tough problem to solve and I think
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.340]   you know you really have to get developers pulled in building really
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.580]   cool stuff to sell that so I think I was interested can't you tie that is it
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:15.860]   easier to tie that now into the apps marketplace that you know that's a
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.260]   really good that's a good point right yeah the apps marketplace is actually
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.620]   that really good point a way to sort of integrate with with Google apps and
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:30.380]   yeah let's compare it yeah I mean it makes it especially if you can make
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.740]   money right make money so good people people like to make money I'll never
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:39.860]   understand why yeah it's interesting yeah cool I'm glad it's back there's a
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:45.860]   video on YouTube that that that I guess demonstrates it if you want yeah the
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:52.940]   video is pretty good yeah so only 305 people have looked at it so far
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:59.740]   but actually the video is kind of cute it's got a it has wave coolies I'll go to
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.660]   the high-def version we can watch it
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:11.100]   it's got jazz everybody loves jazz yeah so that's a good demo if you want to
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:17.740]   know more about that yep yeah and you can at email addresses so people can get
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.860]   notification that you've addressed them inside of a dock which is nice yeah so
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:28.780]   gears is dead long live gears or something I'm confused Google gears yeah
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.540]   well it was dying before but it's officially dead now yes it's officially
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.980]   dead now yeah I mean this is I think maybe we'll look back and see this is the
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.980]   dark age of like when we knew what offline looked like because of gears but
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.620]   we didn't have it because you know HTML5 was on the horizon I guess they just
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.660]   pulled gears gears is now officially completely out of chrome it hasn't been
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.660]   around for a while but it doesn't support IE9 or the Firefox 4 which I
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.020]   think is scheduled to drop next week so yeah gears is gears is gone it's you
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.220]   know it's I wish I think it's probably really hurt Google Docs and maybe even
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.300]   Gmail in the browser to not have offline capabilities I think they could
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:08.220]   have made the right decision to go with HTML5 and not this sort of hacky
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.540]   extension thing but it's also been a really long time I think they sunset
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:17.020]   gears in May of 2010 and they're talking about HTML5 offline capability at the
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.700]   end of this year so that's a long time what does that take so long is it
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:27.380]   not that complex is it I it's a good question I I'm not sure if it's an issue
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.780]   of this standard not being totally fleshed out or what I would love to hear
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.540]   that the the backstory on this I think Seth last week when we had Seth on we
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.340]   asked him about it and he said yeah I'm frustrated too but he said that it
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:42.140]   would come but just it would sound there yeah yeah it's taking a while so and of
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.980]   end of maybe end of this year and every this year but if you're gonna if you're
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.260]   gonna push Chrome OS and you don't have some sort of offline storage that thing
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.900]   is practically useless to me you get an airplane right yes that's the
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:42:00.700]   problem there are still I found out airplanes that don't have Wi-Fi crazy
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:07.020]   tell me about continental I was on JetBlue I said where's the Wi-Fi no they're
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.980]   like no here's your one-way TV you're gonna watch TV though you want TV
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.700]   you got 40 channels of direct TV what's wrong I got a pay six bucks for that
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:18.820]   yeah it's really interesting I mean of course the airline industries in crisis
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.700]   but it's really interesting how what was the latest greatest technology three
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.500]   years ago is now suddenly seems out of date these airplanes it's hard to keep
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:33.260]   them up to date it's a big expense and the airlines don't have a lot so I thought
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.460]   this might I you know I keep saying this I'm one of these days I'll learn I
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:41.980]   thought maybe it's South by Southwest Google would announce Google me which
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:46.700]   now we think according to read right web is Google circles that story got
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:54.840]   repudiated and not so on a places not so oh well so traditionally South by
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.180]   Southwest has been a great place to launch social stuff Twitter four square
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.540]   go Walla nobody stood out this year and I thought maybe this would be a chance
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:08.780]   for Google to say hey we're here not a good way to set up this year say again
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.660]   Apple soon up this year Apple right well the iPad because of the iPad oh I got all
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:19.460]   the they didn't stand up out they popped up they popped up I don't think
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.580]   South by Southwest is the right place to launch a startup anymore don't don't
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.660]   launch your startup it's out it's just too big it's too crazy there's too many
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.820]   there's too many similar competing things going at the same time you know
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.020]   I'm sure I'm like a little young for Google to launch at Google I owe I sat
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.820]   behind your my all young on the plane back and he said something I thought was
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:40.220]   absolutely true said the barrier to entry so low now that there are hundreds of
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:46.060]   startups it's too easy anybody with a nickel it's start up a site right it's
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.100]   just too easy and so as a result you don't have you know there's too many and
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:54.380]   no one's gonna stand head and shoulders above the rest read right web and we're
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.780]   gonna get Christmasina on I not next week I think it's Chris de Mona but
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:04.460]   Christmasina maybe on the week after according to this read right web article
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:10.420]   Christmasina is is one of the big guys involved he of course Gans went to
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:16.340]   Christmasina and he denied it utterly I guess I'm gonna be launched at South
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:21.620]   by Southwest I declined to comment on the story it says oh and that's what
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:26.220]   that's what Marshall Kirkpatrick is saying and read right away but Chris of
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:32.460]   course you know with you know he's he's hashtags he started bar camp he's very
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.180]   open source guy he's the kind of guy if they're gonna do something I would
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:41.900]   really like to see them certainly incorporate his input I saw Rick Cloud
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.220]   who wasn't trying to profile go who got profiles launched we were gonna get
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:49.740]   Rick on what he said as soon as I'm not busy I guess he's now moved to YouTube
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.940]   interesting mmm was taught mine you know what nice I love it yeah very nice
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:00.620]   guy's guy Google acquired him along with his feed burner service Jonathan
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.940]   Sposato who was with picnic another Google acquisition last year is also
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:11.540]   reportedly working on circles yeah actually Chris did say I don't know what
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.660]   the story is talking about so there was a total utter denial it wasn't just not
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.260]   here but maybe later it was these stories keep surfacing though if if none of
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:25.700]   this is if this is true why are we keep hearing these stories are people like
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:30.820]   playing Marshall and other bloggers
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:36.900]   the beam yeah I don't know I mean I think yeah I'm not sure I don't know why
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.860]   everyone wants Google to launch another social product after Buzz I think one
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.260]   of the reasons that the the buzz got big on this was because of the real
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.980]   relaunched profiles right really does look much more it's cleaner and it looks
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.420]   much more as we talked about last week like a Facebook page because it's got
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.540]   you know relationship status and things like that and there's also a link to
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.540]   your profile in the drop down like if you look at the if the new Google toolbar
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.860]   when you look when you're at Google.com and logged in if you click on the drop
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.020]   down there's a link to your profile right there which is pretty prime real
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:15.660]   estate there also there's a lot of chatter about blogger and you know have
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:18.340]   you looked at blogger lately and look at all the big new features and blogger it
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.620]   really seems like they're sort of pushing their more social products you
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.140]   know well there's where that goes from the other side here is that Facebook got
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:31.500]   a patent for patent for curated that is to say social search that's on the on
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:36.380]   the list Leo patent for Q okay I'm trying to parse that since under Facebook
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:41.340]   well they call it curated search because you know they involve human input to it
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:46.740]   but it's really social search because it's it's it's what among your who among
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:52.820]   your social circle that's gonna be scary for Google of Facebook's they didn't go
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:59.820]   incredibly say we own that and and you know for people to use and I was hearing
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.140]   some people say that people are already using Facebook for search but I don't
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.540]   know how you would do that well Facebook would have the ability to generate
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.780]   search results and rank them according to a links popularity within a person's
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.740]   group of Facebook friend now Google's already hidden that way where I'm I'm
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.780]   quite amazed when I look for random things and below one I see that you know
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.420]   Leo as as right right I think that's valuable
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:29.380]   yeah that's a big signal for sure yeah so this is based on likes this is based on
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:35.700]   what your friends have been liking with Facebook basically it's I mean it sounds
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.620]   that way I mean it sounds very much like what big does or delicious does it
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.860]   anybody any sort of you know social network where you can favor things but
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.380]   Facebook just has has the users and is in pushing likes for a really long time
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:50.580]   the patent is quote visual tags for search results generated from social
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:58.820]   network he said that so information thing yeah cuz I do that being see I
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.620]   wonder if you sign in to being using Facebook is it gonna get your track
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:11.180]   history that's gonna freak people out well it would be it's good for Bing I
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:15.140]   don't know I don't know anybody who's abandoned Google for Bing I know people
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:22.100]   who tried and and I've heard people complain I had said I was Tom Merritt is
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:27.260]   he still is he still doing it no he gave up long ago it says it's a rank based
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.860]   on frequency clicks by the members of your social network see this thing just
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:34.940]   because I click on a search result does not mean that I recommend it it just
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.620]   means that it looks like maybe it's the thing that I want right and by the way
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.580]   how big is your Facebook social network it's a hundred people 200 people it's
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.460]   not right it's not a huge sample you still get benefited a hundred but but
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.940]   then is that really my social network you know it's the combination it's my
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:54.380]   Twitter people are probably more valuable than my Facebook people oddly
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:59.660]   because we know we're interested in the same thing happy birthday to YouTube
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:05.660]   gosh I can't believe it's five years old I remember when Amber MacArthur in fact
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.980]   I think it's still on the web you can go look at her you it's on YouTube as a
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:14.860]   matter of fact her piece that she did on our TV show she said like this is new
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:21.700]   cool site people can upload videos so easily it's kind of it's kind of neat
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:29.940]   there's a video on YouTube that is the timeline this is pretty cool and then
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:34.740]   how they're hiring so Rick Klaus is over there but they're hiring new new
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.980]   people I remember thinking these guys are crazy they're never gonna be able to
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.060]   host and stream that much video oh yeah in fact we said they've got a big
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.140]   problem here because they're gonna get sued to death yeah yeah well and that's
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.780]   what I have with my own pernatal students were you know one of my students has a
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:54.020]   really good analogy idea and she was talking about business model and saying
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.420]   she charged well why are you in charge well because a friend of mine does it
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:00.420]   and he pays for the servers and I said if that's your goal in life stop yeah
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:04.780]   right you know look back at YouTube it went berserk I've got I've got employee
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:09.060]   number 20 from YouTube is in my class now oh really wow again honk who is
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:14.940]   this is a wonderful guy working on the new business and you know if you think
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.660]   like Silicon Valley you think no grow as big as possible and then magical
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:24.020]   something that will happen here's an interesting acquisition green parrot
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:29.780]   pictures it's a company that specializes in fixing video quality Google just I
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.460]   haven't seen it operate if you see it there is a an example on YouTube you
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:39.380]   want to you want to watch yeah all right let's see here and we talked on
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:44.220]   Twitter about how Google also bought the next new networks so here is yeah that
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:47.620]   that was was that oh do we talk about that last week that was Twitter I thought
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.740]   okay yeah it's a content company so that's kind of interesting well they're
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.020]   gonna get rid of the content keep the platform keep the platform and platforms
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:57.020]   where the money is so I didn't see anything happen so here's original footage
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:02.020]   kind of bouncy shaky cam iMovie does this too and does a pretty good job of it
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.500]   and now here nobody be cool if this is built into YouTube you just upload your
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:12.140]   video and it kind of cleans it up so shaky cam shaky cam shaky cam
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:18.740]   wow that's my motion sickness just what a way yeah that's a lot better I mean
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:23.620]   does I was very similar to what I movie does yeah on the new I movie on Apple
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:30.500]   and in fact when you import your footage on an I movie it automatically does it
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:35.180]   for you if you you know if you say okay that's a big difference and I can see
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:40.340]   that be a big selling point if you if does that automatically got crappy video
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:44.780]   uploaded to YouTube it will fix it that's nice yeah wow
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:49.220]   interesting take a break come back with more our tool and tip and number of the
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:54.260]   week in a couple of quick stories to where there's a lot Facebook did block

[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:31.340]   I said this on Twitter I was gonna eat crow and go ahead and buy the iPad - I went
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.420]   to the line and they were out of anything but the huge one so I didn't do it I

[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:38.140]   weeks squarespace.com/tweig we thank you for their support of this week in
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:43.260]   Google let's start with Gina Trapani her tip of the week I'm afraid I'm gonna
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:48.460]   take that your tool are you gonna talk about Google for iOS Leo yeah how'd you
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:52.940]   know okay so you know I won't do that one all right take my tool please I won't
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:56.780]   take your tool I've been trying to get her to take my tool for years that's so
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.820]   mean I'm sorry I said that how did you know that was my tool no no you should
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.980]   do that one because I actually don't have iOS to try it out on okay I have it
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:07.380]   in front of me so the main thing to try this week is a Google Docs comments which
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.620]   we already talked about a very tiny little tip though gmail just added click
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:16.140]   to call to the web browser so if you check your gmail and someone has emailed
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:20.500]   you their phone number or their phone number is in their signature you click
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:25.260]   on it and gmail fills it in it fills it into Google chat to make the call
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:29.700]   directly from from G chat and that calling is free right now they extended
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.940]   that so it's an easy way it's kind of the same interface that you have on your
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.380]   phone right just tap a number and you can call but now you can do it through
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.700]   your browser so I was at South by Southwest and someone had emailed me his
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.940]   phone number and I was like oh that's a link I had never seen that before and

[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:12.460]   go he loves think up by the way I know I know it's so great you know we had the
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:16.660]   founder of I fix it show up and I fix at the Mac yes we were kind of talking
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.620]   around the tables like how many thousands of dollars is I fix it
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:24.620]   collectively saved us all and so DIY that's really fun and they're they're
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:32.620]   tear downs of not just the iPad 2 but the iPad cover yes 22 magnets in here it's
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:37.540]   just crazy yeah he said that they broke the iPad 2 glass it was the first iPad
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:41.420]   glass that they broken because it's so much thinner well it's also the way they
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:45.300]   but yeah you can't they glued it all the way around it's not just tabs right yeah
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.100]   so yeah those guys buy those iPads and take them part and sell the parts but
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.420]   they take them part by hand it's crazy they're incredible I just they're really
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:57.980]   cool I think it's one of the best blogs out there so yeah good how neat expert
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:03.180]   labs is online where expert labs org is the place to find us and we got a blog
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.420]   there and the bounty announcement is there along with some other some other
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:13.060]   news so yeah check us out nito Jeff Jarvis your number of the week I'm gonna
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:18.700]   use this one and Netflix delivers 61% of legal video downloads on the internet
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:25.060]   which of course is probably only a 2% total video download right and and I
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:30.900]   mentioned that because I'm I'm there's a nice little confluence of network war
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.420]   stories right the fact that to Brian's fault with the New York Times reports
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:39.820]   that Netflix is looking to buy an original series which I just love because
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:44.980]   that puts Netflix in their top dishes with both networks and in a sense MSOs and
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:51.060]   it makes them a new distributor of content hallelujah just we need competition at
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:54.900]   the same time Facebook these are things in the in the log is going to air
[00:59:54.900 --> 01:00:00.740]   baseball so it too repeats with networks Wow at the same time the networks are
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:06.260]   having a hissy fit because time Warner cables app was streaming content and
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:11.300]   they're complaining I wouldn't want to be a network right now so you go look and
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.300]   see what the law would come cast by of Jeff well because they'll be no network
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:20.140]   neutrality and they'll find ways to advantage them and try to kill Netflix
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:24.580]   and that's where the war is going to be I got to see senator Al Franken at
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:29.860]   South West a very good presentation in which he gave the rousing defense of
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:38.780]   Netflix of well Netflix via neutrality and it's important folks and he was
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.860]   yelling at the crowd that yelling was being very funny but he's being great
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.580]   about that I have to say he's been so right on oh yes he really was a very
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.300]   good talk and he said you know entrepreneurs are job creators you have
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.620]   more clout than you realize you have power right and I think what what should
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:00.260]   come out of South West is action I think South West should organize a
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:05.380]   yes gee it's entrepreneurs lobbying trip Washington I've been saying that for
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:09.940]   some time it's very easy for geeks we're so you know into what we do and we have
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:15.300]   blinders on we forget that we have clout and we often aren't political and we
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.620]   got this is this is one issue where we really have to stand up and be counted
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.060]   because it's all relies on network neutrality and all of this stands on that
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.940]   House of Cards so watch this in the weeks and months to come you're gonna
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:31.460]   find the cable companies trying to find more ways to smash Netflix because they
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:36.380]   realize that that's a huge competitor and you ask the question why would Comcast
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:41.940]   why would cable town buy NBC because because as bad as the networks business
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.980]   is it's better than the cable companies business model right now so they're all
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:50.820]   screwed and I know if you have a choice I'd rather be a content creator than a
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:56.020]   content carrier I should have put this well right and when you look what
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:59.540]   YouTube is doing and YouTube is crying creating you know buying extra networks
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:04.300]   is a way to make better content there I think we finally find this somebody is
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.020]   gonna make a big a big internet and that's gonna change the whole dynamic
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:13.140]   one of these days it's you Leo somebody's gonna make it big on the internet it's
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.540]   you you're going to do the tattoo show and then you just don't know what's gonna
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:20.940]   happen it's gonna go wild on you think the tattoo is all this is a tattoo show
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:27.260]   yes Leo's tats I've got I'm a blank canvas baby that's right that's right
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:38.380]   me up all right Gina I know you wouldn't trust me I could promise you you would
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:43.660]   not watch that right after glee yeah right after glee I just like leave this
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:48.300]   week I didn't see it how did you like it I what do you think Leo did you watch
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:53.780]   Gina I did my my DVR screwed up and I so I I started halfway through it was
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.660]   very upsetting I'll screw it up because of because of my trip guys just buy it
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:00.820]   it's on iTunes just buy it yeah I'm just gonna I just end up buying it tell me
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.900]   if this was was was this was a next step but I thought it was and I thought it
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:09.780]   was important it was the it was a major gay teen kiss who and and and what's
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.580]   great about that was there's no you know the world did not collapse the next
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.980]   day except you know we have times have changed if you don't I'm reading a great
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.180]   David David bein koolies book about the Smothers Brothers where they got
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.380]   censored because they said the word breast my breasts swells with love for
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.780]   you they actually had to cut that out that's crazy I thought you're gonna say
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:35.780]   it was a turning point because they did original songs that's how that's how
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:39.860]   except it's become big deal a couple of guys kissing what's the hell is it like
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.540]   whatever that those two are falling in love for like two years already I'm glad
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:47.060]   they finally kiss I put it wrong I put it wrong wasn't the kiss it was the fact
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.100]   that you know in any show there's a sexual attention relationship that finally
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:55.100]   burs and now it's that one as a relationship blossoming and they did a
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:59.700]   very good job with it and they made fun I I said on Twitter it was good that
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.900]   they that happened they made fun of a church lady and I got you know certain
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:07.060]   people be only to be on Twitter probably mostly church ladies I would
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:17.700]   guess yeah yeah I missed it I have actually not the season we resumed without
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:22.540]   letting me know I've got a I've got a bunch of it yeah yeah caught up but I'm
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:27.740]   gonna buy my tunes right yeah that's what I did so I know I got it yeah because
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.620]   my DVR screwed up a number of times with it I think that they may be doing some
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:35.860]   DVR manipulation yeah maybe maybe I don't know there was definitely an
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.180]   argument in my house last night about why the season pass was not correctly
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:55.020]   configured that's it I'm taking the remote control I am now in charge that's
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:59.740]   really funny that's the modern the modern family fights over the Tivo yes
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:09.020]   it's like no V is lower priority than Glee V V V V oh boy you're such a geek
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:14.760]   just cuz it's sci-fi I don't know maybe I think I just lost my geek card V should
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.740]   be higher than than Glee I think V is over Glee it's a unless it's alphabetical
