[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, I'm Jason Howell,
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.300]   filling in for Leo. We've got to have Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis,

[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.840]   And we talk a lot about the coronavirus and the impact
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.880]   that it's having on the technology industry,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.840]   specifically Google I/O, is canceled,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.680]   and so many other facts, including,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.400]   don't touch your face. Just please don't do it.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.440]   It's really hard, but just don't do it.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.560]   Twitter is testing fleets, basically Twitter's stories,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.720]   implementation, also official recognition with Google Title,

[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.120]   if not a little bit longer, to not touch your face.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.480]   I'm Jason Howell, sitting in for Leo LaPorte,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.480]   who is somewhere else.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.760]   Where is he? He's on his way to-- St. Louis.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.800]   St. Louis, there we go. Thank you.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.920]   Hopefully not touching his face on the plane.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.480]   I'm sure he is.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.240]   Sitting in touch and everyone else's pro.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.040]   Yes, exactly. Sitting next to me, of course,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.160]   at Pruitt here in studio, how you doing at?
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.880]   I'm already failing to test, as you can see on camera.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.800]   Oh, boy. You just don't care.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.600]   Touching your face and you don't care.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.200]   I can't help it. I can't help it.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   You can't help it.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.280]   I mean, you can touch your face.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.440]   Just don't touch me after you touch your face.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.960]   Got it.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.480]   Note it.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.680]   And advice first, I'll do the same.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.080]   I'll really try to do the same.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.240]   Also joining us, the return of Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.440]   It's good to see you again.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.120]   Hello.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.280]   It's been too long.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.000]   I missed Joel last week.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.560]   Likewise.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.880]   Just you.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.920]   Well, I did too, but I wasn't here.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.240]   I'm usually not here except for weeks like this.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.360]   So it's good to see you again.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.520]   And also, Jeff Jarvis on the other side of me.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.960]   How you doing, Jeff?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.600]   Trying to scratch my beard with my elbow.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.920]   See, it doesn't work.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.440]   Nice try.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   Nice try.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.400]   These are--
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.760]   I'm going to scratch my nose and my lower third.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.240]   It's just the right height for you to scratch your nose.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.600]   These are impossible rules.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.720]   And I don't know how I could go all day without touching my face.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.200]   It's just one of those things that just like--
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   We could just ask--
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.640]   Aren't your eyes hitching right now, Jason?
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.120]   They are.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.960]   They're a little foggy right now.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.400]   I feel like they need to get in there, but I'm not going to.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.360]   Yes.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   Go ahead.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.520]   Oh, thank you.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.040]   Nice one.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.680]   It's better.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   It's better.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.040]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.680]   There were she ovens animated hand.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.120]   Yes.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.200]   Thanks, Jeff.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.240]   That's only for you--
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.720]   video viewers.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   So-- and then, of course, Carsten,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.720]   we've got you sitting over in the corner as well.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.480]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   Carsten corner.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.840]   The Carsten corner.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.640]   Carsten corner.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.040]   Carsten trolls the host.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.560]   Yes.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.080]   That's right.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.960]   That's my job.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440]   Pushes buttons when Kevin doesn't know it.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.800]   Why don't we start with the most joyful and joyous topic
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.280]   of all, and that is the coronavirus.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.040]   Ah, this topic, I'm done.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.400]   Like, I'm done with it.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.880]   And I know it feels like we're kind of--
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.360]   yeah, it feels that way.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.640]   Like, we're still very early, or maybe we aren't,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.800]   or maybe we're overreacting, or maybe we're underreacting.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.120]   We don't have data to know.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.920]   There's no data.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   It's not testing.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.600]   So we don't know.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.800]   Really frustrating.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.320]   I saw this tweet from a woman in Seattle yesterday.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.040]   And I think it kind of had its little viral tear through Twitter.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.920]   So to speak.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.720]   Yeah, no pun intended.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.440]   And it was basically just her saying, look, I felt sick.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.960]   I've got a history of respiratory illness.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.800]   I felt like all the boxes were checked.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.720]   And so I got on the phone to see what I need to do.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.480]   If I feel like I could possibly be part of this whole coronavirus
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.040]   thing.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.560]   And I don't want to infect anyone else.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.720]   Like, I'm going to do the right thing.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.400]   She basically was tossed from phone call to office,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.600]   to phone call to phone call.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.560]   Totally spun around in a million different circles.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.640]   And in the end, they basically said, well, you're not
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.280]   suffering enough for us to treat you.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.760]   So essentially, the word was, come back to us
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.360]   when you're dying.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.320]   Well, to test you.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.000]   Not to treat you just to test you.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.920]   Right, just to test you.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   Exactly.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.240]   I mean, unless you're dying, there's no treatment.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.120]   Because we just don't have one.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.040]   But yes, the UK--
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.920]   Well, no, I saw two doctors arguing.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.320]   Because there's a doctor, Jeff Jarvis, who's an actual doctor.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.800]   Oh, really?
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.640]   And he was discussing with another doctor
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.800]   that they're going to have to triage things like intubation.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.320]   Is it not going to have enough?
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.120]   Right.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120]   And they're going to decide.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.480]   So there are no there is things they will do.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.920]   Well, yes, but you have to be closer to death.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.840]   Like, if you feel feverish, until you
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.160]   have trouble breathing or your fever spikes.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.280]   Right, true.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.760]   But you want to know whether you're carrying it
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.000]   so you can be responsible to others.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.400]   Stacey, I've got a few questions for you.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.760]   Can I start off here?
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.680]   Because I got two geographic questions for you.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.800]   So I want you to put on your Austin cowboy hat for a second.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.640]   I was going to say, is this about South By?
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.600]   Yeah, it is.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.760]   Because I've been fascinated.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.840]   I've been reading the South By tweets all weekend.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.640]   And as you know, there's now a change to auto-work petition
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.680]   to cancel South By.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.600]   That's up to almost 50,000 signatures last I checked.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.240]   And the tweets are a mix of, hey, I'll be at booth 47.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.080]   Come on by with cancel this thing.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.400]   And my sense is that the locals who you might have thought
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.280]   would say, no, we want the business.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.520]   The locals are soon to be adamant saying, no, 200,000 people
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.280]   come with new germs.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.000]   No, get the written on them.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.280]   And the mayor and the organizers are saying, no.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.000]   So I'm curious, what are you hearing
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.960]   from your old Austin friends?
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.320]   So this petition has actually been around for a couple of days.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.640]   And I got it from a local friend who-- yes,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.280]   but who is also freaked to be unbelief
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.920]   and stupidly freaked about what's happening.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.640]   So I feel like the initial signers' signatories
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.960]   were panicked people.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.040]   The other thing to think about is South By Southwest
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.320]   is like a $350 million impact on Austin.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.280]   And Austin has a huge tech community.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.200]   And for them, it's a chance to show off a lot,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.000]   like how legit we are.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.080]   It's a chance to network and have everyone come to your town.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.400]   So for the most part, people were fine
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   until the tech firm started pulling out.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.640]   And then it started looking irresponsible.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.600]   So Austin, for the most part, yeah, there's a couple freaked
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.320]   out because Austin also has this weird, hippie,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.120]   dippy, wellness, anti-vaxx community too.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.800]   So those people are like, ah, science scary.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.200]   Well, partly because they haven't vaccinated their children
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.600]   even against the flu.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.120]   Don't get me started on how contradictory that is.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.720]   So I do think South By Southwest will probably end up
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.800]   becoming untenable and thus become canceled.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.120]   And the organizers will try to make it seem like they were
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.960]   doing the best thing.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.320]   We still have-- and what-- we still have a lot of time.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.440]   And they just actually announced these guys.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.000]   Yeah, they just announced new--
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.160]   Chris Evans and Camille--
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.080]   Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.920]   All right, so now go to Seattle, where you seem
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.600]   to be in the ground zero of COVID here in the US thus far.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.040]   We can't wait to know because we're not testing.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.960]   So we're going to find other things.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.760]   But right now--
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   There was two confirmed deaths.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.400]   This is there?
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.280]   --the tragic deaths have occurred.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.320]   So what's the move like there?
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.720]   Was there two deaths?
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.200]   They're nine now.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.880]   There are nine confirmed deaths.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   But so the thing is, OK.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.040]   So yes, the first people, I think, did come off from--
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.680]   the case-- one of the first cases in the US was in Seattle.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.120]   The challenges, the next cases, were
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.920]   in a senior living facility.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.760]   And those people are dying quickly because they're very sick.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.800]   So that's one thing to think about.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.120]   The scarier stuff is that that person who originally
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.040]   came back and was ill many, many weeks ago, apparently,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.600]   it's been circulating in our community for a while.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   Yay!
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.400]   But you're on an island.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.080]   I'm on an island.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.960]   So it's not really--
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.840]   I mean, it is really an island, but everyone who lives on the island
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.800]   goes back and forth.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.240]   So it's not like a true island.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240]   Anyway.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.440]   So I am in this weird space where if--
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.200]   and there was a stat article based on this guy in the Fred Hutchinson
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.160]   Institute here who talked about, we really
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.000]   need to act now from a public health perspective
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.480]   to quarantine Seattle because he believes it's going to be like Wuhan
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.080]   several weeks ago.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.320]   And if you quarantine it, we still
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.400]   have a chance of stopping this thing.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.080]   That's this one guy.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.520]   And it's really uncertain.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.920]   It feels like if we really could stop it,
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.160]   we probably should quarantine.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.280]   And that would be freaky as all belief.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.760]   But if we've just decided that it's going to run its course,
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.000]   we probably should just say that and be like, yeah, we're not going to--
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.120]   because it feels like right now we're still like, will we?
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.640]   Won't we?
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.200]   Will we?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.680]   Will we?
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.600]   We'll see what happens.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.000]   What would quarantine in the city mean?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.600]   That's my question.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.640]   What is the quarantine?
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.160]   Like I have a sense of what a quarantine is.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.640]   What is the OK?
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.440]   Diembrella.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.440]   So it could be a big global bolverine.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.360]   If the public-- so most of the companies in Seattle
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.200]   have said they will follow whatever King County, which
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   is the county-- King County Public Health.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.560]   King County is working with Squatose.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.200]   I can never say it.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.880]   Snowmish.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.200]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.360]   Snowmish?
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.600]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.520]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.240]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.880]   I-- home-ish.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.640]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   Interesting.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.480]   Big friends with a little bit at my house.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.320]   I haven't lived here long enough to get all that.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.840]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.240]   But yeah.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.880]   And I live next to sequalomy, but that's different.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.000]   Anyway, the point is those guys will work together.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.840]   There is no quam-e.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.320]   No, no.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.520]   There's no snow in my sequal--
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   Yeah, it's no quam--
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.680]   it's--
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.040]   It's--
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.240]   Sequal-mish is different.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   Oh, sequal-mish.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.320]   OK, that is different.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.080]   That's where--
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   Sequal-mish.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   Look, I challenge you to be there.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.240]   I'll never be able to make this show title today.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.200]   OK, so anyway, yeah, that's the pass.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   Snow-homish.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.400]   I was there two weeks ago.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.760]   It was lovely.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.440]   OK, I don't know where I was now.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   Oh, so they'll say--
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.440]   So they'll say--
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.560]   You were in the cars in Vortex.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.000]   That's where you were.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.240]   They'll say quarantine.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.200]   And what will happen then is all the businesses
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.840]   to be great to follow that will voluntarily quarantine
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.200]   themselves and shut down.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.400]   The schools will shut down when the county says to.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.440]   So then you've got work from home, school shutting down.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.000]   If you want to make it a super crazy type quarantine,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   I think you have to get the federal government and the CDC
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.960]   to declare it.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   And then at that point, they can shut down airports.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.320]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.480]   Shut down, inner state.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.320]   Inner state highways.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.480]   I was like, intercontinental highways.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.320]   So that's how that works.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.200]   And then-- but like a true quarantine,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.080]   because people are, in some cases, stocking up on food
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.520]   because they want to make sure they have a couple of weeks
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   of food.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.600]   They're taking all the masks and all this kind of stuff.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.400]   In a true, like, oh no, the CDC is involved type quarantine.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.680]   Within the city, people are able to do whatever--
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   I think there's like a move on.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.000]   Because like it will be with every day.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.920]   Run around.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.680]   Yes, you just can't leave the area.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.880]   You just can't leave the area.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.400]   OK.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.080]   All right.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.760]   There's a neat story about this.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.280]   Hold on, let me put it in here.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.200]   In the rundown chat, Washington Post
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.880]   had a story yesterday, but during the bubonic plague
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.520]   in the 17th century, a village knew
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.280]   that they were badly infected.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.920]   And so they quarantined themselves.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.080]   It was a really, really soulful thing to do, 1665.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   And people would come and leave food on rocks
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.240]   outside of town for the villagers, grateful to them
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.760]   that they were not leaving town.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.560]   The villagers left coins that were doused in vinegar,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.480]   thinking that would clean the coins.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.280]   Vinegar does have clean coins.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.520]   Or clean off bacteria.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.040]   So in fact, it made a difference.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.000]   14 months went by and nobody went in or out of the village.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.040]   For 14 months.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.520]   There's a house in the village, the picture here,
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.760]   called Plague Cottage.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.040]   I can't imagine its real estate value is very good.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.760]   But it's phenomenal so that they--
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.320]   one family, one woman buried her children and her husband,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.520]   called Gatha, the place of skulls.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.240]   260 of the 800 residents perished during the quarantine.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.520]   More than double the mortality rate of the Great Plague
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.600]   in London.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.960]   But because of their self-sacrifice,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.120]   the nearby towns did not have it.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.240]   That for 14 months, it was lifted.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.520]   Wow.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.120]   So--
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.440]   Wow.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.160]   Sacrifice.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.720]   No kidding.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.760]   I am prepared to self-quarantine after I do my speech.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.920]   You work at home already.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.440]   So I'm--
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.340]   I am totally going to plague Gatha G
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.900]   and wait, that is the Carson thing to do.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.420]   It would be.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.900]   We had a rundown yesterday at school on Hangouts.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.580]   So we could run our classes that way and make sure.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.580]   And Google has upped all EDU accounts
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.820]   and many corporate accounts too.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.660]   So that was that we have 100 people per Hangout.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.160]   OK.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.580]   Now it's $250 per Hangout.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.660]   And we couldn't record the Hangout before.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.540]   Now they added that into our thing.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.220]   So until the end of July, I think it is.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.500]   A lot of Hangout accounts are quite
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.020]   upgraded to be able to handle this.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   Yeah, then.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.580]   My daughter's school is using Zoom.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.220]   And she is already freaking out because--
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.700]   not because of the coronavirus.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.340]   Most of the kids in her class are just like, la, la.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.300]   That's fine.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.820]   It will kill all the old people.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.540]   With the true callousness of youth.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.180]   I'm like, yeah, I was like that once.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.380]   But they're using Zoom.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.460]   But she's freaked out because he's like, OK,
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.940]   we need to synchronize our watches.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.140]   And at 10.05 exactly, I'm taking attendance.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.420]   So you should be on the Zoom call.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.580]   Technical difficulties are not an excuse.
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.340]   And my child being very anxious about stuff
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.220]   and very conscientious is already like, OK,
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.500]   we'll have to test it beforehand.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.060]   Oh, what if our internet's down?
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:20.860]   I'm like, OK.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.820]   We'll log in half an hour early.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.300]   We'll--
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.060]   Calm the heck down.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.220]   We're going to be fine.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.100]   But mom, good on her, though.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.020]   Good on her, though.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.420]   Absolutely.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.220]   So thank you, Stacey, for that.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.780]   You were-- I was going to say two vortices,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.340]   but you also have a Carsten Vortex 2 of this.
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.500]   And I was thinking about you all week with that.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.060]   But then we have Google and Facebook
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.060]   and the South by Southwest and everybody else in the world.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.060]   There's there so much coronavirus news in the rundown.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.220]   It's a big deal.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.940]   I have to tell people, first off,
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.900]   that there is actually no toilet paper.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.500]   I know people are like, the media is exaggerated.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.580]   I don't know why there's no toilet paper.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.980]   But there is truly no toilet paper.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.980]   Because people are hoarding it.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.500]   That's a real thing that's happening in all the grocery
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.380]   stores.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.420]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.780]   I certainly know hand sanitizer.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.100]   Bottles of alcohol are running out.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.140]   I can buy spray Lysol.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.940]   If you order--
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.740]   what you need to do is order--
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.740]   you can still get isopropyl alcohol and--
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.460]   Aloe vera.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.060]   And essential oils.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.500]   No, actually, if you mix the aloe vera with alcohol,
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.540]   then that's the same thing as purel.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.140]   What's the--
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.540]   If you wanted to smell nice, you stick an essential oil in it.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.740]   You know, what's nice is mint.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.140]   Because then you can clear your sinuses as you're doing it.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.260]   You shouldn't be spilling your hands in any case.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.540]   Oh my gosh, you guys, calm down.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.660]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.660]   No, no, no, no, you're doing it.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.660]   Oh no.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.660]   It's over.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.660]   It's over.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.580]   Touch your face.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.660]   Don't touch your camera.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.420]   Spread it over here.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.300]   Don't do it.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.780]   Not that we're overreacting or anything.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.860]   And I'm working on--
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.180]   Kevin, if you want to take my--
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.860]   Yeah, I'm working on a Kickstarter for this mask right here.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.220]   I'm going to be selling these masks on Kickstarter soon.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.940]   They're totally not good.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.540]   They're not N95 or anything.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.060]   But--
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.900]   But they look cool.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.380]   They look cool.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.860]   They look like they do something.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.340]   This is-- that's like a window into our Mad Max future
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.300]   that is right around the corner after all the dust settles here.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.980]   So now in the Bay Area, guys, what's the reaction to no I/O, no F8?
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.460]   Well, yeah, so we haven't even talked about that, right?
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.460]   I guess last week--
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.940]   I assumed last week the F8 news had broke in time for the show.
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.700]   But I guess it hadn't.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.900]   No.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.540]   We heard Facebook was canceling F8.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.980]   It's developer conference.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.780]   The second I read that news, I was like,
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.100]   "Oh, Google I/O's going away.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.140]   It's not going to happen."
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.460]   Google I/O would first straight out said, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.460]   We're talking about everything.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.420]   It's still going ahead.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.140]   They all do.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.220]   They all say that while they're still calculating.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.900]   And then like a day later, they're like, oh, actually, yeah,
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.220]   we're going to cancel too.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.820]   I'll never understand that.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.700]   Just say no comment.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.860]   Yeah, I suppose so.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.700]   Say no comment.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.180]   Because you don't know.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.140]   No, you don't know.
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.580]   That'll get your worst press.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.500]   That'll get your worst press.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.740]   What's that, Carson?
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.340]   You've got to say you're doing it until you're not doing it.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.820]   Because you are still doing it.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.180]   At that moment, you're still doing it.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.340]   You haven't made the decision to not do it.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.300]   We're being very careful.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.820]   We're going to follow the guidelines.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.380]   But we are monitoring the situation closely.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.060]   There's always that thing in there, which is basically
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.900]   they're out.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.300]   A lot of places are giving refunds too.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.700]   And I think this is an interesting option or way
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.780]   to do this a little--
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.420]   offer the refunds to people if they want to cancel their tickets.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.660]   And then when you see that 60% of your people have canceled,
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.180]   you're like, OK.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.700]   No, it's canceled.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.940]   Never mind.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.460]   So Google said the people who got into 2020
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.620]   will be able to buy tickets for 2021.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.820]   No lottery for them.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.180]   So that's a little bit of a bonus, a little bit of silver lining.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.740]   If people were selected for the lottery for 2020,
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.660]   they won't have to do that.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.780]   They'll automatically get the offer to purchase the ticket.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.820]   Next year, it's not like they get a free ticket or anything.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.100]   But they have the opportunity without entering
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.140]   any sort of lottery.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.540]   In the rundown, there's a box story about the economic impact.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.340]   And it said that the total impact so far was--
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.260]   that $480 million was the impact of mobile rural congress
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:37.740]   alone.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.820]   Yeah, alone.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.580]   $20 million--
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.020]   For I/O.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.020]   --Google I/O.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.540]   Wow.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.020]   I mean, it's like $400 million to do.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.740]   It's $400 million to do it.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.460]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.300]   Well, and yes, it says if South By cancels, which--
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.300]   I mean, let's be real.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.020]   It's going to cancel, right?
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.860]   I don't know.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.700]   I forget what you're doing.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.100]   I don't know.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.380]   I guess we should.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.860]   Losses would be total around $900 million.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.980]   So I mean, this is no small deal.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.180]   I mean, I feel like every day a new event is canceling.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.300]   It's important to think about how quickly things are changing.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.300]   So last weekend, nobody had died in Seattle, right?
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.700]   And then all of a sudden, we're on the crux
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.020]   of their canceling comic-con here.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.300]   And two nights ago, I was like, well, we'd still go if it was
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:24.820]   happening.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.620]   But now all the guests have pulled out.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.180]   So we're like, oh, well, no, no, I don't want to go.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.500]   So I feel like it's just changing so fast.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.060]   So by the 13th, maybe it's wise for South By
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.820]   it'd be like, maybe cases will stop increasing.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.020]   I know that's not likely, but maybe cases will stop increasing.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.420]   And then--
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.300]   If we were testing, I'd feel better about that.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.300]   But we have no idea of the extent of this yet.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.740]   We're just starting testing.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.300]   No, I know.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.260]   Being in a place where--
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.700]   Israel has told 60,000 people to quarantine.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.500]   That's a lot of people.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.000]   Wow.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.980]   That's a lot of people.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.380]   We've tested like 50, something like that.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.460]   Little Cali, but some small number.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.740]   We talked a little bit about it on all about Android last night
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.940]   with the impact that Mobile World Congress and all
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.980]   of the hotels losing money and so on and so forth.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.340]   But I didn't even think about the locals and what--
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:18.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.820]   She was talking about it all.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.180]   Oh, I feel bad for like--
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.500]   Didn't even think about those folks,
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.700]   how it's going to impact them having all those people
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.500]   swarming into the area and how do they feel about that.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.980]   Potentially bringing germs.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.620]   And I didn't even think about that.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.820]   That's so fun.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.780]   That's what-- and you're right.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:40.540]   I presume when I started looking at the SXXW tweets,
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.740]   I thought that'd be the case.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.700]   No, no, no, it'll be OK.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.300]   I want to sell my tacos.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.700]   Uh-huh.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.540]   People have to come up.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.300]   Well, you have to remember--
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:47.820]   --our families.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.700]   --on Twitter.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.700]   These are--
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.580]   True, that's true.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.060]   --the people.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.700]   I mean, I guarantee you the hotel workers who
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.780]   are suddenly looking at not getting tips and not getting--
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.740]   Those people are like--
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.140]   Or not getting trolls worse on the poorest.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.140]   Right.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.020]   --who are very little who don't have--
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.940]   --our time, hourly.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.620]   --six days off--
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.020]   --who don't have health insurance.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.460]   So true.
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:08.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.460]   Indeed.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.620]   So the dumbest thing I've seen--
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.900]   but this is so classic out of geeks.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.620]   It's on the rundown.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.820]   A bunch of-- a bunch of geeks in Austin
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.580]   plan to hold a hack coronavirus meeting.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.260]   And maybe they'll come up with a new hand
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.500]   to the bottom of the story.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.660]   They'll come up with an alternative for the handshake.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.540]   Oh, we need that hack, I thought.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.620]   We need some post-it notes for you.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.620]   Figure that out.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.980]   And then they'll post notes saying, don't handshake.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.740]   Do this.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.860]   Thanks, guys.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.780]   You got together to hack the coronavirus.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.460]   So you got into a room where you hack all over each other.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.620]   And you all get the coronavirus.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.940]   And you're all hacks.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.460]   She's-- I take back everything nice
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.700]   I've ever said about tech people.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.460]   That's just dumb.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.340]   Look, we have a replacement for the handshake.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.820]   Isn't it the elbow tap?
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.740]   Isn't that what they're saying?
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.700]   I mean, it says that right there in the article,
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.900]   we already began pitching and then
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.340]   eliminate the handshake and replace it
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.020]   with something like a fist bump or an elbow or a foot tap.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:09.780]   Just to stay--
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.140]   I don't really understand how fist bumps are no more
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.940]   sanitary than anything.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.580]   No, they're not good.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.100]   You're not good.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.100]   The fist bumps are dumb.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.620]   You're right.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.300]   I think a bump's still going to be good.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.060]   A Japanese bow.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.260]   That must be hard.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.540]   You can't do the Wakanda because that
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.900]   would be cultural appropriation.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.900]   But I'm thinking like a half Wakanda.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.420]   A half?
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.740]   Just a hit, a head nod.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.980]   Why don't you just do the--
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.740]   Just a hit, nod.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:31.940]   That's what I did.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.140]   No, not a nod like that.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.660]   It's the chin lift nod.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.660]   I can't do anything.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.900]   It's the sup nod.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.100]   No, that's a snotty.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.540]   Do that again.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.500]   That's a snotty.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.180]   No, no.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.020]   No, it's not.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.700]   Do that again.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.500]   That's a--
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.060]   That's a--
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.060]   That's a snotty.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.580]   That is seen as snotty.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.300]   Oh, OK.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:47.820]   OK.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.820]   Well, I'm clearly called.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.980]   Because when you do that, you look at someone's nose.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.180]   Look, he down to your nose at someone.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.380]   No, actually, he's in the middle.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.900]   That's both ways.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.620]   Today I learned.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.060]   Some cultures, it's a sup.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.060]   And some cultures, it's snotty.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.540]   OK.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.220]   All right, today I learned how to learn something new today.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.780]   Or you could just be in Texas.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.140]   People, when they drive down the street, you're just like,
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.620]   sup, sup.
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.620]   Yep.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.620]   You could do the queen thing.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.220]   It's just like the friendly--
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.900]   I do two to three fingers.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.540]   But you could do the--
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.580]   That's bad in the UK.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.180]   Fingers, fingers.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.420]   That's bad in the UK.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.620]   It's like this.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.620]   It's like--
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.780]   Well, you could--
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.460]   I'm surprised you haven't suggested that everyone
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.380]   in the world should do a hook on the horse.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.380]   Oh, come on.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.420]   I like it.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:32.900]   Oh, man.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.620]   Now I can get behind that.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.220]   She likes that.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.540]   So you know, maybe do a couple of head bangs.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.420]   Texas, no.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.460]   Be in geeks.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.460]   I can't do this manually.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.420]   Be in geeks, of course.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.900]   We have longer breaths.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.020]   So my fingers don't always do that.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.500]   It's hard.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.420]   I have to do it manually.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.940]   I have to force them apart.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.180]   This one doesn't do it.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.940]   It just went very far apart.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.460]   I see.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.620]   That's like your triple jointed.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.140]   Wow.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.140]   I can't get enough far apart.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.580]   Karsten, Karsten, let's see you do it.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.060]   You can't.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.380]   Oh, no, no.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.900]   No.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.860]   I don't think so.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.860]   No, no.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.860]   Really?
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.700]   No.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.220]   No.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.980]   Found the one thing Karsten did.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.660]   Hey.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.300]   Ant?
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.020]   How are you at it?
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.060]   I'm good.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.060]   Good.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.780]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.260]   OK.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.380]   All right.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.940]   We are so far down the rabbit hole.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.980]   We're only in the first story.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.460]   But there's lots of good stuff.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:28.980]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.020]   And look through here.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.180]   I didn't see this link before.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.180]   Don't lick ballot envelopes.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.900]   Probably just on the lobes.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.260]   Probably just envelopes in general.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.100]   Right.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.980]   Yeah, don't be licking envelopes anymore.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.860]   And I thought that was--
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.300]   Use an envelope.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.060]   For ballots in Washington State.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.820]   Mine sell sealed.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.380]   Well, yeah, did mine sell?
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.340]   Mine, mine, you just ripped off the little--
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:50.940]   I don't like that.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.380]   I don't like that.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.780]   And I thought it was to protect the voter,
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.820]   but actually it's to protect the person who opens the paper
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.340]   working.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.020]   Right.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.300]   Although 3M makes that adhesive stuff,
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.060]   and they make masks and, boy, 3M doing well in the coronavirus.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.660]   Let me just tell you.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.820]   The rabbis in Israel, like a chief rabbi,
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.820]   said that Jews and Israel should stop touching
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.940]   mazoos at the door, seriously.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.340]   Oh.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.660]   You know, but you're OK now.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.660]   Don't do it now.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.180]   Right.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.660]   Wow.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.300]   We have video of the California Health
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.940]   Official.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.860]   It's up down there now.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.260]   While telling people not to touch their face,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.460]   lick your finger.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460]   Don't show the video.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.060]   We'll get taken.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.060]   Don't show it.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:43.660]   Don't show it.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.700]   OK, it was Twitter.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.860]   It wasn't the YouTube--
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.780]   It's in the show links.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.860]   OK, so the show links.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.860]   Yes.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.860]   Oh, so I'll tell you.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.860]   Because it's hard not to do that stuff.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.220]   How are your eyes doing, Jason?
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.100]   They're really blurry right now, but I'm not touching them.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:27:59.740]   How's your nose?
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.740]   Is your nose a little itchy?
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.580]   It's just OK.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.420]   It's calm down.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.140]   Don't go there.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.060]   Sometimes my allergies, that's all it takes,
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.420]   is like they know that you're talking about building.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.220]   They feel that little tickler, Jason.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.740]   Yes.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.220]   That's all we're doing.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.900]   Oh.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.020]   So on your cheek.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.940]   Stop.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.540]   Stop.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.140]   This episode is hilarious.
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.380]   Other things that are happening, coronavirus related.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.900]   Outside of these events, canceling
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.140]   left, right, and center is just the sheer fact
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.740]   that all these companies are putting limits on travel now.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.540]   Or air-less.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.660]   So working from home, insisting that employees work from home.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.820]   I mean, it's just--
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.460]   That's good, though.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.420]   --going into another.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.300]   Twitter's strongly in the environment.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.860]   Employees globally to work at home.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.980]   Apple has restricted employee travel to China, Italy, South
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.940]   Korea.
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.500]   Salesforce, prohibiting international travel,
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.220]   and restricted all but the most critical domestic travel.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.340]   I mean, coming after company, putting these changes in place
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.900]   makes you wonder, I mean, similar to the events closing
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.540]   and people wondering after the fact, well,
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.860]   are the events necessary?
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.100]   Maybe.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.820]   I mean, do you think that these experiences might
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.100]   result in longer term change as far as how businesses run,
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.220]   what things are essential?
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.100]   No.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.980]   No.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.980]   I'm a hard no.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.480]   Wow.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.100]   It's going to all revert back to the way it was.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.820]   Display.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.940]   The reason I say that-- so there may be the occasional--
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.500]   and we may see lagging conferences die, like South
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.180]   by Southwest, wouldn't that be cool?
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.020]   But what I think what's going to happen
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.660]   is we'll go back to normal because there
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.980]   is a huge amount of value in FaceTime with people.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.820]   And a lot of these--
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.980]   that's what that's about.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.980]   I mean, and I mean, I don't know how often
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.740]   y'all have sat through webinars, but they are excruciating.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.100]   And no one should have to do that.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.620]   Yeah, I know.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.140]   I don't enjoy them nearly as much as going to an event.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.460]   We're social creatures.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.140]   And there's a lot of value in--
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.940]   and there's a lot of value that isn't conveyed well
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.020]   over video.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:07.300]   I mean--
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.380]   I'm not going to say I'm a social creature,
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.980]   but you do get a different vibe being right there
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.180]   in the same room.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.340]   You know, just a different energy that you can feel.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.540]   Yeah, I think the remote office is about as likely
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.540]   as the paperless office.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.900]   That's not going to happen.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.660]   But I feel-- I just feel terrible for the travel industry.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.740]   Louftonza has already decided to ground,
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.660]   well, the 20% of its fleet of the airlines
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.420]   are cutting flights after flight, circuit flights.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.460]   I forget what Caroline I think United offered any of its employees
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.300]   to go on unpaid leave.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.940]   Thank you very much.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.860]   It's going to be bad out there for some time.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.860]   I've got conferences coming up in June and July.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.660]   You think I'll be going?
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.060]   I don't know.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.420]   I have one in May.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.180]   And Bill was canceled.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:02.380]   Right.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.460]   Was Bill canceled?
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.820]   Bill does not yet--
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:04.820]   Bill--
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:05.340]   Bill--
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.540]   is as of me checking an hour ago.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.060]   OK.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.060]   Sorry.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.380]   Where is Bill?
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.460]   But I mean, I always may.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.580]   I always may.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.380]   So May is in too far out when you consider where we're at.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.460]   Although-- so I'll give you this.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.060]   I'm talking at an event tomorrow in Seattle.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.540]   And it is the--
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.460]   You're checking every hour, aren't you?
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.540]   I am checking every hour.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   But this morning, they had four of their people are now
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.460]   video giving their talks via video.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.060]   And then two canceled.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.340]   I'm still planning to go and do it in person,
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.420]   because video is, again, just--
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.460]   it's--
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.900]   It's just like a podcast.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.660]   Who wants that?
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:55.660]   Tomorrow, Leo will be live in St. Louis.
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.900]   That's right.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.860]   I've got it on my screen.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.540]   He'll be live in St. Louis at WWT.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.340]   And now they're letting any non-disease-ridden
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.340]   Twitter fans come watch it, because a bunch of people
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.420]   don't want to come watch it, because they're afraid to look
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.140]   at the sick.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.460]   However, Leo is letting people know--
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.420]   Leo is-- yes.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:18.940]   Just don't--
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.340]   That.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:26.420]   And you can also meet Leo tonight at the train wreck saloon.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.980]   Just please don't touch him.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.060]   Please don't touch him.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.780]   Right.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.780]   Please and thank you.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.700]   He says he will not shake your hand.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.980]   But he will wave at you from a respectful--
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.580]   What about selfies?
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.140]   How do you think-- what's your etiquette now
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.180]   for taking pictures with people who want to take pictures?
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:40.980]   That's pretty close.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.340]   Your cheek for cheek.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.660]   The hover hand is good.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.020]   What's the hover hand?
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.420]   When you do the thing where you don't actually--
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.420]   It's like this.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:49.780]   --there's a little--
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.140]   I was like, I need to aunt in--
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:51.940]   It's like this.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.500]   --just to demonstrate.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.500]   Oh, OK.
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.820]   See, he doesn't look like a great picture.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.780]   OK, that's actually what I do anyway,
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.180]   because when people want to--
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.140]   I don't feel--
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.820]   these people, they're like, can we take pictures?
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.140]   And I'm like, sure?
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.020]   I don't think so.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.460]   Then I'm like--
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.900]   Howard Stern's rule.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.380]   Howard Stern says he feels like just the worst ass anyway,
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.980]   because he's homophobic, so he doesn't want to shake
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.460]   anybody's hand ever.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.260]   And he doesn't want selfies, because he doesn't want--
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.300]   he thinks he's-- he doesn't want
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.780]   any pictures of himself on people's phones going around.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.460]   So now we can't do anything with people.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.780]   That's actually kind of arrogant.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.420]   I don't think I take photos well.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.820]   But if someone wants a picture with me,
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.740]   I'm like, well, who am I to stop it?
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.340]   He's neurotic.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.380]   Thank you, kids.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.380]   Yes.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.500]   So I just saw this tweet from Michael Pete Gibson.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.300]   In 1665, Cambridge University closed because of the plague.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.580]   Isaac Newton quarantined himself at his childhood home.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.180]   It was the most productive time of his life.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.740]   He discovered the calculus and laws of motion,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.220]   stuck a botkin in his eye to study optics.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.500]   How will you spend the next year?
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.700]   Well played.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.620]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.660]   What problem would he solve?
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.660]   Which not look as wide, probably stick a botkin in my eye.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.900]   All right, let's ponder that.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.900]   Let's think about all the things that we can solve in our time
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.740]   and our year-long staycation that is surely right
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.780]   around the corner as a result of the coronavirus.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.900]   Let's take a break and thank the sponsor.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.020]   And then we'll come back and we'll
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.060]   reveal what we are going to do with ourselves.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.020]   Or we'll talk about other news stories, whichever one
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.260]   you guys want to do.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.260]   Both.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:25.760]   Both.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.680]   We're going to do a 24-hour podcast.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.160]   We're just going to stay on the air all the time.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.340]   Because we have nothing else to do.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.620]   We have nowhere to go.
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.920]   We're just going to be here.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.260]   I mean--
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:34.920]   No.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.760]   No.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.260]   Hey.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:36.760]   Hey.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.260]   Hey.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.260]   Hey.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.720]   It's naughty again.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.760]   I mean, the beauty is we podcast.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.260]   It's true.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.640]   So that's pretty easy to do from home.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.080]   A lot of people actually do that from home.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.440]   It's some people on this very show.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.960]   So it's not out of the realm of possibility.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.200]   This episode of This Week in Google
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.000]   is brought to you by LinkedIn marketing solutions.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.820]   Time and place is everything, especially when
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.880]   you're talking about marketing.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.080]   But in today's age of a million messages per minute
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.880]   and not enough hours in the day, how can you really
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.160]   catch people's attention?
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.040]   It's really not as easy as you might expect.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.120]   It's definitely a lot more difficult.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.640]   When you think about it, there's so many moving pieces,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.680]   so many people out there.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.840]   So fortunately, there is a simple way.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.600]   LinkedIn can help you speak to the right professionals
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.840]   at the right time.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   With over 62 million decision makers on LinkedIn,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   you're able to connect with the right business leaders who
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.080]   are relevant to your company.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.440]   I would LinkedIn ads.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.920]   You can make sure your messages are
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.920]   getting through to these relevant people.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.280]   Rod Strouther, the director of digital and social center
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.480]   of excellence with Lenovo, said, with LinkedIn,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.360]   we're seeing a lift of 17% and brand favorability.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.800]   We're already looking at how we can extend this
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.640]   into other markets.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.440]   Lenovo was actually able to tailor its content
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.880]   to enhance the engagement with its audience.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.920]   Even small and medium sized businesses
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.120]   are making the most out of LinkedIn ads.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.040]   They're using LinkedIn to get their voices heard
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.280]   and their messages to resonate with the audience.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.880]   And of course, awareness is important, yes,
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.240]   but it's not just about awareness either.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.440]   LinkedIn ads are driving traffic and engagement.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.800]   That's visits to a landing page.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.960]   Registration to an event are downloads of thought leadership
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.800]   content with precise targeting small and medium sized
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.320]   businesses can speak to the people that matter.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.720]   We see all sorts of creativity coming from the people who
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.680]   are putting ads through LinkedIn.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.440]   At the end of the day, LinkedIn ads
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.080]   are helping small businesses and smaller businesses
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.040]   get big time results.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.640]   Try it for yourself.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.040]   You can check it out for yourself.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.520]   Go to LinkedIn where they're offering a free $100 LinkedIn
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.200]   ad credit to launch your first campaign.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.920]   Simply visit linkedin.com/twig.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.920]   That's linkedin.com/twig.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.920]   And check it out for yourself.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.760]   See what you think.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.440]   Terms and conditions apply.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.360]   And we thank LinkedIn for their support of this week in Google.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.600]   We've got to have other things in here
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.360]   that have nothing to do with the coronavirus, right?
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:22.880]   Yes.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.360]   Maybe.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   Maybe, I think.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.480]   I think we're going to find the coronavirus angle
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.280]   in every story.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   Yes.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.600]   It probably wouldn't be that difficult, to be honest right
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.100]   now.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.720]   It's so top of mind.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.560]   How about Stadia?
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.440]   Because there are--
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.440]   Don't touch the controller.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.840]   There could be German ads.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.080]   Just first of all, you want alcohol, wipe.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.960]   Any time you're picking up the controller,
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.960]   and don't touch your face, Google Stadia, apparently.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.320]   I mean, this launched-- what was it?
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.080]   Like five months ago was the soft launch,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.600]   or the launch to the founders.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.440]   Founders edition.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.840]   People who paid extra to get the founders edition
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.200]   and to be involved in an early stage
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.600]   were five months beyond the launch.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.920]   And I don't know.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.520]   It's pretty quiet on the Stadia front, I feel like.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   We expected that there was going to be some sort of a free tier
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   that Google has touted.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.880]   That hasn't happened yet, not necessarily-- not for anyone,
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.400]   anyways.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.680]   I think if you were the founder and your three month pro
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.640]   subscription ran out, you can opt to move that over
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.800]   to the free tier, which limits your resolution to 1080p.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.000]   So it has some drawbacks.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.360]   But still, it's a free monthly service at that point.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.880]   But that's not available to everyone, not yet.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.240]   And apparently, indie developers are not
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.000]   satisfied with what they're seeing out of Stadia.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.760]   They're saying, hey, Google has this new platform.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.320]   And as indie developers, we don't have unlimited resources.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.920]   So we need to know that there's something there for us
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.280]   if we spend our resources and our development costs--
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.360]   Show me the money!
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.320]   --to create this.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.880]   And how do companies incentivize that?
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.080]   Well, especially if it's a new platform,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.920]   they would offer monetary incentives
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.400]   so that they'd actually create these games for their platform.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.480]   And the developers say that's not happening with Google.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.680]   They're just not offering that much, not enough to make it
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.960]   worth it.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.720]   And they're also worried, by and large,
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.560]   about the fact that Google has a hard time committing
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.760]   to things.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.240]   And we see it time and time again.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.120]   They'll create something.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.680]   They're super excited about something.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.560]   I don't believe you.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.720]   And then a couple of years later--
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.480]   What examples do you have for this?
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.080]   I don't believe any.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.720]   You've never heard of this before.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.920]   No.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.760]   I'm sure if you went to kill by Google--
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.960]   I still use L--
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.360]   Alo's the greatest.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.720]   I'm going to go on Google+.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.520]   I'm going to give you help for that.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.600]   That Google reader, it's still.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.080]   Exactly.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.280]   There's three great examples for you.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.760]   So I don't know.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.680]   I think in the gaming world, even people
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.600]   who are really dialed into video games
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.280]   and really get excited normally about this sort of stuff,
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:10.400]   there's a lot of passivity around Stadia and what it offers.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.680]   And I think a lot of founders have let their subscriptions
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.760]   lapse like they've decided not to pay for the premium version.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.240]   Going forward, that spells a big--
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.080]   I don't know.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.040]   That's potentially not very difficult.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.560]   Kevin, hopeful, was a founders.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.560]   He did the founders thing.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.000]   I wonder if he let his labs.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.160]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.040]   I wonder if I had the wrong idea about Stadia
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.280]   and correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.200]   But I thought this was supposed to be a way of making online game
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.160]   in a little more mainstream versus what was--
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.720]   Yeah, I thought it was for casual people too.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.960]   But yet, it doesn't seem like any of this is working out
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.640]   because you've got to have the infrastructure and connectivity
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.520]   to give the game.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.680]   So then you're going to be paying just as much money
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.360]   for the game and content.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.200]   And then the gaming content isn't necessarily up to snuff.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.160]   Even casual gamers want to play a nice game and not
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.440]   an average game.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.920]   Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of the games that
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.640]   are on the platform are games that
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.720]   have been available on other platforms for however long.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.080]   So exclusivity is very minimal on the platform.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.120]   I think they have a couple of exclusive titles.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.080]   But from what I've seen, it's nothing that you look at it.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.840]   You're like, oh, that's the killer.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.760]   That's the game.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.840]   That's the one that's going to bring people over.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.960]   I think there's definitely a certain quality to Stadia
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.560]   that they hope to that being that there's this free tier.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.400]   And it's essentially-- it's a console
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   that doesn't require a console because it's just online--
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   that that would appeal to, let's say, new gamers or gamers
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.040]   who weren't already all in on one console or platform
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.200]   or another.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.480]   But again, like we're five months in,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.800]   and that free tier doesn't really exist for anyone yet.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   And we were talking about this a little bit last night
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.840]   on all about Android.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.480]   I think the big risk that Google runs on something like this
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.240]   is when it was launched and announced and then ultimately
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.880]   launched for the founders edition,
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.000]   there was a lot of attention being paid to it.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.560]   As far as, could this be the future of gaming?
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.080]   Had a lot of potential, let's say.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.360]   But now it's starting to get really quiet around Stadia.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.480]   You don't hear a lot of people talking about it.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.640]   There's just not of attention being paid to it.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   It's like they're missing out on that prime time
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.960]   that they could have capitalized off of the fact that here,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.120]   we have something new.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.200]   Everybody can use it and jump on while you're still
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.440]   thinking about it because now people are stopping.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.760]   I saw Stadia as something that someone like me could
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.960]   potentially try out because I'm not a bit gamer.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.320]   But every now and then, it would be fun to just sort of goof
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.040]   off and play something.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.800]   And it seemed like it would have been accessible.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.480]   You're choosing Carson and Gufe in off all the time?
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.760]   Well, that would be an accurate summation of what I love.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.600]   But even when we had it here and you were testing it out,
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.120]   for was it hands on tech, right?
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   It didn't really perform well.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.880]   And I'm thinking if it didn't perform well here
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.720]   on this network, I don't want to take a chance on my crappy home
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.560]   network.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.240]   But then I also started to think about--
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.320]   That was very early.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.880]   They made changes to improve that.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.560]   Then I also started to think about that is it Play Pass,
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.920]   on Android.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   I bought that.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.400]   And it just did nothing for me, so I let it go too.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:32.880]   Is this--
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.400]   Do you have a crappy home network?
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.800]   I think I have crappy upload, crappy download is OK,
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.160]   but crappy upload is just--
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.560]   There's no fiber to the home stuff there.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.760]   No.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.400]   No.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.760]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.520]   If you live in West Petaloma, you have a lot more access
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.440]   to fiber to the home through Sonic.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.200]   But wow.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.080]   Well, I don't live on the west.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.480]   I'm wrong side of town.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   I'm wrong side of the pilot.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.800]   I don't have access to that.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.240]   I'm actually-- I've just signed a contract with the devil.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.840]   Again, I'm going back to Comcast.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.520]   Because the speeds that I actually get through Sonic
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.600]   might-- my three or four year experiment with Sonic,
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.040]   because I wanted to do the right thing.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.160]   It's just time and time again, just running up
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.320]   into barriers with the fact that because it's not fiber,
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.000]   the home, it's fiber to the node,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.280]   and it's delivered via AT&T DSL.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:26.800]   You're right.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.680]   It's like, OK, so I'm happy to be with Sonic.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.920]   But it really sucks at times.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.280]   And I'm tired of running into that.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.400]   So I've signed a contract with the devil again.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.360]   Oh, man.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.720]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.600]   But anyway--
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.520]   But I just-- again, I just didn't
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.200]   know if this platform would stick.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.840]   If someone like me would try it out and say,
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.200]   that's OK, I'll pass.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.800]   It just didn't seem like it was going to give me
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.480]   a reason to stick around.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.840]   And now you're not even marketing the platform.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.680]   Not a lot of marketing.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.920]   I know they have a market in the apartment at Google, right?
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.080]   I would imagine.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.960]   No, they don't need you.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.680]   Every team has a person, and everyone hates the marketing
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.320]   people.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.840]   Kevin says he moved from the paid plan to the free plan.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.280]   So he can play the game city bot,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.200]   but he doesn't.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.080]   And that's not--
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.720]   And Kevin loves Google.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.800]   Yes.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.960]   I mean, in 1080p, might just be enough
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   for a lot of gamers, right?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.320]   But that's not good for Google.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.280]   Like Google wants you to find a lot of values
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.160]   that you're paying them on a regular basis.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.680]   Perfect world.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.480]   So don't know.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.640]   And I think the thought or the fear
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.360]   that Google might shut this down,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.200]   that's not an unfounded fear, right?
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.040]   I could totally see the future of a year and a half, two years
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.480]   from now.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.960]   Actually, we learned a lot of really good lessons.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.960]   And I'm sure we'll fold this technology into something
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.160]   coming up in the future.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.320]   I learned that before, too.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.480]   Well, we did hear that with inbox.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.000]   And they killed it.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.440]   But now they're rolling the inbox.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.640]   Features to Gmail.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.760]   I don't have to say, so some of the features are coming.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.680]   Maybe, so.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.480]   Supposedly.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.800]   There is hope.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.320]   In other words, don't get into Stadia just yet.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.720]   I mean, I don't know that you really can.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.040]   The ones you have about the issue right now,
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.120]   that's part of the problem.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.520]   So.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.240]   OK, you guys, do you want--
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.920]   should I go back to COVID-19?
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.560]   Just because I just got my King County health recommendations?
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:30.720]   OK.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   Share.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.320]   The guidance of the public, the King County Public Health
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.080]   Board, issued a thing just now saying,
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.240]   for workplaces and businesses, all employees
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.600]   should work from home if they are able.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.640]   Employers should take steps to make it more feasible for their employees
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   to work in ways that minimize close contact
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.520]   with large numbers of people.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.160]   They should maximize tele-community options,
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.640]   urge employees to stay home when they are sick,
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.840]   and maximize flexibility and sick leave.
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.760]   And consider staggering start and end times
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.960]   to reduce large numbers of people coming together
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.720]   at the same time.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.920]   For schools, do not cancel them unless there's
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.320]   been a confirmed case in the school.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.240]   And if you are a caregiver of a child with an underlying health
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   condition, you should consult with your health care provider
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.520]   whether or not they should stay home.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.680]   If they stay home, that's OK.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.960]   OK.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.240]   So that's going to trigger a lot of businesses to--
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.920]   it's going to force them, but very seriously encourages them
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.800]   to take a look at how their business is running
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.400]   to make changes that may or may not.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.480]   Oh, and it is saying that for event and community gathering
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.960]   considerations, if you could feasibly avoid bringing
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.680]   large groups of people together, consider postponing events
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.360]   and gatherings.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.440]   So that does come a con right there.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.120]   If you can't avoid bringing groups of people,
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.320]   urge people or sick not to attend,
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.480]   encourage those who are at higher risk for coronavirus
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.760]   not to attend, try to find ways to give people more physical space
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.200]   so they're not in close contact, clean surfaces,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.800]   and encourage attendees to wash their heads.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.040]   When is Comic Con?
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:06.840]   When is that at?
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.480]   It's the 14th.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   So it's--
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.840]   OK, everybody's behind the mask.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.040]   It'll be fine.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.160]   Actually, it's the 13th.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.240]   It starts the 12th.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.840]   And that's in Seattle.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.720]   It's in Seattle.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.800]   It's in real city Comic Con.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.120]   I'm so sad.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.760]   I'm glad we didn't cosplay it because my daughter and I
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:28.040]   were originally going to go as people from the Dragon Prince.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.040]   Si.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.760]   What's interesting about that, Stacey, too, is that,
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.640]   you know, like in Japan, they shut down the schools,
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.760]   but they didn't do anything.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.440]   What about the parents?
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.480]   What do you do?
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.880]   So in this case, they're kind of saying,
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.120]   well, the parents are sure to behold.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.640]   That's true.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.120]   They're--
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.440]   I mean, because, yeah, it is.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.760]   It's hard.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.400]   There's a couple of things to think about, right?
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.920]   Sometimes kids only get lunch and breakfast at school.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.880]   So when you shut down the schools,
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.560]   you're shutting down their access to nutrition.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.360]   Parents don't necessarily have a way to keep their job
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.840]   and keep an eye on their kid.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.280]   I mean, these are things--
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.720]   again, I'm not trying to be political,
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.680]   but there is a decided lack of any sort of safety net
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.160]   in our country that really makes this whole thing extra fraught
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:15.880]   for people who--
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.000]   Start with sick days, yep.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.520]   People who are sick will have to show up to work or the money.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.200]   And I kind of don't blame them.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.800]   They can't be cautious.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.920]   Right.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.080]   Let me talk about the restaurant industry
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.480]   just as one example, right?
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.240]   Like, that's an hourly industry.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.200]   If you don't show up, usually, and most of the restaurants,
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.760]   most of the restaurants that I ever worked in,
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.800]   in my restaurant career, you don't get paid
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.720]   if you don't show up.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.080]   Nope.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.520]   And so then, if that's your livelihood,
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.520]   and that's how you make your money, and not going there
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.360]   means you don't make a paycheck, then I imagine a lot of people
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.200]   choose to ultimately go there because they have to.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.640]   People still want food, shelter.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.200]   But they're also serving food.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.520]   Oh, man, it's just a messy situation.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.080]   Can't believe it.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:04.920]   Sorry to bring it back.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.800]   I just was like, ooh, breaking news, you guys.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   No, no, that is news.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.400]   Yeah, it is news.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.760]   You're ahead of the Seattle Times.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.160]   I don't find it there.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.440]   But you're still on for your presentation, right?
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.560]   Well, I'm waiting to see.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.200]   I mean, this literally came--
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.520]   this is the email that came in eight minutes ago from King
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.520]   County Public Health Department.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.920]   The way it all changes, it's so rapid right now.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.760]   Who the heck knows?
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.120]   Literally subscribing to King County Health Department?
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:27.800]   How did you know anything?
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.480]   Of course I am.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.360]   I don't subscribe to my channel.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.040]   I'm a journalist, Jeff.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.920]   I subscribed to every public body in my area.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.480]   No, I mean, don't you?
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.920]   No, because I don't cover my town.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.360]   But don't you want accurate information?
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.600]   I always listen, if I can, to the press conferences
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.240]   and look at things.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.640]   Because sometimes I'm sorry, local journalists, some of y'all
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.200]   are wonderful, but sometimes their headlines are misleading.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.640]   Or things aren't quite accurate.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.360]   I know it's not that.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.440]   It's not the journalist font.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.000]   A lot of times, that's the editor.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.560]   I know those editors.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.920]   Those damn editors.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.480]   That's why I blog.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.280]   So I got rid of editors.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.880]   I'm very happy.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.240]   Do you have a blog in here?
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.160]   Anything that you've blogged about recently?
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:17.680]   No.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   OK.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.200]   Oh, oh, Kevin did a great blog, everyone.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.080]   OK.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.360]   Kevin Tockel on Stacey on IoT, he blogged about how two weeks
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.040]   ago he was sick with the flu and how
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.520]   he used his voice assistant to avoid infecting everyone
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.400]   in his house so he didn't touch light switches.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.040]   He just used Google.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.560]   They actually moved from--
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.960]   they controlled their TV so that he didn't touch any remotes.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.680]   It's basically like how Kevin tried not to kill his family
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.560]   when he had the flu using smart home stuff.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.520]   A flu, not the flu.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.000]   Right.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.800]   Well, it was--
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.280]   I just thought through that.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.680]   Well, yeah, I know what you're saying.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.200]   Sorry.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   There's a new blue dot.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.800]   I was like, you know, the flu.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.840]   But yeah.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.720]   And at the end, he asked for a remote controlled hand sanitizer
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:05.960]   thing.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.640]   So I suggested one for him since I own one.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.400]   Wow.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.240]   Oh, so that he just puts his hand underneath.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.280]   [GASPS]
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.880]   Yeah, I have it because it's in my kitchen dispensing soap
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.600]   because I don't want chicken, like raw chicken juice
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.120]   on my soap dispenser.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   Yeah, OK.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:22.600]   You know.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.320]   I've wondered about that because I definitely have to--
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.200]   No, not because-- have you not seen me touching my face?
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.560]   I'm not germophobic at all.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.160]   I mean, I saw a couple of times.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.600]   I'll admit, I've touched my face since we started this show.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.640]   I did.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.200]   What?
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.680]   That's why his eyes are all red.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.960]   My eyeballs are about to fall out of my--
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   We need to put a skull.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.760]   --on your fingers so we can see the trace.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.120]   Right.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.480]   You only see it in black light.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.160]   That's the thing.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:50.880]   Exactly.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.320]   It's a shine of black light on it.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.560]   All right.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.320]   So sorry, we were talking about Stadia.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.000]   That's OK.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:52:59.680]   We may have talked it.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.600]   We were done talking about Stadia.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.800]   Yeah, I think we're not talking about Stadia.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.720]   Yeah, I always recuse myself in game stuff.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.800]   So I can come back now.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.880]   You can come back now.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.400]   Let's see here.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:12.200]   The Google News, I have to say, is pretty light this week.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.280]   They're all working from home.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:14.880]   They're all working from home.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.360]   They're all working from home.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.040]   There's smart fish.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.600]   Android is awesome.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.120]   Fish.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.400]   They're violating the privacy of fish.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.320]   The world around.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.520]   OK, we'll do fish, and then we'll do Android 1.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.720]   What you were talking about, of course,
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:31.040]   is alphabet unveiling title, which
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.120]   is not a high-res audio service, but a new moonshot
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.040]   that's targeting ocean conservation.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.960]   It's basically geared at--
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.520]   You could argue that J.C.'s title was a moonshot.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.040]   Sorry.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:44.520]   Funnled.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.040]   True.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:45.880]   Makes you--
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.520]   --raze-shot.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.120]   --raze-shot.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   OK.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.840]   It's monitoring fish behavior in this case with cameras.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.240]   And of course, it's Google.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.200]   So machine perception tools, AI.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:57.800]   Oh, oh.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.000]   Fish, fish, recognition.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.240]   I see it.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:00.840]   Yes.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.320]   Oh, no.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.840]   We're tracking all the mission to see.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:05.760]   I think this is cool.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.360]   This is where technology can actually improve our lives.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.240]   And by gosh, it's a good use case.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.120]   And there is actually a debate.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.160]   I think Rose Evele had an article
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.560]   in Wired about should we film animals without their consent.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.480]   But we're not going to go there right now with fish.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.120]   No.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.720]   You're kidding me.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.080]   You are kidding me.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.480]   It was about apes.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.040]   And I think it was apes.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.360]   Yes, that was an actual thing.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.120]   Should we film or use AI on animals without their consent?
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:37.640]   No.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.520]   No, not that.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.120]   Not the monkey selfie shot from--
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   Here, Rose Evele lived.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:44.880]   --however long I went to--
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.640]   It's a copyright dispute, exactly.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.000]   The copyright thing is separate.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.040]   Animals need digital privacy too.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.960]   Wired, January 31, 2020.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.880]   Oh, come on.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.480]   Why do you disagree, Mr. Jarvis?
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.720]   Read it before you start.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.440]   Why do you disagree, Mr. Jarvis?
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.960]   Well, in that case, let's really talk about animal rights.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.520]   Let's not kill any of them.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.840]   Let's not hold them prisoner.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.640]   You know, what about animal rights?
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.840]   Don't start with privacy.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.120]   Come on.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:13.840]   No.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.680]   No.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.320]   I'm feeling like I'm very old for it right now.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:16.800]   But no.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.280]   OK.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.520]   You should go read the article.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.480]   Yeah, and you disagree?
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.800]   No, I was just jerking to change.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   OK.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.920]   He saw an opportunity.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.080]   He's just going for it.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.880]   I'll bet if we look through your photos,
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.000]   we found you violated the privacy of a few cats.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Dogs, my dogs, they're always getting photos.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.040]   I know, so dare you.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.360]   I mean, is there such a thing as an animal providing consent
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.480]   for a photo?
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.680]   Like, it's not.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.400]   It's basically--
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.520]   Are you other than humans?
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.480]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.320]   The argument is more about our entitlement to animals
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.960]   and access to them.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.560]   OK, fair enough.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.880]   In the argument, it becomes when we see ourselves--
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.360]   or when people see animals as something,
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.080]   we should have access to 24/7.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.000]   We put both ourselves and them at risk.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.840]   And she says it doesn't extend it all the time to all the time.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.920]   But it's just a frame of thought.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.880]   And I think it's valid.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.240]   It's not as crazy as you might think.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.000]   You know, but on the other side of that,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.040]   why has there been any type of controversy for studying,
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   say, whale migration and any other animals
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.440]   that we have to figure out their patterns
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.400]   to know what their own patterns is for the rest of the wildlife
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.120]   circle and all of that?
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.200]   She talks about that.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.080]   She says we have to have--
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.600]   because when you start doing that,
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.560]   you can make them more vulnerable to being
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.080]   tracked by people who are maybe malicious, not just
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.680]   researchers, which is a problem.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.120]   So you have to weigh the harms.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.400]   I mean, it's like an IRB for animal studies.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.640]   Anyway, sorry.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.560]   We were going to talk about title.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.200]   And we just got so way late.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.360]   Now I'm like, I don't know about title.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.520]   Because I mean, you saw that video.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.080]   It was facial recognition.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:05.640]   I'm telling you.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.520]   Thousands upon thousands of fish.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.440]   That's pretty cool.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.640]   That is tracking these things.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.920]   None of them provided consent for this video.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.640]   It's tracking their swimming patterns.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.440]   It's tracking their--
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.560]   what are those called?
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.560]   Scale patterns.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.840]   I was like, their facial features is not what I was going for.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.400]   So you're tracking individual fish.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.880]   You're also tracking their behavior and ways.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.520]   And the goal is to make--
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.040]   yeah.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.000]   It's leaving them where they are and making sure they're happy.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.520]   Right.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.680]   And leaving them where they are being a really nice key
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.640]   fact there, right?
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.240]   Like still being able to study them without removing them
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.040]   from the environment in which they live.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.920]   And in a pretty non-invasive way, as far as I can tell,
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.600]   anyways.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.640]   So it's not like they're shooting a tag into the fish ear
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.360]   like we do with our cattle or anything like that.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.080]   Right.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:56.560]   Right.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.080]   Exactly.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:57.240]   I'll tell you.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   We're going to say with your cat.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.640]   And I'm like, whoa.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.360]   Someone's going to pee in your slippers.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.520]   That tag goes into the back of the neck.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.520]   Back.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.240]   Well, the little tracker--
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   It's not a tracker.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.480]   It's just it.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.520]   The tags or whatever that they inject into this skin.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.840]   I don't know what that's called.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.920]   Makes it sound a lot worse than it actually is.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.560]   But it allows you to find your last pet if they get lost.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.520]   That's why it's there.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.840]   OK.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.240]   Apparently, they've been building this for the past three years.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.760]   So yeah.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.680]   And now part of Alphabet's experimental kind of moonshot
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.320]   division is about making tools and interesting,
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:40.040]   creative, new concepts and stuff.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.400]   But it's also kind of about making money, right?
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.400]   We're starting to see them kind of tighten things down
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.240]   a little bit as far as moonshots that were launched.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.440]   But at some point, they're like, yeah,
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.640]   well, this isn't making any money,
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.000]   so we got to shut it down.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.960]   And that's good on them.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.880]   Put that one towards something.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.320]   Well, art is, it has more useful.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.320]   With Waymo, they just opened it up for outside investment.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.280]   And I think we're going to see more of that, correct?
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.040]   Yeah, probably so.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.440]   So that seems to be Google's MO under not such a--
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.280]   I'd love to get a veteran of Bell Labs and see--
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.360]   Thank you, Peter.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.320]   Sorry.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.040]   Sorry, Jeff.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:18.520]   Did me do--
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.520]   Sorry.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.560]   I didn't know that Stacy was embarrassing herself.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.040]   I thought I'd go up that door.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.120]   More importantly, too.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.040]   Good lord.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.760]   I'd be curious to get a veteran of Bell Labs
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.720]   and compare the attitude toward pure research
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:39.520]   and odd moonshots at both.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.760]   Because it was the vaunted--
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.360]   it was research in the corporation outside the university
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.400]   and it started the transistor and all this great stuff.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:50.000]   And Linux, Unix.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.720]   I wonder-- Google seems to be a little more financially
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.840]   targeted now than Bell Labs was.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.360]   Or I wonder two things like the fish is, OK,
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.480]   here's a little bit of pocket change.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.640]   You can play with that for a while,
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.920]   but then unless something comes up enough--
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.280]   Go play with your fish.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.720]   Well, I think that's what they've been.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.160]   I mean, the fish are three years old.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.000]   I think in two years, we'll be able to assess
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   what's changed since Porat started really killing
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.360]   these things like a year ago.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.640]   So I shouldn't just blame it on Ruth Porat.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.600]   That's rude.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.480]   So then I got dark.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.800]   And I had missed, by the way, thank you
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.360]   for mentioning the Waymo investment,
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.880]   because that was something that I completely missed.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.880]   I don't know what it needed.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   2.25 billion.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.800]   But right now, about 2.25 billion investment round.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.560]   Not bad.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.800]   OK.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.200]   Waymo as a division and as a project
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.560]   seems like it has a lot of legs compared
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.680]   to some of the other moon shots that have happened.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.240]   So it doesn't surprise me at all.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.760]   There's a lot of future there.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.560]   A lot of future there.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.680]   Do you think that because everyone else
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.240]   is investing in self-driving vehicles?
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.680]   Or do you--
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.480]   and I'm just curious, what about it
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.120]   makes you feel like there's a future where something like title
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.520]   doesn't feel like it has a future?
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.360]   No, no.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.320]   And I'm not actually saying that about title.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.720]   I don't know enough about oceanography
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.160]   and all that kind of stuff to even make that guess.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.800]   I just feel like Waymo-- yeah, I feel like five years
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.760]   from now, my guess is it's going to feel a lot more normal,
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.600]   a lot more common.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.680]   And Google's been doing this for a while,
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.400]   so it makes sense for them to continue
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.480]   to find investment to continue that technology growth.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.720]   They've been doing it for a while.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.680]   And like Ms. Stacey said, everybody else
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.680]   seems to be investing in it too short.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   There's a lot of optimism and that's--
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.320]   optimism and that's--
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.560]   --signal that we need to keep rolling.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.320]   Right, exactly.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:50.720]   If Google is going to say this experimental offshoot
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.640]   from this division is going to continue on,
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:01.280]   it's got to have some sort of benefit, some sort of signal
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.040]   that it actually has the ability to make money
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.520]   for the company in the long run.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.960]   And I feel like Waymo has that potential, has that ability.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.000]   It's in Vegas, right?
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.040]   Am I thinking correctly?
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:13.560]   Waymo?
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.480]   Where it's based?
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.440]   Yes.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.760]   I thought it was based in California.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.880]   They have their tests in Arizona.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.880]   Right.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.360]   Right.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.520]   I think something was in Vegas, like the head
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.560]   tracks out near Vegas in the desert.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.000]   They may.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.360]   I mean--
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.000]   I could be well.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.640]   Maybe it was there.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.920]   No, they have stuff in Vegas.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.880]   They have stuff in Arizona and they have stuff in California
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.240]   as well.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.520]   OK.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.320]   Yes.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:35.720]   Oh, no.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.280]   Yes, no, maybe.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.000]   Waymo in Phoenix says Scooter X in a chat.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.600]   They're definitely in Phoenix.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   Definitely in Phoenix.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.520]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.520]   I'm fine.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.880]   I'm going to see it.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.000]   Let's see here.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.720]   Android 1.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:00.720]   So this is Google's program to bring more, say,
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:07.160]   lower to low mid-tier phones to different markets that also
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:12.360]   carry Google's commitment to updates, commitment to quality,
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.040]   that sort of stuff.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.520]   But primarily, it's really about receiving updates and everything.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.640]   There was an article posted on notebookcheck.net
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:25.520]   by Alex Alderson, who writes about how, in his assessment,
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.240]   the Android 1 program is a shambles, as his headline says,
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.840]   that primarily what this revolves around
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.560]   is the fact that the promise was always two years--
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.120]   two years of guaranteed updates for Android 1 devices.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.200]   Later, they changed the verbiage on the site
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.600]   to at least two years of OS upgrades.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.760]   And what he's trying to figure out is, OK, so a phone comes out
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.440]   and it immediately gets an OS update.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.000]   Let's say it came out two months before an OS update.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.760]   Then a year later, it gets a second OS update.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.720]   That's still a year and a couple of months
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.480]   from the time that it was actually launched.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.080]   But it doesn't end up getting anything beyond that.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.040]   I think, I think, really, his argument really
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.840]   seems to be, what are the definitions here?
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.360]   And does this show that the commitment around Android 1
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:20.200]   is actually not being held to the standard that it needs to be?
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.440]   Sounds like yet another project that Google has given up on.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.600]   I don't know.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.160]   Gosh.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.880]   Do you think it's given up on it?
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.120]   I mean, how much is Google getting out
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.320]   of this emerging market at this point?
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.040]   Well, man, it was just a couple of years
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.680]   that they felt like the emerging markets was the next billion
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.160]   users.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.240]   I mean, it was huge.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.640]   Having heard that buzzword in how many years now?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.360]   Well, I mean, a couple of years.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.200]   Yeah, I suppose.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.440]   But just what exactly is happening with it?
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.240]   I wonder.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.160]   I don't know.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.320]   Your thoughts, Miss Stacy?
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:57.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.280]   I just was starting to count how many times
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.480]   Jason touched his face.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.840]   Oh, that's it.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.760]   You notice I'm holding my laptop just in the back.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.560]   So you not touch my face.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.040]   I'm sitting here.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.040]   Oh, is that how you do it?
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:10.560]   You touch her.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   You hold onto your laptop?
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.120]   I did, seriously.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:12.920]   I'm sitting here holding--
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.680]   Your laptop is so filthy dirty.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.360]   Everything that you would be putting on your faces
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.160]   on your laptop.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.520]   But I'm trying to keep my hands off my face.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.000]   So I've been sitting here like this for the last couple
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.560]   of minutes just to see if it works.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.200]   But there was a picture in the Washington Post
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.560]   of a woman on her train wearing a--
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.120]   on a bar, wearing her mask and with rubber gloves typing.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.040]   So you know she's using the gloves to touch all these surfaces
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.000]   and then just making her laptop a horrible surface
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.680]   of these terms.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.560]   Oh, that's like when people at restaurants,
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:48.080]   they are handling money so they have gloves on to make
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.880]   her sandwich and then they handle the money with the gloves
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.520]   and they're like, no, no, that's--
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.160]   No, no, no, you do it wrong.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.680]   Yeah, you do it wrong.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.960]   So if you were counting about what number was I at?
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.560]   Was I like five or--
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.800]   Well, so I was only counting for this one section.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.440]   But you were at least three in.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.080]   It's a thing that I do.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.080]   It's really hard.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.080]   I do it all the time.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.080]   You do not do it.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.640]   Oh, it's really hard to do not do it.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.760]   We need laptops that I can just look at and scroll
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.920]   and maybe you can like--
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.560]   Well, they'll get inside your brain soon enough.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.800]   See, and you'll welcome that when it comes.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.720]   You will welcome it.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.480]   If it works right, if it works better than the radar
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.520]   on my Pixel 4, then maybe then--
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.280]   oh, hey, we can talk about that.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.360]   Oh, yes.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.640]   This is-- that's my computer.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.880]   But-- oh, and I don't need to show it up.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.920]   The Pixel-- I don't even know if this made it in here.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.040]   The Pixel-- are we all on pixels?
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:47.680]   I know you are.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.320]   Did you get the Pixel update?
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:52.320]   What happened?
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:52.840]   What is it?
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840]   What is it?
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.840]   Feature drop.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840]   Feature drop.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.840]   Oh, oh.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840]   So basically they'd say--
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840]   So this is the second time that they've done this.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.200]   They did it first last December where they announced,
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.960]   every once in a while we're going to release a feature drop
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.080]   for the Pixel.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.400]   And we're going to bring new capabilities to your phone.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.040]   And it's going to be like you got a big update.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.680]   And this time around, I went to do-- check for my update.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.520]   And it came through as like a security update.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.680]   So I was like, oh, that's not it.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.440]   Maybe I need to get the security update.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.120]   And then I will download the feature update.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.200]   But it was baked in with the security update.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.320]   And it adds--
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.440]   I mean, a handful of features.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.160]   One of the key features, I would say,
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:36.640]   that I saw a lot of people tweeting about is like AI generated
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.920]   force touch?
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.520]   Or what is it?
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.240]   3D touch.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.160]   So on iPhones and not the iPhone 11,
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.240]   I think they stopped doing this on the iPhone 11.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.000]   But it used to have this pressure sensitive display
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.840]   where you could press hard and get it
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.800]   like a faster contextual message or something.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.680]   Well, Google is doing it with software.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.960]   So it totally does work where if you tap lightly,
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.440]   maybe the menu pops up a certain speed.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.120]   But if you tap harder, it pops up faster.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.800]   And I think the AI must be detecting
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.160]   how much of your finger is pushing into the screen or something.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.040]   I'm not really quite sure how they do it exactly.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.880]   But it's kind of interesting.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.760]   Yeah, I think at the verge, they called it
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.360]   how hard you're smooshing it.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.960]   Yeah, you're smooshing it right because your finger--
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.840]   Smoosh.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.560]   The smoosh back.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.280]   It sends out a little bit when you do that.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:26.640]   It's not really doing it for me.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.280]   I got the update.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.480]   I was telling Mr. Howell before it showed the update came through.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.440]   And I totally forgot about it.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.120]   And I went to do a screenshot to share with the family.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.960]   And the screenshot interface was different.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.720]   So I was like, whoa, what the heck just happened?
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.320]   But that was one of the features in the update,
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.880]   is when you double tap the power button,
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.080]   get these extra cards and things like that.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.560]   They don't do a good job of telling us
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.800]   what's at an update.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.720]   Well, that's true.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.040]   I mean, you wouldn't know that there
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.440]   were new features on your phone if you didn't read the article.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.640]   It didn't give a pop up to say, hey, your pixel just got better.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.960]   And Google--
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.920]   That's Google.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.880]   That's that lack of marketing department.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880]   That's it.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880]   Yep.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880]   By the way, we also--
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.560]   It's already been pulled on AT&T.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.560]   The update has--
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.600]   The update has already been pulled off of AT&T
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.880]   for some reason or another.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   Wow.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.360]   Well, I just pulled my phone down.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.440]   So Virgil mentioned in chat asking a question,
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.560]   is call screening automatic now?
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.360]   I didn't read that anywhere, but I've noticed it.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.080]   Ever since the update, now suddenly when calls come through
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.640]   that it doesn't recognize, it immediately
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.720]   jumps into call screening.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.400]   So I see it working.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.400]   Cool.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.880]   Because mine still gives me the option of--
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.560]   after I hang up on it, it's like, do you
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.840]   want to turn on call screening?
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.960]   I never got that option.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.320]   I always--
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.240]   Maybe you turn it off manually at some point?
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.280]   Me?
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.680]   I feel like I never had that on.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.040]   And now suddenly my phone's doing it all the time.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.160]   So I don't know what happened.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.920]   It must be a setting that has changed.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.320]   But I know I never--
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.520]   I just never really got any much benefit out of call screening.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.960]   So I never use it.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.480]   I did.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.040]   But now suddenly it's doing it on all these unknown calls.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.840]   All the robo calls were really getting stopped for me.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.840]   But now the robo calls are getting blocked before they even
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.600]   ring my phone.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.160]   I'll just see a missed call.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.480]   Your robot's fighting with another robot on you.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.680]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.000]   Robot wars.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.320]   Robot wars that you never have to see.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.800]   Right.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.320]   That's the promise of the internet right there.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.000]   An artificial intelligence.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.800]   Yes.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.720]   A dark theme, sunset to sunrise option.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.040]   That's for you, Jeff.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040]   No.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.200]   Go away.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.960]   Leave up alone.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.480]   Car crash detection is now active.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.240]   That's great.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.200]   So if your phone detects that you've been in a car crash,
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.080]   it will give you the opportunity to tap or use your voice
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.400]   to call 911.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.520]   It will share location data and details with first responders
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.120]   if you happen to be unresponsive.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.040]   So that's good news there.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   Like you said, Google Pay.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.160]   So if you press and hold--
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:05.680]   let's see here.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.400]   Let me unlock.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.480]   If you got the overhead, I can show this off from a distance.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.760]   If I press and hold my power button,
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   I get a new interface up here, which is my Google Pay option.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.720]   So if I had more than one card, I could swipe to the right card.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.480]   And then when I use it on Terminal,
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.880]   it would use the card that's showing.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:29.000]   Instead of having to launch the Google Pay app
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.520]   to select a payment card.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.200]   So that's handy.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.400]   I use that just yesterday, actually.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.840]   Are you still using your bubbles?
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.000]   Are those the bubbles that tell you
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.160]   how much time you've been spending on things?
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.840]   Yeah, I am still using that.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.920]   I never--
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.480]   Do you find it helpful?
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.840]   I mean, I find that no matter how much or how little I use
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.200]   my phone, by the end of the day, it's still always
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.120]   stacked up there.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   I think the way I'm guessing the way that it uses it
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.000]   is the amount of time in between locks
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.480]   creates larger bubbles.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.360]   And so the whole screen is 24 hours.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.720]   I'm not really quite sure.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:04.080]   But it seems like on days where I'm not using it nearly
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.720]   as much as other days, it still fills all the way up there.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.960]   I'm like, well, how is that?
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.800]   Yeah, that's not helpful.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.840]   It's not a good metric.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:13.720]   I mean, I guess if I sat there and counted the number of bubbles,
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.720]   it'd be like, oh, there's less.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.040]   It kind of is your job.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.360]   But yes, it is.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:18.760]   It is.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.560]   But it's nice to know that sometimes I'm not--
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.600]   Well, that means you're actually doing your job every day.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.000]   Leo's supposed to be very proud of you.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   I suppose so.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   Yes.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:27.500]   Yes.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.600]   I don't know how many of that happens.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.440]   I think your bubbles are too low right now.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.720]   I don't think you've been doing enough.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.520]   I think Leo will leave town and see what happens.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.440]   See what happens?
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.280]   I slack.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:39.000]   No, that's because I was looking at an actual computer screen
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.480]   instead of my phone.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.280]   So that's where I was reading all these stories.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.320]   Yeah, sure.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.440]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.200]   Don't tell Leo.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.320]   Seriously, don't tell Leo.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.800]   You are Dr. Android.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.160]   You were supposed to move them.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.320]   Widget right now.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.280]   Remove that home screen.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.920]   Let's take a break.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.240]   We've got a few more things.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.520]   We've got the-- of course, we have the change log
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.360]   and a few other things that I'm sure we can touch on.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.160]   And then tips, tricks, and all that stuff.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:06.800]   Don't touch.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.640]   Whatever it is, don't touch it.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.800]   Before we go there, I'm going to thank this sponsor of this week
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.400]   in Google that is LastPass.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.360]   Securing every access point in your business is critical,
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.800]   but it's challenging for IT to improve security
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.440]   without impacting employee productivity.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   And LastPass, we love LastPass.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.120]   It provides you with a balance of strong security
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.800]   that's also easy for your employees to use
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.680]   and manage on their own.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.080]   With LastPass, employees benefit from a solution
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:41.320]   that's easy to use while IT maintains control over every login.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.520]   LastPass offers multiple solutions for businesses.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.520]   LastPass identity unifies password management,
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.520]   single sign-on, and biometric multi-factor authentication
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.880]   into one single solution.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.640]   So you get a number of things along with that--
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.760]   adaptive authentication, which combines biometric and contextual
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.920]   intelligence to actually prove a user's identity
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.560]   with a variety of flexible MFA options.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.920]   You can eliminate passwords even.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.200]   You can leverage biometrics and integrations
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.000]   to streamline access to work applications
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.320]   without ever having to type a password, which is nice.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.160]   It secures every access point from web applications
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.640]   to workstations and VPN.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.240]   You can manage every access point in your business.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:31.000]   LastPass identity offers over 1,200 pre-integrated SSO
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.240]   applications, so you can get users up and running quickly.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.800]   You can deploy it instantly.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.240]   You also get granular controls without all the hassle.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.960]   So you can leverage more than 100 policies
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.000]   to manage users at the app, individual, group,
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.520]   or organizational level to see that you can customize access
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.080]   and authentication requirements.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.280]   And LastPass goes above and beyond
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.240]   to ensure security for all of its users.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.000]   Your data is, of course, encrypted and decrypted
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.480]   at the device level.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.840]   You have a master password and the keys
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.160]   that are used to decrypt the data, all that stuff.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.760]   It's never sent to LastPass servers
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.920]   and are never accessible by LastPass.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.440]   And as the gold standard, they engage trusted world class
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.320]   third-party security firms to conduct routine audits
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.240]   and testing of their service and infrastructure.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.560]   Like I said, we use LastPass here at Twit.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.160]   We love it.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.200]   I've been using LastPass for years.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.760]   It's really improved my password health.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.560]   I don't really have to think about it anymore.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.040]   It's just always running there, generating secure passwords
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.360]   for me, saving them to the right place.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.520]   Logging into sites is easier than it's ever been.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.640]   And I still know that I'm protected even when it's that easy.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.080]   Increased security does not have to be complex.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.120]   LastPass makes identity and access management simple for IT
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.720]   to manage an easy-to-use for employees.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.160]   So you can start your journey today
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.320]   by visiting lasspass.com/twit.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.000]   Do that, and you can find out how they can help you.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.600]   That's lasspass.com/twit.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:10.280]   And we thank LastPass for their support of this week in Google.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.760]   All right, outside of the Googly things, what else do we
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.000]   have here?
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.560]   We've got Twitter under threat.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.840]   Twitter under threat, actually.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.320]   Yeah, that's kind of a big deal.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.000]   Jack Dorsey in the Crosshairs, Paul Singer,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.120]   a major Republican donor, apparently purchased
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.480]   a large stake in Twitter.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.960]   With the hope of ousting him, is this a stated goal of Singer?
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.160]   Well, the question is, is it a political ousting
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.240]   or a financial ousting?
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.680]   Right.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.200]   You know, it's a standard case of somebody
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.600]   investing in a company to be an activist.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.560]   But I'm not sure what kind of activist that is,
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.240]   what the load of is behind it.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.600]   Yeah, shares, apparently, rose on the news of this.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.080]   So Wall Street seems to be saying--
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.200]   However, employees, of course, started a hashtag.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.000]   That's right.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   That's right.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.120]   We back Jack.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.240]   Hashtag, we back Jack.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:10.160]   So I don't know where this leads.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.720]   How much-- How much could this large investment
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.440]   influence anything, other than saying, hey, I'll just
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.040]   take my money and run kind of thing.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.640]   Twitter is still going to move on if he decides to take
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.800]   their money and run.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.480]   When you get enough of an activist investment,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.880]   they can have an impact on the board.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.560]   The board can fire the CEO, and they
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.160]   can put in somebody friendly to a different way
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.360]   to run things.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.040]   And they can force us all to read Donald Trump's tweets.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.720]   So like a lot of times, we have crappy board members.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.440]   Or you just--
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.440]   Or new crappy board members.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:43.920]   That's probably--
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.440]   Yeah, really.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.320]   It's an activist investor comes in by their shares.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.680]   They then send out-- they do usually a letter writing
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.760]   campaign.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.880]   And then they also-- like, to all the shareholders, which
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.960]   can include normal people.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.360]   And they also try to bring other board members in--
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.320]   because-- not just board members,
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.840]   but they bring the other investors around.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.080]   And then those investors try to influence the board.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.000]   And the idea is that you would profit by doing this,
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   usually.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.600]   OK.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.880]   And the board now has some good people on it.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:16.480]   Omen Kordestandi, Patrick Pashett, who
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:22.320]   was a former CFO of Google, Martha Lane Fox, who
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:28.040]   the House of Lords, and started a major media online media
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.160]   effort in the UK.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.680]   Brett Taylor, who I like a lot, who
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.400]   used to be CTO of Facebook, is now
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.640]   chief operating officer at Salesforce.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.200]   You know, it's a distinguished board, I would say.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.880]   Well, if there's some--
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.320]   The other thing is, Twitter is saying
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.480]   that they're going to introduce-- what is it called?
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:49.680]   It's--
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.200]   Fleece?
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:50.680]   Fleece?
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:50.680]   Fleece?
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.200]   Fleece?
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.200]   Fleece.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:52.720]   Fleece.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.760]   Did you say poison?
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.280]   No, I'm not.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.040]   I'm not posting pills.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.280]   I thought we were still on the financial thing.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.160]   I hadn't seen that.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:57.440]   All right.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.320]   Oh, no, they have it.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.320]   I don't think they've actually--
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.200]   I had to keep dumb.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:01.720]   Sorry.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.120]   I was like--
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.160]   Sorry, back to features.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.960]   Out of finance and back to features.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.520]   Twitter is testing tweets.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.640]   Well, they're not really tweets.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.360]   They're stories, essentially, that disappear after 24 hours.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.000]   They're calling them Fleece, I think, as in fleeting.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.840]   Clever name.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.440]   Clever.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.160]   But it is totally basically stories.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.080]   You get the very story-like row of circular avatars
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.760]   up at the very top.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.040]   And you would only really find these
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.160]   if you went to someone's profile and tapped into them.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.120]   If I'm reading this right, or maybe it's
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.600]   you go to your own profile, and then you've
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.920]   got all the people that you follow.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.440]   They're Fleece up there.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.280]   I'm not really quite sure.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.680]   It's testing in Brazil at the moment.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.160]   Videos can be up to two minutes and 20 seconds for everyone,
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.960]   except white listed publishers get up to 10 minutes.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.760]   Of course, the influencers.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.480]   Yes, exactly.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.760]   If I have to do quarantine, I want access to this
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.560]   so I can make Fleece of my quarantine life.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:01.920]   OK.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.120]   Ooh, I want that.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.200]   That could be your next rise, your next career rise.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.320]   You could be an early adopter of Twitter's Fleece
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.640]   and really capitalize off of being there from there.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.320]   Really capitalize, yes.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:19.840]   It helped me immensely being early into Google+, yes.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.480]   We see where that got us.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.160]   Rest may Google+ forever rest at peace.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:28.480]   I was thinking of quitting my job and just going to Google+.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.120]   Really?
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.360]   I mean, hey, in the early days--
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360]   I saw a part of this.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   It was great.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.280]   It was great.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.760]   I mean, it was happening in our circles.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.600]   I don't know about everybody's circles.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.160]   No one was adding anyone to their circles, so I don't know.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.240]   Yeah, speaking of this morning, Tom Brokaw and Mike Barnacle
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.600]   were on MSNBC complaining about,
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.160]   Twitter is just not representative.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.880]   And I think, and you two are?
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.320]   Oh.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.280]   You know?
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.400]   Yeah, so--
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.760]   Do not get me started.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.800]   Just don't go there.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.880]   Oh, in your own bottle.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.400]   Oh.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.840]   And so, yeah.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.360]   So we use the things we like to use.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.160]   And I hope Twitter's thing works really well.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.600]   And I hope people find a home there and enjoy it.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.120]   But Stacey, I don't want you to do it there,
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.120]   because I don't want it to fly away.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.160]   I want the full record.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.680]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.440]   No, no, but if it's asleep, it dies.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.280]   Oh, no, that's true.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.080]   I think if I'm under quarantine,
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.360]   that's what should happen, because I'm going to get real punchy.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.960]   I like FM reality.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.360]   I'm going to be like--
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.080]   You don't want to record.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.720]   Remember when Stacey went nuts, which
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.720]   she was stuck in her house for two weeks?
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.720]   Oh, we have her stories now.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.320]   What did she stick on her head that time?
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.040]   Oh, we have our memories.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:42.800]   Exactly.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.320]   That's a future.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.360]   We can't show any of it, but it was good.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.360]   I can't prove it now.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   Yes.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:47.880]   Yeah, right.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.440]   It's real.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.800]   What do you do about walking the dog, Stacey,
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.560]   if you're in quarantine?
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.960]   Can you walk the dog?
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:55.800]   Yeah, there's not-- I mean, of course you can.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.840]   As long as you can't-- you've just
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.640]   got to stay six feet away from people.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.400]   Your neighbors are all never run away from you.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.720]   Well, if I'm the only person under quarantine because I'm
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.560]   sick, someone else might have to walk the dog because I'm
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.640]   going to be sick.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.960]   No, you're not going to get sick.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.440]   You're healthy.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.520]   You're Stacey.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.600]   The dog's not going to get sick, right?
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.120]   The dog is over here snoring.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:17.680]   Do y'all hear her?
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.680]   No.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.320]   OK, good.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.920]   She's doing those little cute--
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.560]   Those are great.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.040]   Those are great.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.960]   I love those.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.200]   You have a tiny horse.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.200]   Very nice horse.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.360]   There she is, Aunt.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.160]   Can you see her?
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.120]   She's curled up in the--
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.040]   You're lower third.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.120]   Take away the lower third.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:35.560]   Just barely.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.040]   Oh.
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.040]   Aw.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.960]   Yeah, that's a cozy down there.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.720]   A little ball of love.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.600]   A good life.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.120]   It's cozy.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.160]   What kind of dogs do you have, Aunt?
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.760]   I have a 12-year-old.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.920]   I think he's 12 years old.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.960]   Chihuahua, teacup chihuahua.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.880]   I wouldn't have guessed that for a second.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.840]   Well, that's not really my dog.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.320]   I'll say it.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:58.840]   Oh, OK.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.760]   It's not really my dog.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.760]   My dog is Kylo.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.080]   He's a four-year-old pit bull and a massive mix.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.400]   OK, that's more the speed.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.320]   I thought.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.440]   I didn't see he was a Chihuahua guy.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.080]   Put the little--
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.640]   I walked him both there.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.760]   I was going to say, they probably make a good team.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.080]   I walked them both, and we get along just fine.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.040]   They know who feeds them.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.080]   Yeah, right.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.440]   My Chihuahua pug is full of hate.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.480]   Full of hate.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.320]   Surprise.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:32.840]   Is she a chug?
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.600]   For prize.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.400]   Surprise.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.240]   No, she's a ch--
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.240]   ch-- yeah, I guess she's a chug.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240]   Don't bother.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.440]   You're like, I can do these two.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.840]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.840]   The pihuahua.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   The pihuahua.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:47.840]   The pihuahua.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:48.840]   Chug.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.440]   The pihuahua.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.680]   Yeah, she's a chug.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.280]   Yeah, chug means more sense.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.360]   And she hates it.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.600]   Libra, the dream is fizzling.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.200]   Facebook's--
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.080]   We have our lead new year.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.720]   Facebook's dream of Libra.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.680]   The cryptocurrency is-- wow, it's just fading away.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.080]   Apparently, they're going to start supporting existing
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.600]   currencies along with the Libra token.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.280]   The Libra token will not be the centerpiece anymore.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.680]   And there's just been so much regulatory interest
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.120]   and attention that Facebook has been receiving on this.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:29.440]   So they're delaying the launch of the Calibra digital wallet.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.520]   And it's hard to even know really what Libra is anymore.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.680]   Doesn't that mean anyone?
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.680]   I mean, I'm like, oh, good.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.920]   I feel like this is OK.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.760]   Yeah, I think it's good.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.600]   I think it's just fine.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.920]   Lower the hubris notches.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.600]   Yes.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.640]   A few steps on them, and I think that's fine.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.480]   Facebook has other things to worry about,
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.840]   like censoring political ads and stuff.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.200]   They don't have time to worry about this cryptocurrency.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.880]   Cryptocurrency.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:56.440]   That's true.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.280]   Until they start Facebook nation.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:58.720]   You know.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.200]   Right.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:09.600]   I take over-- I figured last night that where did Bloomberg win?
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.600]   American Samoa.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.600]   American Samoa.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.040]   American Samoa.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.520]   I figured he bought it.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.560]   That's how he won.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:16.840]   So now we can sell it to Facebook.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.480]   And then we can set up a nation there.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.920]   It's the Facebook-- yeah.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.680]   Now you can actually visit Facebook.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:24.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.480]   Just go there.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.480]   Just wash your hands for us.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.720]   There is no coronavirus at Facebook, on Facebook.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.920]   I don't know about it in Facebook, but--
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:33.600]   Awesome.
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.480]   Anyways, Daily Caller is a Facebook fact checker.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:40.600]   We've heard about this months ago when Facebook started--
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.760]   The Nazi publication?
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.760]   The Daily Caller, yeah.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.200]   Different Daily Caller.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:45.960]   Oh, OK.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:46.760]   Different Daily Caller.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:48.240]   No, that's the Daily Stormer.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.800]   Daily Stormer, there we go.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.800]   OK, I was like, really?
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.200]   They're both named the same thing?
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.080]   But yeah, you're right.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.480]   Daily Stormer, Daily Caller, two different things.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.440]   I'm sorry, y'all.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440]   Good.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:58.960]   Good.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   Good correction.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   Good.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440]   You said no, you're out.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:02.960]   Wait, wait.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.800]   So which one did Facebook verify?
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   What's that?
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.040]   Wait, which one did Facebook--
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.080]   Daily Caller to their fact check.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.000]   Yes.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.280]   Because there's this constant belief
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.400]   that there's some kind of neutrality in the world.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.080]   And so they had to get fact checkers from the right,
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.200]   because all the right was screaming
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.400]   about all the fact checkers were liberal,
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.600]   and in fact they are.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.000]   So call that a fact, call that an opinion.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.160]   So then--
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:24.920]   And so here we go.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:29.040]   Daily Caller was the fact checks were from what I was told,
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.840]   kind of, OK-ish.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.320]   But then trouble hit this week.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:34.840]   Indeed.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.360]   When Trump said--
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.120]   used the word hoax in relation to the virus,
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.000]   the Democrats were saying he was calling the virus a hoax.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.240]   Trump was saying, no, I was calling them what the Democrats
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.640]   were saying about it a hoax.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:51.520]   The Daily Caller came in and fact checked and did it
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.960]   on Trump's side.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.320]   And then people were having a fit about this with Facebook
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.400]   now.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.080]   So they're caught in where they're always caught in the ringer.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.840]   They're always in the crossfire.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.720]   The problem here is that we have a president who
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.880]   is willing to just straight up lie all the time.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.840]   I mean, really, that's--
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.520]   I don't know.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:15.520]   I mean, I know all politicians twist the truth,
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.920]   but when someone just outright lies,
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.920]   you can't even--
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.440]   that's not even lying through statistics
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440]   where you're like, oh, just tweak it a little too.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.920]   I'll just explain it this way instead.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.880]   Yep, exactly, exactly.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.960]   Well, yeah, that's the problem.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.080]   So Alex Stamos said the other day on Twitter,
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.600]   the problem with disinformation is it usually is not untrue.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.920]   It uses some things.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.760]   It was true or something that was said,
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.160]   and then puts it on the spin cycle.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.480]   And so the whole notion that fact-checking
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.800]   is going to kind of solve the world ain't going to save us,
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.280]   folks.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.640]   Yeah, it's important to have fact-checking.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:50.320]   Of course it is.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320]   I'm not against fact-checking.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.160]   No, I'm a journalism teacher.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.880]   But I'm fine with fact-checking.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:57.520]   But it's not the solution to those who would--
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.080]   it's not alone the solution to those
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.920]   who would manipulate fact and disinformation.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.800]   So also, what we have going on here is a fight over--
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.080]   yes, that's what he meant.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.160]   No, he didn't.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:09.640]   Right.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.560]   In fact, it wasn't.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.600]   Yeah, who has the definitive--
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:16.240]   there really is no definitive in that situation.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:16.560]   But if you--
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:16.960]   But if you--
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.840]   But if you're checking was black and white, though.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.600]   Well, the last four years have seemed
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.360]   to prove that facts aren't really facts.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.040]   Which is weird.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.040]   That seems to be how a lot of people feel, though,
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.920]   is that what truly is a fact.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.920]   What is a fact when you take a headline that says,
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.160]   Trump calls coronavirus Democrats new hoax,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.480]   and you combine that with what Trump actually said.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:47.400]   And apparently, facts are interpretations.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:47.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.880]   This is a part.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.380]   Oh, shit.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:51.360]   In the case of this, that's exactly what it is.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   Facts are interpretations.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.120]   I mean, because within the last 40 seconds,
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.240]   I said a thought fact--
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.760]   fact-checking was black and white.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.160]   That's a fact, right?
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.760]   I said that within the last 40 seconds.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.840]   You said that, yes you do.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.360]   We've got recorded history of it here.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:06.640]   Right.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.800]   So what's the difference with--
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.800]   I don't think that happened, actually.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.680]   I'm a dick gummy.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:13.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.120]   Producers.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.040]   I think you called fact-checking a cookie.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.760]   But you see what I'm saying?
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.840]   If this is--
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:22.120]   Yes.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:27.400]   Especially with regards to Donald Trump and Twitter,
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.200]   that's digital.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.520]   That's black and white.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:30.520]   One's and zero's.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:33.440]   I don't get why a lot of this stuff that comes out
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:38.600]   of this person's keyboard could be an issue,
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.080]   as far as it being factual and versus hearsay
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.400]   or interpretation.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:47.120]   Now, if this was something on a TV screen that had recorded tape,
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.920]   recorded film, what's the difference?
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.720]   Well, I guess AI takes--
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.920]   I mean, well, yeah, there's that.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.920]   That poses a whole other issue.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.840]   But there are plenty of examples of even Donald
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:06.040]   Trump on video saying something that is factually incorrect.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.160]   But still, we end up in the same place.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.600]   And I'm numb to it now.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.680]   I'm not even surprised that it happens anymore.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.280]   I hate that.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.120]   Dana Boyd, who's a brilliant researcher at Dana Society in New
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.200]   York, says that we are in an epistemological war.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.840]   That is to say that if I don't like Jason,
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.360]   I hate Jason, then I don't like Jason's facts.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.600]   And that's kind of where we are right now.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.160]   And--
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.720]   So true.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.400]   So you can get a common base of facts,
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.680]   and then still-- everybody can still fight and yell and kill
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:41.880]   about them.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.720]   Yes.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.160]   I wish--
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:43.720]   I wish--
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:44.880]   That were the case.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.080]   But--
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:46.760]   Woody and the--
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.120]   --retrain the Kelly Anne Conway was right.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:52.520]   Woody in the chat room says, language is more subtle than black
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.160]   and white.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.320]   And I guess it is, language.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:58.960]   But I don't know.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:02.120]   I am wearing a red shirt with black letters on it.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:02.480]   That's the fact.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.280]   I actually thought it was kind of orange, myself.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.040]   Maybe it's to be pink.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.040]   Maybe not sure, man.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:07.800]   I don't think--
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:11.680]   Well, a lot of the facts are not as black and white as that.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.960]   They're interpretations of data or of happenings
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.840]   or of perspectives.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.720]   So when you start dealing with politics, it becomes--
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.480]   or rules, it's very easy to say, well, this law
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.840]   will make this happen.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.960]   And it's possible the law could make that happen.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:37.240]   It's also-- and it's a willful ignoring of trade-offs
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.000]   in a lot of-- especially in the political field,
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.640]   it is a-- this law will kill babies.
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:49.040]   It might kill one baby, but it might also
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:52.200]   enable a million more toddlers to live.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.640]   And so-- this is a terrible example,
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.920]   but it's the kind of thing that happens a lot.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:00.440]   So the law-- both statements can be true.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:05.960]   And that's often where our facts have been conflicting.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.880]   Now we're basically to--
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.320]   I'm wearing a red shirt.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.320]   No, it's blue, and clearly it's blue.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.280]   This is killing--
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.360]   Your red is my blue.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.400]   This is killing me.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.400]   I mean, I guess I just oversimplify much of everything
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.320]   in life, and I guess it's probably why I just stay
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.720]   in my corner and keep quiet.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.480]   No, no, no.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.760]   That's Karsten's corner.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:29.840]   You don't have a corner.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.160]   Karsten has a corner.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.160]   No, you're right.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.000]   I don't have a corner.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:33.960]   I have a corner.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.720]   We can all have corners.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.800]   It's OK.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.200]   We all have corners.
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.720]   No, we have to have a corner.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:42.720]   We'll play.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:43.640]   Basically.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.400]   Yes.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.320]   The spike creating--
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.080]   We're all going to be quarantined in our corners.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:49.600]   Corner T.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.520]   Of course, you've got to bring that to the virus.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.240]   We chose six feet apart.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.040]   How about we do some change law?
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.520]   Let's do it.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.840]   It's change log time.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   Google change log.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:09.080]   All right.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.800]   Apparently, I already talked about the first thing,
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.400]   the change log.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.120]   Sorry about that.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.680]   Second thing, although you're first,
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:19.120]   is a new Google search feature that is one of those things
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.680]   that's likely imminent because this ended up
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.560]   online in some support pages.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:27.000]   And then shortly after it was published,
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:27.960]   it's no longer there.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.560]   So this is probably around the corner.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:32.080]   But public profile cards.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.520]   And this would replace what used to be,
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.000]   if you remember with Google+, may rest in peace.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.680]   We had these public facing profile pages through Google
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.080]   that would have whatever information we wanted on there,
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.040]   our email address or phone number, if you wanted,
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.960]   a little bio, that sort of stuff.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.120]   So it's kind of from what we gather
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.320]   from these support pages and some of the screenshots
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:55.600]   that we saw on--
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.160]   let's see here.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.200]   It was an Android police article similar to that.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.320]   Something that we could curate put up.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.160]   It's not going to replace search results.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.120]   It's not the sidebar thing that comes up when you do a Google
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:07.880]   search for someone.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.000]   And then it shows the little sidebar extra information
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.040]   sort of thing.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.200]   It's like its own kind of page with information.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.080]   That's the old Google+ looking profile.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.560]   So that's kind of what we used to see if I'm not mistaken.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.400]   It's not that bottom right-hand corner thing, as Rita points
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.320]   out on her article.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.240]   But if you keep scrolling down just a little bit further,
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.520]   you'll see kind of a--
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.920]   it's mobile only right now, or at least it
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.920]   was when they discovered these support pages.
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.400]   So that could be coming sometime in the near future.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.680]   Usually when we see these things leak like this,
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:44.400]   it doesn't take too much longer.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.760]   And you're never going to guess what I'm going to scream about now.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.200]   What?
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:54.680]   So if you're in-- what do you call it?
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.680]   What do you call it?
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.600]   My identity is going to mess up on Google.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:59.800]   Oh, sweets.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:00.300]   Sweet.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:00.800]   Sweet.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.800]   G Suite.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:04.320]   If you're in G Suite, guess what?
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.480]   I doesn't work with it.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.040]   The user-- no, it's worse.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:11.760]   The user-- so in companies, wherever users can't change
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.760]   their own profile, they have to get their administrator.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.600]   Oh, it's a bad name.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.800]   Oh, that's fun.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.560]   Isn't that ridiculous?
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.400]   Wait, but I'm--
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.680]   No, but that's the sweet.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.080]   So it's fine.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:27.560]   That's Google-- everything about Google sweets is the worst.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.960]   Meanwhile, it's the thing you pay for, right?
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:30.480]   Right.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.480]   It's the thing you pay for, and it's the worst.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.400]   I'm like, Google, I spend money on this.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.080]   Why won't you let it work with my desk, or my Google device?
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:37.800]   It's so weird.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.960]   And this is not a new issue.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.440]   It's been this way for years.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:42.200]   And they know--
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.160]   And it's not a cold on this way.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.400]   Show.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.160]   Yes.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.200]   OK.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.200]   They know--
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.800]   I think they actually fixed it in the side.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.040]   They just keep it this way to drive me nuts.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.360]   Yeah, it's all about pissing you off, Jeff.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.400]   Yes.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.240]   That's what-- see, Ant lives in a nice world
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.200]   where things are simple.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.280]   But my world--
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.200]   My world, everybody's messing with me.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.200]   It's all about Jeff's face.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:09.720]   Take that.
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.720]   Yes.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:13.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.160]   That's where we get great Jeff opportunities from him
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.000]   every week.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   Absolutely.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.120]   Absolutely.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.880]   If you happen to have the Firefox Edge and Opera browsers,
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.360]   or Opera browsers and use any of those over Chrome,
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.120]   congratulations.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:30.400]   You finally get to use Google Earth on them.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.120]   Apparently, there's been a six-month public beta of this
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.360]   happening.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.120]   The Google Earth kind of relaunch happened in 2017.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.800]   And since the relaunch, it's only worked in Chrome.
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:43.000]   So it's been a long time coming.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.840]   But now, these other browsers can get in on the Google Earth
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.640]   and find out about it.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.440]   Well, it's amazing.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.160]   As is that transition.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160]   Google Photos is shifting search around.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.840]   So there's going to be a new update that's a server side
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:01.600]   switch that's happening right now in the Google Photos app.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.720]   Used to be, or still is, if you still
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:07.000]   have the old version of the search up at the very top.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.080]   Now that's going to move down into a tab in the bottom row,
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.840]   along with the other things down there.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.240]   So you're going to have to go to kind of like a separate page
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.800]   for search.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.240]   But there, you're going to have a number of suggestions
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.760]   for people, pets, places, things you might want to search for.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:24.000]   So there's a little bit of UI built around that.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.240]   I think that makes sense.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.640]   A little bit easier.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.640]   It's one more tab that you might have to do.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.240]   But I guess we'll play around with it and see if--
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.920]   I think it makes sense because it helps your search results
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.240]   be a little bit faster.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.160]   Because I use this quite a bit when
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.640]   it comes to looking for photos.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.160]   And I'll put it in--
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.240]   say Clemson.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.560]   And of course, it would just pull up everything in Clemson
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.560]   when I actually meant just the Clemson football game.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.920]   Give me categories that says university sport
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.720]   event, something like that.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.040]   I think that's a nice little feature.
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:59.360]   Well, I wonder how dynamic those categories might be,
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.600]   or if they're going to have them specifically set for, no.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.280]   We've only got these four categories,
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.200]   and everything falls into them.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:05.640]   Who knows?
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.480]   But yeah, we'll find out.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.480]   Apparently, this one took me a little while
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:11.560]   to understand here.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:15.280]   Google posted some GIF tools, or if the G in Google
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.440]   is GIF and GIF.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.880]   So either way.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:18.400]   Thank you.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:20.920]   It's GIF.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.280]   Based on data from Google's GIF and stickers search
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.160]   engine 10r, which they acquired in 2018.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.760]   So the tools are actually embedded in a medium post.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.040]   And actually, I don't know if the tool on this Verge article
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.240]   is actually interactive.
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:40.080]   But the idea being you would tap into that area where shrug is,
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.440]   oh, yeah, it is.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.720]   And basically, they've done all this.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.880]   Show me creepy, please.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.880]   Show me creepy celebrities.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.400]   I want to see creepy celebrities.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.120]   So we select creepy.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.360]   White Shrute is creepy.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.320]   White Shrute's awesome.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.280]   Oh, yeah, but he's definitely creepy.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.200]   But he's definitely creepy.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:57.840]   And so they've got--
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.800]   So creepy do is not really creepy in the way
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.760]   that they're looking at it.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.360]   Not the same, yeah.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.440]   Fat Mickey Mouse is definitely creepy.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.360]   And then can you copy it?
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.200]   That's haunting me.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.400]   Put it away.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.840]   Copy link to GIF, OK.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:13.000]   To GIF, sorry.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.480]   Anyways, they've got a couple of tools.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.880]   If you go to the medium article,
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.160]   they've got like three or four different tools there
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.160]   that are interesting player.
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.320]   Why are they posting this on Medium and not on their blogs?
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:23.720]   Why do they make it so hard to find it for me?
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.360]   That's what confused me about this.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.280]   They're like, OK, here's a bunch of interesting GIF tools.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.080]   Where's that?
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:32.680]   We're going to make it really hard for you to use them.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:33.760]   Oh, why?
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:34.280]   Why?
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.640]   That will haunt my nightmares.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:36.680]   Nice work, Mr. Kid.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.240]   Nice, very nice.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.640]   It's going to be writing like--
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:43.120]   Trapped and locked in your hole.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.040]   You're going to see that Mickey Mouse.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.120]   Weird Mickey Mouse.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.680]   Your feverish dream.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.160]   Ungelating on the curb.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.160]   Sharing it with my children right now.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.360]   No!
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.600]   As-- yes.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.080]   Dan-- not surprised.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.960]   New assistant features rolling out today,
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:04.720]   if you say, hey, gee, read it or hey, gee, read this page.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.240]   When you're on a web page, assistant
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.560]   will read the web page to you.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.920]   It can also translate 42 languages
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.080]   into your preferred language.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.080]   Pretty neat feature.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.760]   First introduced in preview at CES in January before you guessed it.
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.840]   The coronavirus went on a canceling spree.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.680]   Drink.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.600]   Drink.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.160]   Get it in every story today.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:32.080]   So yeah, assistant will read you a web page.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.480]   And that is the Google change law.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:34.980]   Cuh.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.120]   Did it?
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.720]   Dig it.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.360]   Any final bits and pieces before we move into the picks?
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.240]   Did we do this?
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:47.800]   Hold on.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:51.240]   And anything that stand out to you.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:55.160]   There's a verge survey of attitudes toward tech companies.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:55.920]   OK.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.360]   That's right.
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:57.760]   And someone on Twitter-- I discovered it,
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:00.040]   because someone on Twitter said that the-- that's
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.440]   all you need is someone on Twitter.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.840]   That's my authority.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.160]   That the tech lash is a myth.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:07.600]   It's a myth.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.880]   Because if you look at what are your opinions about these brands,
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:13.400]   true Facebook and Twitter at the bottom,
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.760]   but a hell of a lot of brands on top of that list
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.640]   are very well-liked.
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:24.040]   Amazon 91%, Google 90%, YouTube 90%, Netflix 89%, and so on.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.640]   Then how do these brands impact society?
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.440]   Neutral and positive, very little on the purely negative side,
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.440]   except Twitter and Facebook, again.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.640]   Share of people who trust these companies
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.560]   with their information.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:45.000]   Microsoft 75%, Amazon 73%, Netflix 71%, Google 69%.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:51.000]   Then I thought it was a little--
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.160]   Oh, go on.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.040]   One more, one more.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.280]   I thought it was a little-- it was telling in terms
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:59.960]   of how the surveys are done as all surveys bring prejudices.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:03.280]   Question is, what are your top reasons for not using Facebook?
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.520]   I wish they'd also asked, what are your top reasons
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:08.240]   for using Facebook since 2 billion people still do?
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:08.840]   Right.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.840]   Right.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:13.360]   So anyway, I thought it was-- but the point here
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.080]   was just that I was drawn to it because it's not as bad as one
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.120]   would hear in media.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:18.720]   That's the point.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.320]   Sorry, Stacy, go ahead.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.200]   No, no, I was just going to say it's a little bit interesting
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.560]   because Instagram owned by Facebook
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.560]   may be interesting to see stuff like Ring, which
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.160]   is owned by Amazon.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.920]   Like some of the brands-- the brands taking a drubbing are
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:37.480]   brands, but they're still owned by some of these companies,
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.640]   which is always-- like they had YouTube and Google
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.960]   is separate entities there, which--
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.880]   Instagram is down at the low end next to Facebook and Twitter
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.320]   on what are your opinions of these brands?
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.440]   It is, yes.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.360]   Well, the 72% see our favorable about Instagram,
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:56.080]   28% not favorable, versus Amazon 91% favorable,
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.120]   9% unfavorable.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.040]   So it's worse by a major chunk, but it's not disastrous.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:08.880]   Even Facebook, 71% have favorable opinions on Facebook.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:09.760]   It's weird that people are more--
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.880]   Twitter is really--
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:11.840]   That's really weird.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.360]   I think that's again media lately is people
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.040]   are blaming Twitter for all the nasty things they hear
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.560]   repeated in media.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.080]   Right.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.920]   So anyway, that story struck me as interesting.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.480]   Or it shows just how fleeting our rage can be.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.440]   And it feels like rage is very fleeting nowadays.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.560]   It's fleeting.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.040]   Was that-- you said fleeting.
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:38.640]   Oh, that's right.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.560]   Oh, man.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.040]   There's winter.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.080]   Drink, sleep, Twitter.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.080]   But you know what I mean?
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.880]   People get really enraged about something,
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:48.080]   and it doesn't seem to take very long for that rage
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:48.680]   to die off.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.480]   And no, there's that--
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.520]   That's the thing that I may be--
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:51.520]   That's the thing that I may be about now.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:52.520]   Right.
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.520]   Move on to something else.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.520]   So maybe that's part of it too.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.520]   All right.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.120]   I had an update from the story last week.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:43:59.640]   What's up?
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:03.800]   Or we talked about the weather person that had the filters pop
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.120]   up on their news weather broadcast about the snow storm.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.320]   You remember that, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:11.840]   Right.
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.320]   So to recount for those who were here--
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.520]   In Carolina's, there was a snow storm.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.080]   I put it in the air quotes.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.080]   Snow storm.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.080]   Wow, 10 flakes.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.560]   Let's do team coverage kind of snow storm, right?
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:25.560]   Right.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.200]   So the local weather person, he was out doing his coverage for it,
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.800]   and he was using Facebook Live, but accidentally turned on
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.640]   the filters in Facebook Live.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:37.080]   So his face had all of the little googly eyes and a little
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.680]   hats and things like that.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.520]   Yeah, that's the one.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.600]   And I mentioned last week, I was like, Elmo West sounds like home,
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.440]   and it was.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.080]   So I told him, I was like, I'm going to go to the house.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:49.760]   And it was.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.560]   So I talked to my mother about it because that's part of the
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.320]   company that she works with.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.080]   And she says, yeah, he was out.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.600]   And he was apologetic about it, but it's one of those things
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   where the news team, they're pretty much like a one man or
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.240]   one person team.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:05.680]   OK.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:06.840]   Going out to do these things.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.000]   So he set up his camera, accidentally hit the filters.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.800]   He didn't know because he's just supposed to go out there
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.320]   in the field and just put it on a tripod walking.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320]   Well, yeah, the display is showing the other way because
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.240]   he got the best camera shining on you.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.200]   Oh, that's great.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.400]   So it's so great.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.280]   He didn't know.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.640]   But he had fun with it and had a little follow-up about it.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.720]   He said, sorry, my bad.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.200]   But we'll get over.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.080]   Let's just have some fun with it and move on.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.040]   But yeah.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:37.280]   Yeah, I mean, at least he wasn't doing a murder trial or
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.080]   anything like--
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.120]   Yes, right.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.120]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:42.960]   I see it's true.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:45.680]   I mean, there are times when you would not want that
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.120]   happening.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.520]   But it's no storm.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.120]   Well, we loosely say--
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.120]   Well, I don't understand.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:53.040]   It's no storm.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.800]   Why does it cycle through?
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:56.280]   I don't know.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:01.240]   Because usually, anytime I ever use these features, it stays
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:01.680]   on one.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:02.440]   It stays on one.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:02.960]   I guess because they don't--
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:04.960]   I still love it.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:06.080]   I don't know.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.080]   No idea.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:08.480]   That is interesting.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.040]   That's so fantastic, though.
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.680]   They should all do that, really.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:14.120]   Well, except for if you have certain scenarios.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.480]   Probably a bad idea.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.960]   Very good point.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.200]   During all happy talk on local news, they should do that.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:20.680]   There we go.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.760]   Or just the silly--
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:23.640]   yeah, I mean, because like, what?
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:26.800]   50% of local news is like scare tactics and silliness.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:27.880]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:28.400]   Absolutely.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.400]   We're boring city council meetings.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:31.400]   Yes.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.160]   All right, let's do the picks.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:38.200]   We have arrived to the picks.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.560]   So, Jeff, let's start with you.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:42.400]   Oh, OK.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480]   No.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:48.200]   So there was some Amazon things.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.800]   So we can do coronavirus.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:54.000]   Amazon has removed 1 million products for price gouging
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000]   in line.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.560]   But as I was looking around through that,
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.320]   then I found something I enjoyed a lot more.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.600]   And this is not new.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:04.080]   But a TV station, a CBS station in upstate New York
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:08.880]   to the story about how products are liquidated
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.000]   when you return them.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000]   If it comes within the original packaging,
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:12.840]   they just resell it.
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.240]   But anything that's been opened
[01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:15.560]   goes to a liquidator.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.280]   And then the liquidator just tried to remarket it.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:19.040]   And then there's all kinds of stuff.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.480]   So if you go to--
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.880]   I have the link in there--
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.080]   direct liquidation.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.360]   It's not individual.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.600]   You can buy some things individually.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.720]   But a lot of it is just bulk.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.320]   So a pallet filled with decorations
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.760]   and favor, stationary invitations, disposable tableware,
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.360]   MSRP of $2,200.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.680]   Right now, you could bid on it at $114.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:50.600]   A pallet with 70 pieces of stuffed animals, $2,500 MSRP.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:55.640]   You can get it bid now for $224.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.280]   Just all kinds of weird stuff.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:00.840]   And I can't figure out who would necessarily buy a truck
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.520]   load of 26 pallets.
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.280]   I know exactly.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.080]   400 to 900 PCs.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.680]   General merchandise.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:13.680]   $70,000 MSRP by now for $7,000.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:15.800]   So you get 90% off this stuff.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.160]   Right.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:18.640]   And people end up reselling all this stuff.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:21.160]   They channel through it.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:22.800]   Yeah, pawn shops, eBay.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.880]   I mean, so much of what you see, Amazon third party sellers,
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.960]   like refurbished items, eBay.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.320]   I mean, they're people that this is their job.
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.480]   And they get passed off as new.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:36.120]   They get passed off as new or they posted as refurbished.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:38.320]   And they understand when they buy these
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:43.400]   that not every single thing in the lot, it is kind of a gamble.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:46.080]   Not everything in the lot is going to have some sort of value
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.040]   that they can resell.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.280]   But they end up selling a lot of it.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.760]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.640]   I've seen on certain YouTube channels
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.800]   where you could get these little pallets full of photography
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.280]   gear, you know, and little tripods and things like that
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.680]   for next to nothing.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:06.280]   As long as you buy a whole pallet, you'll spend $1,000
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.400]   on it or something like that.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.000]   But what's in there is way worth more than $1,000
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.600]   because of so much it's in there.
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.800]   Yeah, there's another one where I was looking-- oh, shoot.
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:16.760]   I messed that up.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.440]   The other one is liquidation.com, I think it's called.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:28.360]   And so, you could imagine, you could buy like 100 iPhones.
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.200]   And for a fraction of the price and make
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:33.800]   all of iPhones or something, right?
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.120]   Totally.
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:35.360]   You sell it for parts, you know?
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:39.600]   People looking for a certain part for their broken iPhone.
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.200]   Isn't that the storage wars?
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.440]   Isn't that that company?
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.480]   Or that really reality--
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:45.360]   Oh, is that what it is?
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.360]   Storage or something where you buy a shed?
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:51.960]   Yeah, well, you buy the contents of what is-- it's similar.
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:52.880]   It's that concept.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.800]   You buy the unseen--
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:58.520]   your bed, it's kind of like gambling, but it's not.
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:49:59.720]   Yeah, they make a whole show up.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:00.520]   Exactly.
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:03.320]   You buy the storage and you don't know what's on the inside
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.360]   until you are confirmed to be the winning bidder,
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.720]   and then you go in there and you see if you have anything
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.360]   valuable to get rid of.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:09.920]   What is in here?
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.000]   I found a mowed couch.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.880]   Just a couch, really?
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:16.520]   It's better than a dead body.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.240]   I'll put it that way.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.200]   That's the tagline.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.040]   Show title.
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:22.680]   It's better than a dead body.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.240]   Let's see here.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.800]   Get a rough Seattle already.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.960]   Stay see what you got.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:34.440]   OK, you guys, I'm going to let y'all know
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:38.080]   that I am under embargo for exciting, better things
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:38.840]   about this.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.800]   But keep this in mind for tomorrow morning.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:45.120]   Oh, I'm going to have to-- should I unplug it?
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.640]   Come to me.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.160]   OK.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.360]   Oh, can you see it?
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:50.860]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:52.000]   I've got to make things up.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.640]   This is my helium router, y'all.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:51:00.880]   This is a $350 router that has a blockchain-based
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:07.080]   token system that is providing long distance--
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.160]   not Wi-Fi coverage--
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.560]   long distance coverage for things on helium.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:15.280]   They have what's called the LongFi network.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.160]   Tomorrow, there's going to be exciting news regarding helium
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.200]   and its network capabilities.
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.360]   But it is a really fun--
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.880]   is not really the right word.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:27.840]   It is a--
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.080]   I mean, it's fun for me, but that's not--
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:33.520]   that's a terrible standard.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.560]   You basically set this router up,
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:39.640]   and you provide coverage to devices on the network,
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:42.760]   and then you get paid for both providing coverage,
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:43.560]   and then also--
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:48.480]   oh, what's the word-- providing coverage,
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.360]   and then also being part of a blockchain that
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.360]   creates a consensus around other devices on the network.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.760]   So did that make any sense?
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:57.880]   Oh, no.
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:58.960]   No, it did.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.280]   Because I'm not your fault, my fault.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:02.520]   Make it the number.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:07.040]   OK, this is a device that allows other devices that
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.920]   use the same radio to talk to it.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.880]   So if I have a sensor that uses the LongFi radio network,
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:20.160]   and after tomorrow, it will be a lot more interesting,
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:23.960]   then my router provides coverage for it,
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:27.280]   and then I get paid for providing that coverage,
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.240]   and by paid, I'm paid in cryptographic tokens.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:33.800]   Yes.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:34.320]   OK.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.120]   And who's paying you?
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:36.280]   Why?
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.920]   Get paid in helium.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:39.920]   I get paid in helium.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:40.440]   Something.
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.640]   But what's their interest in paying you?
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:43.240]   What are they--
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.360]   They want to create aid--
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:48.480]   because the more people have this, the more coverage there is.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.920]   It's basically-- remember phone?
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:51.680]   It's like phone.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:52.200]   It's phone.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.400]   Yeah, it's exactly like phone.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:54.640]   It's the IoT phone.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.680]   It is the IoT phone.
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:57.480]   It is the most--
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.160]   Now dumb, dumb, you can't say, OK, thank you.
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:52:59.720]   OK, I got it.
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:00.560]   No problem.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:01.400]   And I'm sorry.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:04.480]   I'm like so losing everything right now.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.520]   But I'm the only one on Babe Bridge Island,
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:09.480]   but I'm not the only one in my area.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.240]   There are--
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.640]   No, no, in Seattle, there are several.
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:17.720]   There are 3,122 hot spots around the world.
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.440]   See?
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:22.400]   Here's my little tab telling you, oh, don't look at that.
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:23.240]   Wait.
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:24.200]   OK, yes, you can.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.640]   I'm like, I'm making sure I'm not showing anything special.
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:30.920]   So yeah, belatedly.
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.680]   Nice.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.880]   So this is a very fun thing for someone
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.480]   who likes the blockchain--
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:41.840]   and-- oh, I'm sorry-- who wants to provide coverage for something.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:48.320]   And then I also am playing with another blockchain-based low
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.760]   power wide area network.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.400]   This one from an app called Notal.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:56.840]   And I downloaded it, it's called Notal Cache, N-O-D-L.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:06.560]   And I currently have 0.000427 Notal caches.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.920]   You're racking up the notal.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:08.920]   And I'm--
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.280]   You're going to retire.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:15.400]   I'm basically providing Bluetooth connectivity
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.280]   to things that are around.
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.160]   So that's what that network is.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.160]   So basically, I'm running a bunch of different little secret
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.920]   networks that I'm apparently getting paid
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:27.640]   in minuscule amounts of cryptocurrency.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:28.080]   And then--
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.040]   But I'm doing it because I'm a good citizen.
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:30.560]   And I--
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:31.560]   You're giving it back.
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:32.560]   You're giving it back.
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.080]   And the geek.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.080]   And because it's my job.
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:35.880]   Yes.
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:36.720]   Indeed.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:38.720]   I need more about that.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.320]   Some cities--
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.760]   They're-- they're--
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:43.920]   this is not an investment opportunity.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.920]   Let me just put that right up.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.200]   Oh, I wasn't.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:47.200]   OK.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.800]   This is not going to send your boys to college.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.360]   I don't think.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:53.520]   This is-- but it is kind of neat.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:55.080]   So I'm having fun.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.440]   More news to follow tomorrow.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.400]   And yes, tomorrow the helium thing's
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:00.600]   going to get way more exciting.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:01.080]   Interesting.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.920]   Wow.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:03.440]   Right on.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.880]   Helium router.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:07.240]   What you got, Ant?
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:12.200]   Well, I have record bots loft as my first pick.
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.880]   This is a company up in--
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:17.240]   I believe it's in Michigan.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.920]   I think it was in near Wakefield, Michigan.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.880]   But what they did is they offered an opportunity
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.680]   for local photographers or people that are actually just
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:28.560]   trying to get started in photography.
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:32.120]   A spot to go and practice wedding photos.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.960]   So they set up a date and they bring in some models.
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:39.120]   And they let people sit down and just go through what
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:41.240]   it's like to shoot for and engagement, what
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:44.960]   it's like to shoot for weddings and things of that nature.
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:47.240]   And they give you all this beautiful lighting.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.800]   It's a really nice setup.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:51.320]   And it's just another way to sort of help
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:53.120]   grow the photography community.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.320]   Personally, I'm not doing it because I
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:57.680]   don't have to catch the shooter wedding.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.640]   I don't want that pressure.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.960]   But I thought this was a great idea.
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:07.720]   And this was shared to me because one of our loyal listeners,
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:10.640]   Mr. Jason Miller, he's a loyal listener of hands-on
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:13.200]   photography, he shared some of his photos.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.680]   And I was like, wow, where is this done?
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:17.600]   He said, yeah, this local company just hooked us up
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:20.640]   with a spot to go shoot and do some trial shots.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.880]   And we should see.
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:25.120]   Yeah, there's this link showing off the images that he shot.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:27.640]   Because he's trying to get started in photography
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:29.640]   and just get better at it.
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:31.600]   So he's been listening to our show.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:34.280]   And just taking the time to get out there and practice his
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:34.800]   skills.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:37.640]   And it's nice to see that a company like record bots
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:41.160]   loft there in Michigan, giving these folks an opportunity
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.240]   to just go out there with no pressure, no strings attached.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:47.200]   And it's a safe place, no judgment.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.480]   Get out there, go shoot, get better.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.440]   Nice.
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:52.520]   That's a good shot.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:53.920]   Very nice.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.480]   And that is Instagram.com/recordbox loft.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:02.000]   See what that's all about.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.760]   I came across an article earlier today that talked about how
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:13.320]   you could use a rooted Android phone to jailbreak an iPhone.
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.800]   I was like, oh, really?
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.200]   You could do that now?
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:17.400]   I'm going to be at it.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:19.360]   Yeah, so I actually want to try this.
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:21.400]   Just out of sheer curiosity.
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:22.280]   I would love to do this.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:23.960]   It's like an episode for hands on Android.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:27.880]   But there is a walk through.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.120]   XDA referred to it.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:30.680]   It was initially posted in Reddit.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:36.160]   And then XDA featured it and gave some extra information
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:37.080]   as far as how to do it.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.080]   It's not that difficult.
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.960]   Like if you already have a rooted Android phone,
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:42.920]   it's actually really simple for the most part.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:46.240]   It just involves getting the right cable to plug from the iPhone
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:50.400]   into the rooted Android phone and then running
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:56.080]   a couple of busy box, a couple of terminal commands.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.600]   And boom, you've got a rooted iPhone.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.080]   It's all because of Check Rain gaining Linux support.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.640]   And as such, Android support, Check Rain
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.480]   is compatible with iOS 13.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.600]   That's iPhone 5 through 10.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:14.640]   Or it's compatible up to iOS 13, and including iOS 13,
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:16.040]   if I'm not mistaken.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.800]   It is a temporary jailbreak, though.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.960]   It doesn't survive a reboot.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:20.920]   So that's--
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:22.480]   Not yet, anyway.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.000]   But relatively easy to do.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.880]   And so I just think it looks like a good challenge.
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:29.560]   Yes.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.240]   Understand if you're doing this.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:34.520]   Understand the potential downsides,
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:36.400]   the fact that you're breaking the security layer
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:39.080]   on your Android phone in order to root it.
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:41.120]   And the fact that you'd be breaking the security layer
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.080]   on your iPhone in order to jailbreak it.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:47.560]   So understand that and know that the risks involved
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.240]   in doing that.
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:51.280]   But kind of a neat little deaky walkthrough
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:52.960]   that I think I might have to do.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.480]   I look forward to seeing it.
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.080]   So his face just lit up with his sawed-head article.
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:00.160]   It's been a while since I've done this sort of thing.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:02.520]   I've been lit up because the germs that he touched his face
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.320]   with are glowing.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:06.400]   Steve Gibson--
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:10.280]   Steve Gibson over at Security Now has some more information
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:14.440]   on Check Rain and how to jailbreak your iPhone.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.480]   If you want to check out--
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:20.080]   Yeah, he's had a couple of focuses, focused episodes
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:21.920]   on Check Rain and what it's all about.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.040]   And all of Check Rain is a temporary jailbreak, right?
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.040]   Like--
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.080]   If I remember correctly?
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:29.400]   Yeah, it doesn't survive a reboot,
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:33.600]   but it's just fun to play with your iPhone.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:36.800]   And so if you can just do it with the Android phone
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.160]   that you have in your pocket at any time
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.440]   and swap right over to jailbroken iPhone--
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:41.440]   It's pretty sweet.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:42.720]   Hey, this is kind of neat.
[01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:43.720]   Neat that you can.
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:44.600]   I love that you can.
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:46.720]   And it's been a while since I've done anything like that.
[01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:50.080]   So I see it as a challenge.
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:51.600]   So maybe I'll do that sometime soon.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:54.120]   And you can find that at my new show,
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:57.560]   twit.tv/h0a, hands-on Android.
[01:59:57.560 --> 01:59:58.440]   That's it.
[01:59:58.440 --> 01:59:59.000]   We've reached the--
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.080]   You have a new show?
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:00.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:01.080]   I love it.
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:02.480]   That's why you weren't here to hear the big--
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.000]   Good one.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:03.480]   Yes.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.480]   Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:05.160]   OK.
[02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:06.840]   Oh, I'm excited.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:08.080]   I use Android.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.840]   Well, there you go.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:13.560]   So it's tips, tricks, walkthroughs, deep dives.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:18.040]   Last week, I did a kind of like a deep look at the Android 11
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:20.840]   developer preview one.
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:21.960]   There we go.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:25.320]   That came out like a couple of weeks ago.
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:27.480]   So walks through that.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.960]   This week I'm doing kind of a focus on permissions.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.320]   And yeah, I don't know.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.480]   I'm so excited.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:33.200]   Yeah, that's cool.
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.000]   Sending you really esoteric, weird questions.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:36.640]   Oh, I love that.
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.240]   Stacey.
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:38.280]   Yes.
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:40.000]   That is a feature that everyone knows about.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.120]   And I'll be like, really?
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:45.360]   I mean, I see the show as a way to kind of dive
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:48.760]   into things that more experienced Android users can
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:52.760]   benefit from, but also as a way to kind of like explain some--
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:56.560]   no, but also as a way to explain things that are maybe
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:59.200]   a little bit less deep in the OS.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.560]   You know, like a lot of people might not know or understand.
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:03.520]   They know they hear about permissions all the time,
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:05.840]   but they might not understand what is kind of the reasoning
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.760]   behind it and why you want to be careful when you're
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.240]   switching your permissions, that sort of stuff.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:12.600]   So that's my goal with that show.
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:13.600]   So yeah.
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:15.120]   That's absolutely going to watch it.
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.040]   Thank you.
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:18.240]   I appreciate that.
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:20.840]   But yeah, Twitter.tv/HOA for that.
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.280]   I usually promote myself last.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:23.960]   And this time I promoted myself first.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:24.800]   I'm so sorry.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:25.800]   Selfish.
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:26.800]   Selfish.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:27.800]   Selfish.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:28.800]   So no, that was really helpful.
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:29.800]   All right, good.
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.160]   If only one person, it helped me.
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:34.960]   Stacy, what you want to talk about?
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:37.320]   Stacy.ioT.com, you're working on anything
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:38.800]   that you want people to know about?
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:40.640]   Oh, well, I said people to Kevin's stuff.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.440]   So that's the most useful thing I think we've got right now.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:44.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:45.920]   Always useful.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:48.960]   Listen to the podcast, the Internet of Things podcast,
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.680]   and sign up for my newsletter.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.640]   If you are interested in the Internet of Things,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:57.000]   it is free and chock full of delightful information.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:57.500]   Right.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:58.840]   And that's-- yeah.
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.280]   And that's about it.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:03.040]   And yeah, definitely check that out.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:07.280]   Also check out Jeff Jarvis Buzz Machine.com.
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:08.640]   Anything you want to leave people with,
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:10.440]   other than wash your hands, don't touch your face,
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.280]   all the usual--
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:15.800]   the usual salutations in this coronavirus era.
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.120]   Pick your nose.
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:18.200]   Pick your nose.
[02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:18.700]   All right.
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:19.960]   I'll stick your nose.
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:22.520]   Even with their hamster kelp.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.120]   Oh, that's right.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.360]   We forgot about that hamster.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:28.200]   OK, what was that real quick?
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.360]   It was already on the rundown, but now it's
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:32.360]   become my German word of the week.
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:33.600]   Thank you, Carson.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:35.200]   Here, Carson.
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:40.440]   It comes from the word of the verb to hamster, or gahamster,
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.800]   which means to hoard or panic by.
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:44.160]   Kelph means to buy.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:46.640]   Hamster means to stick it in your cheeks.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:51.920]   So a hamster kelpster is a hamster by is hoarding,
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:54.760]   which is what people are doing, even with, as Stacy said,
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:55.920]   toilet paper.
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:56.200]   Yes.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:59.200]   Yeah, they'll do that.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.960]   So I just saw the New York Times just sent out
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:06.400]   its coronavirus email update.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.080]   So I'll leave you with this little bit of factoids and numbers.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.600]   A one-coronavirus guy, the man around 50 in West
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.880]  chester County in New Rochelle was found to be ill with coronavirus.
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:18.520]   He's in the hospital.
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.360]   Now he's doing well.
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:22.600]   However, now nine people have been found so far
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.320]   to be infected, the man's wife and two children,
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.640]   a friend who drove him to the hospital,
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:29.600]   a friend who was in close proximity with a man,
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.360]   and the friend's wife and three of their children.
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:38.040]   So now 1,000 people in the area have been told to self-quarantine,
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:40.320]   including nurses and doctors of the hospital.
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.720]   The man's daughter's high school and his son's college
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:44.680]   have canceled classes.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.280]   So did New York Law School after a student there reporting
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:51.200]   to have contact with a man who works at Manhattan law firm.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.960]   That's one case.
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:54.240]   One case.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:56.000]   One case.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.120]   Holy cow.
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.000]   And then when you're talking about--
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.480]   what are they saying that the mortality rate is based--
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.320]   3% is latest.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:05.320]   3%?
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:10.200]   Who just called it 3.4% is what they said today.
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:12.720]   Yeah, the regular flu is below 1%.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:16.040]   However, because we are not testing
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:17.720]   and don't know how many cases, how many people
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.160]   are really infected, my hope is that number will come down
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:24.960]   as the number of cases increases.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:27.160]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, actually.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:30.360]   But it is definitely-- more people now have died--
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.080]   I just saw this in the headline this morning.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:35.120]   More people have died this season of the coronavirus
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.520]   than of the plane virus.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.360]   So those people say, oh, it's nothing like we're panicking.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:40.920]   Oh, the flu?
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:41.960]   The real virus kills more people.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:42.600]   The flu, thank you.
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:44.000]   The flu.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.200]   That's not true.
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.640]   The coronavirus has killed 3,000 people.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:49.440]   The flu is so far this year.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.280]   This year, this year.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:51.760]   How many?
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:53.640]   Flu deaths in 2020?
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:54.400]   In 2020?
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.640]   Or this flu season?
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:56.400]   2020.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.280]   All right.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:58.480]   Let's see if that--
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:01.040]   Which I guess they both fall in 2020, so that makes sense.
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:06.560]   Sorry.
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:08.120]   Sorry, just like that does not--
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:10.000]   Stacey, you always find--
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.480]   No, because the flu on average kills people--
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:14.400]   80,000 people here.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.000]   So--
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.760]   18,000 to 46,000.
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:19.640]   Says the CDC.
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:21.680]   OK, but 80,000 people haven't died
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.560]   so far of the coronavirus.
[02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:24.840]   Right, that's true.
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:28.480]   Well, that's well, but that's for the whole period of the flu,
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:28.920]   the coronavirus.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:29.400]   I don't know.
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:30.400]   I don't know.
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:31.800]   I should have had the actual link.
[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:32.760]   I apologize.
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:34.480]   Erase what I just said.
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:35.320]   Sorry.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:36.880]   I was just like, hold up there, Joe.
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:37.680]   Erase what I said.
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:38.120]   I'll call in, yeah.
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:38.560]   No, you're right.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:39.560]   You're quite right to do that to me.
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:40.320]   You're quite right.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.360]   I--
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:45.600]   Although maybe at this point, from January to now,
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:47.840]   a certain number of flu deaths are less.
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.880]   I don't know.
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:49.720]   I don't know.
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:52.360]   OK, I'm on the CDC's flu website.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:53.480]   Key updates.
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:55.720]   I'm just trying to see.
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:57.080]   I just don't know where it is.
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:59.400]   I've been checking to watch the "New York Times"
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:00.960]   on this a lot, and so I thought,
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.440]   but yeah, I should have put the link in.
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:02.760]   You're right.
[02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:03.040]   You're right.
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:05.040]   You're right.
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:08.800]   Oh, here's a lovely chart.
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:09.440]   OK.
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:13.320]   pneumonia and influenza mortality from data for the week--
[02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:14.320]   for the whole week.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:15.800]   So--
[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:17.200]   oh, but it's percentages.
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:22.400]   So I have to get the chart data for the actual number of deaths.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:22.920]   OK.
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:24.320]   It's going to take a little time.
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:25.200]   Yeah, sorry.
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:27.120]   I'll stop now.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:28.440]   Jason will stick a washes face.
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:29.000]   Or can--
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:29.520]   Yes.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:32.120]   Yes, I'm so ready to wash my face and my hands
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.520]   and burn my clothes.
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:35.920]   And I think having been a proximity
[02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:37.600]   is going to go just in the shower.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:39.520]   Yeah, you're basically already infected.
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:40.720]   Yeah, whatever it is that it--
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:44.880]   I don't know if my allergies are.
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:47.400]   What do you want people to know about it?
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.920]   Continue to check out Hands-On Photography here
[02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:53.440]   on a network that's twit.tv/hop.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:55.720]   Having a lot of fun sharing a little bit
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:06:57.600]   that I know about photography.
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.880]   And giving different tips and tricks.
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:04.000]   And this week, we're going to dive more into the hardware
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.720]   and not so much into the software.
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:10.560]   But I also enjoy sharing the photos that are sent to me,
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:12.560]   whether it's in the Twit community
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:16.000]   or just sent to our email, hopit, twit.tv.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.360]   So yeah, check that out.
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.960]   Thursdays, every week.
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:20.080]   Subscribe.
[02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:25.640]   Subscribe, twit.tv/hop for Hands-On Photography.
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:27.320]   Jeff, you might be right.
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:29.280]   Oh.
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:30.160]   I'll take the mic.
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:30.960]   She's crunched in.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:34.520]   So the first-- the chart has the data
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:37.520]   for the first seven weeks of 2020.
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:41.360]   It's averaging about 380.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:46.480]   It looks like for those first seven weeks now, 2020.
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:51.360]   So what we're looking at is the flu.
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.360]   The flu.
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:53.200]   So you're looking at--
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:56.720]   but we're 10 weeks-- how many weeks are we in now?
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:57.840]   10 or 11 weeks in.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:59.800]   So it's a lagging indicator.
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:03.960]   And I don't know by the second week of February.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:08.360]   If we go by the cases at that same amount of time,
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.520]   I don't think that's an accurate stat.
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:14.480]   But based on flu tests, this is just in the United States.
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:17.320]   So in the United States, yeah.
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:18.760]   So OK, you're wrong.
[02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:19.320]   You're still wrong.
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:20.280]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:23.160]   So you-- but we know a little more about how you're--
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:25.320]   Carson, can you just edit all of that out?
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:26.840]   Take me out, please.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:28.520]   I was going to suggest--
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:30.080]   You were feeling really good there for a bit.
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:33.720]   Just making a clip of Stacy saying, Jeff, you might be right.
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:36.680]   But now I'm just going to make a clip of saying, no, Jeff,
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:37.840]   you're wrong.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:38.840]   You're still too high enough.
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:39.360]   You're not wrong.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.360]   You're not wrong.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.360]   You're not wrong.
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.360]   Stacy, is your event still on tomorrow?
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:45.120]   Oh, what?
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:46.880]   Is your event still on tomorrow?
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:47.360]   I don't know.
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:48.800]   They haven't sent it out.
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:50.800]   It shouldn't be based on this, which is sad,
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:51.840]   because I'm going to lose money.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:54.080]   But it's OK, because I don't want--
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:55.720]   You want to live.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:58.160]   Well, I'm probably going to live.
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:08:59.680]   I'm not in a high-risk area.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:01.480]   OK, good.
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:03.200]   But who knows?
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:04.360]   I shouldn't say that.
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:05.520]   Now I'm definitely going to die.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.600]   All right.
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:09.000]   Please don't.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.760]   Let's all live for a very, very long time.
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:13.560]   And I think go on with our lives now.
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:16.120]   And not touch our faces or eyeballs.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.680]   We'll see about that.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:18.180]   All right.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:20.960]   Hold my day laptop.
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:24.160]   Can somebody get Jason a how can you ask, please?
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:24.880]   Oh, please.
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:25.760]   I need to respite.
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:27.160]   I need everything at this point.
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:28.240]   Just get them a call.
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:30.600]   Twit.tv/twig, T-W-I-G.

[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:41.200]   every episode of the show, links

[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:47.320]   as well as to jump to the Twig channel on YouTube
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.640]   and subscribe there.

[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:55.920]   4 PM Eastern, 1 PM Pacific, 2,100 UTC.
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:00.680]   And you can go to twit.tv/live if you want to check out
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:02.880]   this show, which I don't know why you would want to check out
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:03.320]   this show.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:07.320]   There's never really anything to see when you're tuning in live.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:10.320]   I'm really trying to get this.
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.840]   Help it on.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:15.080]   Apparently, Burke has a smaller head than I do.
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:18.120]   Burke has a tiny, tiny head.
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.120]   Well, that's not going to work.
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.600]   This is not an effective solution, Burke.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.360]   This is an excellent video.
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:29.240]   I encourage everyone to go watch the video.
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:32.000]   And I should say, Burke is sacrificing himself for this.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:32.840]   Yes, he is.
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:34.200]   He just gave me his helmet.
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.360]   This is going to go on his face when he--
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.960]   He's going into the incinerator in about 10 years.
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:41.880]   He's going to sanitize it.
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:43.160]   All right, we've reached the end.
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:43.680]   That's it.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:44.240]   We're done.
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:45.120]   Don't touch your face.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:46.600]   We'll see you next week on this week.
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:48.000]   Go roll by everybody.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
