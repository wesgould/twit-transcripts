[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.760]   Dr. Jarvis, to his friends.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.360]   No doctor.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   No doctor.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.200]   Not even master.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.040]   DoC-K-T-E-R.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   Master Jarvis.

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.920]   Good to see you, Jeff.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.960]   At home, not in the soggy office.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.600]   Let's see, I was going to do an unboxing of my Pixel,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.360]   but I saw you did that with yours, so.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.000]   Well, you can unbox it later if you want.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.520]   Oh, it's already unboxing.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.880]   Have you used it?
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.400]   Not much.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.480]   It's open, but it's fast.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.440]   I'm reviewing it before you buy tomorrow.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.120]   In fact, I think I have some other things to show you.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.440]   We'll talk in a bit.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.720]   But let me tell you, having used it for almost a week now,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.440]   I love it.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.520]   Really?
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.160]   I am converted.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.760]   Wow.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   Save that.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.400]   Save that.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.960]   I'll save that.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.720]   Because we have a great guest here today.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.760]   Yes, to get to.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.840]   Very important.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.440]   So glad to welcome Matthew Ingram back.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   Matthew Ingram.com, of course.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.760]   Well, many time contributor to the show and all of our shows.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.640]   We love having them on.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.880]   And I had a referral receipt at the dissolution,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.920]   the dissolution of the desolation of Gig Aome.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.880]   But you're doing OK.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.680]   I'm doing OK.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.360]   Yep.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.880]   Still here.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.400]   Well, we just think the world of you,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.320]   we think actually the world of everybody at Gig Aome,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.440]   that was a terrible loss.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.000]   We talked about it.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.240]   It happened while we were doing the show, I think.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.920]   Wow.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.800]   I think so, didn't it?
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.120]   Anyway, great to have you, Matthew.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.280]   And just want to have your continued contribution.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.040]   You're not going back to the print.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.960]   No, I don't think so.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.840]   That's what everybody wrote about you,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   was how Matthew Ingram boldly made the decision
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.880]   to go from a print newspaper that Globe and Mail, right?
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.960]   Which is Toronto's greatest newspaper.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.480]   Actually, Canada's greatest newspaper,
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.960]   but the Toronto Metro, one of two.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   And Toronto has two papers.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   Three.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.000]   Three.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.960]   It's got three, yeah.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.400]   How'd that happen?
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.000]   Anyway.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.840]   Love Mail and Mail.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.000]   And the Globe and Mail loved reading it.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.640]   But you decided to go digital.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.680]   When did you do that?
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.680]   2010, January 2010.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.320]   Was there an internet then?
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.440]   There was.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.480]   And you say, "Giggo Home was your first gig?"
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.320]   So to speak.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.080]   Digital was.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.000]   I worked for the digital sort of unit of the newspaper
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.720]   for a few years and then made the jump to digital only.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.680]   But not back to not knowing anymore.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.880]   I'm sort of reviewing a number of options,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.200]   but I would not go back to just print.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.840]   Have you all stayed in touch with one another, Kevin?
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.480]   And yeah.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.240]   In fact, we still talk daily.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.800]   We use Slack.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.840]   That's neat.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.280]   We just started using that a few months ago.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.760]   And we sort of got used to just talking all the time.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.040]   So we're still doing it.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.600]   Everybody's trying to figure out what they're doing next.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.560]   And so it's kind of a support group at the moment.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.360]   I was also impressed.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.000]   I think it was Stacy, who as soon as the announcement happened,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   immediately was tweeting the great talent at Giga Hall.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.920]   And it's really impressive to see a boss look out for her chicks
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.400]   and look out for colleagues before whining about yourself.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.760]   It's Stacy Higginboth.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.920]   That was Laurel.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.840]   And I think Laurel--
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.520]   Yeah, because Stacy's one of the--
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.880]   That's right.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.440]   One of the chicks, yes.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.240]   Now it's the bad word to say.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.640]   I meant, I meant little words.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.560]   We were ducking with me.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.080]   One of the baby ducks.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.200]   One of the baby ducks is what he's saying.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.120]   No, we're a pretty tight group.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.480]   I'm glad to hear that, actually.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.120]   That bodes well, frankly.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.960]   In my experience.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.800]   You know, tech TV, the dissolution of tech TV.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.400]   Same thing.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.280]   We all were tight.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.080]   And we've all since helped each other and created our own ventures.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.360]   And so that worked out very well, I think.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.760]   Having a tech TV mafia, you don't have the Giga-owned mafia.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.440]   Yeah, the one-- it's one of the things I'm going to miss.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.400]   Obviously, the money is another thing.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.760]   But I'm definitely going to miss that group.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.240]   Right.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.720]   I think we all liked each other, respected each other,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.640]   and worked pretty well together, enjoyed it.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.080]   That's really honestly why Twitch started
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.480]   as I wanted to keep talking to my buddies.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.880]   Seriously, I missed the conversations we would have.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.800]   The motivation.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.960]   Anyway, let's talk about--
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.520]   I have actually not one, but two new Chromebooks.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.440]   And Jeff, time for me to eat crow.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   Whoa.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   From history book.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.280]   Well, you remember I was pretty dismissive.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.240]   You've been nice.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.320]   We've been a shtick of it.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.840]   I've been dismissive of the Chromebook.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.920]   And a lot of people still are.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.600]   They say, oh, it's just a browser pretending to be a computer.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.280]   But a few things have happened.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.560]   One is obvious, it's become more and more capable over time.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.840]   And there's more and more Chrome extensions.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.920]   There's now Chrome apps, which act pretty-- in fact, Chrome OS
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.760]   has become, in many respects, a full-blown OS.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.480]   You've got apps.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.320]   You've got a toolbar and all that.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.960]   But what was missing, I think, was decent hardware.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.960]   For me, Frank, most Chromebooks are $200 to $300.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.760]   They're junkie.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.040]   They're net-flow.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.160]   They're tinny.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.640]   So now, having played with the new Google--
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.840]   let me log into this before you show it.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.400]   The new--
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.000]   I have mine set up so I can log in with my watch.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.760]   That is awesome.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.640]   If you have Android 5 on your device, your watch will do it.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.000]   I mean, my phone.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.040]   God, if the watch did it, that'd be really awesome.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.240]   But if you have Android 5 on your smartphone,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.680]   yeah, it'll just log in automatically.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.080]   The screen is spectacular.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.960]   As good as any retina error, it's weird 3.2 still.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.840]   In fact, in any-- every way, that's the same, except Type-C
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   connector now, which I really like.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.680]   And there's two of them.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.320]   So you could put power on either side, video on either side.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.520]   USB is still there.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.600]   It still has an SD card slot, which is kind of a bad tease
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.160]   because I can't really do anything with it.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.200]   I shoot raw so it doesn't--
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.040]   There's no point in putting a card in there.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.720]   Although it does mount flush, which
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.280]   means you could use this as extra storage.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.360]   You put 128 gig SD card in there.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.240]   That's like a second hard drive, if you wish.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.440]   I try to go to Best Buy and Apple
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.160]   to buy a C to HDMI connector.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.800]   And you can't get it--
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   Not yet.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.320]   Really?
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.880]   You can get it from Google.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.920]   But you can't get it from Google.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.420]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.420]   You can get them online.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.800]   And Apple sells a $79 dongle, which really is overpriced.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.680]   So there's a couple of needed accessories.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.520]   That's certainly one as cheap Type-C interfaces.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.900]   And I'm sure Mono Price will do them
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.900]   because it's not proprietary.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.160]   It's not the MagSafe adapter.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.640]   Everybody-- Intel, Google, and Apple all involve the Type-C.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.280]   It's a standard.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.000]   So as far as I can tell, I've been doing a lot of inquiries.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.120]   This is a standard standard, standard.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.920]   Power and everything.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.680]   You could, for instance, have a Type-C power adapter
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.740]   from another manufacturer plug it in.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.060]   And it would work fine.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.340]   Even if the wattage isn't the same,
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.380]   it will trickle charge it or fast charge it
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.820]   or not use all the power available.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.420]   It'll work.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.300]   The other accessory that's needed is Steve Gibson
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.900]   came up with this.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.500]   And if anybody wants to steal this idea
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.700]   and do a Kickstarter, I encourage you,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.260]   he says you need a Type-C condom.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.860]   Because there is this issue that Type-C is not just power.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.220]   It's full USB data.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.840]   So the bad USB hack, which means that you can use this
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.600]   to modify the firmware on USB drives
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.820]   and make them very potent malware transportation devices,
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.820]   is a potential problem here.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.300]   Somebody could put a charging station in a coffee shop
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.660]   that would infect-- now, the good news about Chromebooks
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.960]   is there's nothing really to infect.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.760]   In fact, right.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.100]   These are very, very secure.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.620]   But nonetheless, certainly for the MacBook you'll want this,
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.940]   it would be simple enough to make a Type-C male to female cable
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.260]   that just carried the power lines, not any of the data.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.740]   All I see.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.860]   And you'd carry that with you.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.500]   You'd use that all the time.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.900]   Then you could safely connect to anything.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.140]   So that's a good market.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.860]   They shouldn't be more than a buck or two.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.420]   There's no special stuff in that.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.820]   I'm figuring 59 bucks on from Apple before you know it.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.020]   By the way, it's March 18th today, Jason.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.540]   Just not March 9th.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.060]   Ah, good catch.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.140]   I am really impressed with the keyboard, the screen, the trackpad.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.700]   Everything works very well.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.380]   The hinge is more solid.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.540]   The hinge was good before, but it's really good now.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.060]   And you don't mind the screen that it's 3.2?
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.660]   It's weird, but you get used to it.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.180]   Yeah, it's fine for me.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.660]   One thing that has really improved in the Chromebook
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.260]   is the ability to handle different size screens.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.300]   And I'll use that with this.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.220]   I'll use this as an example.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.940]   This came out today.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.100]   This is a new Acer Chromebook with a 15-inch screen.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.780]   And one of the things that's made it hard for me
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.300]   to recommend Chromebooks to its natural users of Chromebooks
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.660]   are older people, right, who really
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.620]   don't need anything more complex than a browser
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.380]   and email program, things and stuff like that.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.860]   Chromebooks are perfect for them.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.420]   They just can't get in trouble with them.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.420]   But the screens have been so crappy and small.
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.660]   It's hard to recommend it.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.860]   Even I have a hard time reading it.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.420]   Can you hide the screen real quickly
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.860]   while I log into my Google account on this?
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.740]   This one-- I'll show you what I've done.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.700]   I've made that-- because you have 15 inches now,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.060]   you can make this very easy to look at,
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.060]   because you now have two things you can change.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.060]   You can change the standard browser's zoom size,
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.300]   and you can change the standard text size.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.580]   So it's not this multi-problem of the other HD Chromebook.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.220]   This is so easy to use.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.460]   You see how big that--
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.700]   I can make it even bigger.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.940]   You see how big it is?
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.540]   And on a 15-inch screen, which--
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.100]   it's 1080p screen potentially, these
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.860]   could be very small.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.060]   But they're actually quite usable, I think.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.940]   So I think Google has solved a lot of the little things.
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.700]   And how much is that, Acer?
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.260]   $300.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.260]   Amazing.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.900]   So I've customized the fonts to be very large,
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.180]   but you can even go more in here.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.540]   You can change the kind of font.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.900]   There's a lot of information there.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.260]   You can use to your heart's content to make it legible.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.940]   And then you can set the standard page,
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.020]   which I've set to 150% on here, just as example.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.260]   Now, some of the icons on the Chrome,
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.300]   the user interface are still small, but usable.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.460]   And it's not touch.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.420]   It's not nearly as good a screen as the Pixel.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.700]   The thing that's great about the Pixel
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.980]   is it feels so fast, so fluid, so easy--
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.900]   and this isn't even the LS version--
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.980]   that you kind of-- some of the kind of qualms
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.300]   about using a Chromebook go away.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.220]   It feels like it's a real computer.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.620]   The beat is already amazing.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.020]   I got the LS.
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.060]   You did?
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.380]   There we go.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.380]   OK, so the Acer is my only machine.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.020]   I might as well-- you know, that's where I live with.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.500]   Right, why not?
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.100]   $200, $300 more.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.860]   The Acer boots in seven seconds, this thing.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.980]   I mean, it makes us do a reboot.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.580]   It feels like it's almost instant, right?
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.700]   Well, what's so great to you mentioned this last week, too,
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.380]   is the setup is nothing.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.700]   Every time I have to change the machines,
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.100]   it's always a day of this.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.900]   Don't you love that.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.740]   I forgot that.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.700]   And you turn it on and give it about four minutes, and it's done.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.100]   So let's see how fast it takes to boot.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.540]   I just shut it off.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.620]   Just tap--
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.060]   1,000, 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000, 3, 1,000, 4.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.940]   Did I tap it?
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.820]   No, it didn't shut off yet.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.020]   It takes a second to shut off.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.860]   OK.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.340]   Is it off?
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.540]   How do you even know?
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.780]   No light on the front.
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.380]   1,000, 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000, 3.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.460]   I love the screen back.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.300]   I'm 1,000.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.500]   That's it.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.740]   They almost instant, like four or five seconds.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.140]   This is kind of fun, too.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.620]   The rainbow little doohoo here.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.820]   You double tap it and you can see how much battery life is
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.660]   left, which is great.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.060]   So I'm 100% charged.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.180]   And the battery life, you haven't experienced this yet,
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.340]   Jeff.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.260]   9 to 12 hours, easy.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:51.820]   Oh, really?
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.980]   So it's legit.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.820]   Oh, it's legit.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.620]   And same thing with this Acer, because it's so big.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.380]   It's all battery in the insides.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.420]   Right.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.020]   That is fabulous.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.460]   These are heavier than errors.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.180]   That's the one thing.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.300]   They're not-- they're not--
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.860]   It feels like something--
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.820]   it's a utilitarian air.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.820]   Yeah, solid.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.100]   The square edges.
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.300]   It's very googly.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.700]   I love it.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.220]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:16.700]   Wow.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.140]   I think you're going to like yours a lot.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.980]   I mean, I'm curious what you say with the ludicrous speed
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.140]   version.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.540]   The only--
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.540]   There's nothing--
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:23.980]   Go ahead, back here.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.220]   Sorry.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.380]   There's nothing you want to do on a computer
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.260]   that you can't do on there.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.220]   Yeah, there's a few things.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.900]   I like to do computer programming.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.460]   I can't do most kinds of computer programming.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.340]   You can do App Inventor and stuff like that web-based
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.620]   programming, but I can't do the stuff I want.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.620]   When you can do a boat, you can do a boat too,
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.820]   not do a boat, but do a build too.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.220]   I played with Linux on this.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.860]   I decided not to do that.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.060]   The one thing I have done--
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.180]   I have SSH on here.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.420]   And so the one thing I have done is I can SSH to my Linux box
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.140]   and have a Linux command line easily.
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.660]   Right.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.860]   So--
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:03.900]   No, Matthew, the only thing is you don't edit video on it.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.220]   Can't video or photo--
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.260]   I mean, you can, but--
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.220]   Well, photo, you can't--
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.220]   you don't do what Leo does with his raw files on photo
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.220]   before I do for--
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:15.820]   you know, let me get a photo for a medium post, easy as pie.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.380]   You can also use Remote Desktop.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.980]   So I'm going to remote Desktop into my Mac Pro at home.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.460]   And don't look.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.780]   You have a security pin, which I'm just entered.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.500]   And now I can use my computer at home.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.580]   Is it 1, 2, 3, 4?
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.940]   Shoot, you saw.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.020]   You saw.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.500]   So I'm having some screen issues,
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.780]   but this is probably because I have my computer at home
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.700]   set a ridiculous screen resolution.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.780]   But basically, this is--
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.660]   that's my computer at home I'm looking at.
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.620]   This screen is my Mac Pro.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:57.260]   So you can, in fact, I guess do what you want.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.500]   But I think what you need is a desktop that can do all that
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.340]   stuff, and then this could be your note.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.780]   Listen, I think when you get--
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:14.820]   if I had Google Fiber at full speed,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.420]   you start to see doing video remotely.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.380]   There is a remote video plugin--
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.220]   Yeah, it exists.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.980]   But we video will do video editing.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.940]   And listen, it's always taken time
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.420]   to download the video to the machine.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.620]   You just upload it to the cloud instead,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.220]   and as long as you can get response there.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.940]   And the rendering is going to be faster up in the cloud
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.460]   than it is going to be on the local machine.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.140]   As more stuff uses HTML5, as Chrome gets more powerful,
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.420]   I love this little app drawer.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.580]   And by the way, you get this on Windows and Mac now, too,
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.020]   where you have what look--
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.260]   I mean, as for all intents and purposes,
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.300]   this looks like the task bar on Windows with all my icons here.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.100]   Whoosh your mouth out.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.660]   Well, I mean, it's-- or OK, the dock.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.780]   You have a start button where you have--
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.260]   these are the apps I have.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.100]   I can swipe through them, which is great.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.940]   And these-- it's pretty much everything I want.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.500]   The speakers on this are pretty decent still.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.740]   I think the old Pixel had very good speakers.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.340]   These are still pretty good here.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.060]   And there is a lot of image editing and even
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.700]   sort of minor video editing that you can do in the cloud.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.940]   You know, it's something my Tweep Deck app is great.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.440]   You know?
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:35.260]   Just assumed it would be all about the dates.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.060]   Oh, I can play that.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.940]   That's fine.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.700]   I hate that song.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:46.540]   So I think in general, this is like 90%
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.940]   of what most people do with their computing anyway.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.620]   100% in some cases.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.540]   And I was thinking--
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.100]   Yeah, you go ahead.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.540]   Actually, I'm trying to talk students into doing it.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.700]   You know, those who need to do video editing know not yet.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.060]   But everybody else is far cheaper.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.260]   And I was talking-- when I went last week to Madrid,
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.900]   I went to Prisa, the giant media company there with Opeis.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.980]   And they have an education arm.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.300]   And they're doing fascinating things in Brazil
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.260]   with a company that basically handles everything
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.220]   for a school from curriculum through technology.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.700]   And they, of course, because this is for well-to-do students
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.100]   and their families, they have iPads.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.580]   And I'm yelling at them saying, no, no, get Chromebooks.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.460]   So much better.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.860]   Yeah, it makes sense for students, for sure.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.180]   And I think for older folks as well,
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.940]   I'm thinking about my mom, you know,
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.860]   I got her a shitty netbook.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.140]   And it's garbage.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.740]   And I'm thinking, do I get her a tablet?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.900]   Should I get her Chromebook?
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.620]   You know, I want something that she can do things with,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.660]   but that's not going to cause a lot of problems.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.180]   We have to do tech support.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.260]   I think one of the things that's kind of intriguing
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.420]   is maybe we aren't paying enough for these, though.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.780]   Maybe we-- this pixel has shown me kind of--
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.740]   it really is a better experience with a--
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.780]   Well, this is the argument where.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.460]   Where is the $600?
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.420]   Wow.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.980]   I think the $9.99 one, I think this is the one people should get.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.460]   I know it sounds expensive, but this
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.140]   is going to last you for years.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.100]   Well, Leo, now that I have a Chromebook with lightning
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.980]   speed, I think I should abandon Skype.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.060]   I've been in Skype and go back to--
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.500]   There's one thing you can't do, although I imagine
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.300]   that's just around the corner at some point.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.580]   Yeah, I hope so.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.340]   Anyway, that's kind of--
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.780]   I scooped my before you by review,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.860]   but that's the-- basically right there, the review.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.740]   I'm impressed.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.100]   I am really impressed.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.580]   Hey.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.180]   And I feel like it should be--
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.180]   people should think about getting it.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.140]   I know $9.99.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.060]   It sounds like, geez, I don't know.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.100]   But I've always said that there's a false economy
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.260]   to gain cheap hardware.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.180]   Is it that much better than that Acer you showed?
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.380]   Well, god, that's a good question.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.060]   The Acer's a pretty good choice if you want a big screen.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.740]   I mean, what's nice-- that's the other thing that's nice
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.340]   is there's an ecosystem starting to evolve
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.300]   where they're not all the same.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.340]   The Acer's the first real--
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.620]   I mean, the 15-inch-- that's the first 15-inch screen.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.180]   And that really looks nice.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.660]   And the Toshiba is nice.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.660]   It's a bit of its HD, and the type is just too small for old eyes.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.500]   Right.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.380]   What I want-- what I think I said in the show before is what
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.820]   I really want is I want to go back to the original days of Dell
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.140]   where you could truly customize your own machine.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.860]   If I could get a machine from Dell with a touch screen and LTE
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.300]   and lots of memories, so on, I think
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.420]   you could put together the ultimate machine, which
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.100]   wouldn't probably cost $9.99, but would probably cost by $800,
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.460]   $750.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.420]   And it'd be a great machine and would have everything on one.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.340]   I was going to say, not having LTE.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.220]   I think you mentioned that, Jeff.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.060]   That's true.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.580]   That's true.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.080]   It's true.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:46.740]   And it's strange.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.220]   Why not?
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.420]   Why wouldn't it have it?
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.540]   My guess is 85% they say of the users of Chromebooks
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.540]   or Googlers, and they live invelked by a warm cloud of Wi-Fi
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.180]   and through their entire lives.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.220]   Most of us are now.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.260]   Most of us are now.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.220]   Well, many of us.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.700]   I go into offices.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.660]   I was at--
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.220]   Marketers Day yesterday.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.140]   And their tech department makes you give blood tests
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.260]   to get on and we'll put a chromium on silly.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.860]   So the LTE just connects and that's it.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.260]   And I'm on, no problem.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.020]   But not anymore.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.740]   Now I'm going to have to pull out a little box.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.780]   And who is your advertiser now for Wi-Fi connectivity?
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.540]   Wi-Fi?
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.780]   Do you have a stenchy one?
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.780]   I don't think so.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.300]   Oh, OK.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.860]   Didn't you get some new thing?
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.100]   Jeff, you mentioned--
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.380]   I did the karma.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.580]   Which the advantage of the karma is you pay for the gigs,
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.900]   no expiry.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.100]   So if you want to buy 10 gigs, you buy 10 gigs.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.700]   When you use it up, you use it up.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.700]   And I think it's $14 a gig, which is a little high.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.660]   But if you realize nothing ever expires,
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.660]   you're not buying a monthly--
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.340]   that makes more sense.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.740]   It's un-sprent.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.620]   Is it good coverage?
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.940]   It's sprint.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.900]   Now, what about tingle?
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.580]   Tingle?
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.340]   Tingle?
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:03.740]   Tingle?
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.740]   Ting.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.180]   Ting.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.380]   Tingles that other service that you use.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.380]   Right.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.780]   With chicks.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.260]   So Ting, I don't know whether they have--
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:27.620]   now you can buy Sims from them and do no longer just CDMA.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.740]   But I don't know if they have just data accounts.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.140]   Why if Google's going to do a wireless MVNO anyway?
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.500]   Why wouldn't they?
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.300]   Maybe that's what's going on.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.580]   Is there not going to put LTE in here until they have their own LTE
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.180]   card to put in it?
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.180]   Right.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:43.980]   Oh, baby.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.620]   That would be the way to do it, right?
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.700]   And then you're getting the best of sprint/t-mobile/wifi
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.100]   for very little money.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.860]   Maybe that's what we're waiting for.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.980]   Maybe they are going to-- they haven't--
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.860]   have they said, no, we're not going to do LTE.
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.900]   Reporter has asked and said, it wasn't like they were saying,
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.300]   as you thought last week, it wouldn't come out in two weeks.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:02.900]   Apparently not.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.540]   That, I believe.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.860]   But I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did something.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.300]   Or maybe they'll do a MyFi card with their new MVNO.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.500]   Because if you have a laptop that only
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.260]   works on the internet, then you kind of
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.900]   need to give people some way to always have the internet.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.400]   Right.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:24.060]   This works offline in a lot of respects,
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.140]   but it is, of course, better with online.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.940]   Can I tweet offline?
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.420]   No.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.100]   Do you need to tweet offline?
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.100]   Do you really want--
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.300]   I'm playing, it's fine.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.820]   Do you want to tweet from your flight?
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.300]   You can't MIRKAT from it either.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.940]   What?
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.540]   What good is that?
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.500]   You could have Google Hangouts.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.060]   That's so funny, because MIRKAT really isn't anything new at all.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.380]   Is it?
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:48.740]   There's just--
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.100]   No, no, no, not in any way.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.540]   In any way.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.020]   Just the name.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.140]   Well, and the easy, I guess, onboarding, I don't know.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.340]   OK.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.900]   But the concept is not new.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.540]   No, and it's like, oh, we've never seen anything like this.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.300]   It's so strange.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.500]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   Matthew Ingram is here.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.540]   So great to have him.
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.980]   You want to point people to your website, MatthewInGroom.com.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.900]   Best place to go?
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.580]   Sure.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.300]   I'm currently reconfiguring it.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.780]   So again, it's all under construction, but yeah, please drop by.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:25.820]   Do what Jason Snell did and just create your own thing.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.900]   We're so close.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.620]   You could do a-- people love you.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.220]   You could do a Patreon.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.100]   You could figure something out and do your--
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.900]   Are you tempted at all to go your own way?
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.300]   I am.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.140]   I definitely am.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.740]   I mean, I'm tempted.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.020]   I wrote-- one of the last things I wrote
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.620]   was about Ben Thompson, who runs the blog--
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.260]   It's Tectary.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.580]   --of the blog for Tectary.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.740]   Super smart guy, way smarter than I am.
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.820]   So that model might not work for me,
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.340]   but the fact that he's got thousands of subscribers
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.780]   and he's making a living, and he works on his own time
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.100]   and does what he wants and writes a newsletter.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:03.060]   And I mean, that kind of thing is super appealing.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.660]   But I just don't know--
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.060]   I have certain income requirements.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.820]   I have kids in university and a wife and so on.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.260]   I can't just sort of take six months off
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.180]   and see if I can make money on crowdsourcing.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.140]   But I mean, I've written enough about it.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.380]   It's hugely appealing.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.860]   Yeah, I mean, Ben is like Horace Dedier.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.740]   He's an analyst.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.260]   And so this stuff feels like analytics.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.820]   And you could see how people would say, OK,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.900]   I'm going to pay for that, because that helps me make money.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.780]   Pure journalism-- I know Jeff, you talk about this all the time.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.220]   Maybe that's a little harder to put behind a pay wall,
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.220]   but there must be other ways.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.020]   It's really hard.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.460]   It's really hard.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.460]   There must be other ways.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.420]   It's tempted to say you can do research reports, but--
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.380]   Yeah, that's still--
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.020]   And you can.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.580]   And conferences, yeah, that's the ticket.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.420]   Mm-hmm.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.740]   Yeah, that's the ticket.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.620]   Well, one thing Ben does in Horace and all these people
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.940]   is they appear on Twitter regularly.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.660]   And we are very happy to promote whatever you're doing, Matthew.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.100]   Great.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.020]   Well, I certainly appreciate being on top of the guys.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.140]   Oh, we love it, yeah.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.180]   Our show today brought to you by SmartThings.
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.340]   SmartPeople brought to you by SmartThings.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.340]   I like it.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.340]   SmartThings is smart.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.420]   If you're trying to automate your home, it's a solution.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.700]   Kind of everybody's been looking for for the longest time,
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.820]   which is how do I get all the different things,
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.500]   smart things in my home, to talk to one another,
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.100]   it started with a Kickstarter project
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.180]   for the SmartThings Hub.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.580]   And it has exploded to really incorporate--
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.180]   to encompass everything you're doing in your home,
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.100]   whether it's security, whether it's just convenience,
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.580]   whether it's monitoring.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.500]   SmartThings plays well with others, as they say,
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.860]   the Hub, interfaces to their iOS or Android app,
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:58.300]   and then interfaces to your eon labs, micro dimmer and key
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.180]   fob, your 2GIG programmable, Thammer thermostat,
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.780]   your Belkin Weemo, your--
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.660]   I mean, Dropcam Pro, your Nest, your Ecobee,
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.500]   your Ecolink door and Windows sensor,
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.980]   your everspring door and window.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.380]   I could just-- I mean, literally, I'm just
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.300]   going through the alphabet here.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:14.940]   Everything.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:20.020]   You're our Sonos speakers, you're in hugh lights.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:25.060]   And they can all work together to make your house a smart home.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.260]   The best way to start is with a SmartThings kit.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.220]   Once you get the kit, you're going
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.620]   to solve a particular problem.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.060]   They have solution kits for lighting automation, for instance.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.620]   That's what we're looking at right now.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.580]   Or security.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.180]   And we're going to get you 10% off that kit, the first kit,
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.940]   and free shipping in the US.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.940]   All you have to do is go to smartthings.com/twit.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.020]   You'll get the hub.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.740]   You'll get additional sensors.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.340]   And then, kind of the sky is the limit.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.060]   You now-- imagine using your smartphone app to say, good night.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.020]   And the lights turn off, the thermostat adjusts,
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.540]   the doors lock.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.060]   I still do that by hand every night.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.340]   It takes a while.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.660]   Be so cool, just press one button.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.820]   Set your lamps to brighten every morning at sunrise.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.380]   Or keep your home protected with home security, motion
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.460]   detection, water detection.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.140]   Your speakers could broadcast barking dogs
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.660]   when there's motion detected outside the house.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.220]   Or just a welcome home song when your children return.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:22.740]   I love it.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.580]   And I think you will, too.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.580]   I want you to go to smartthings.com/twit.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.020]   Save 10% off any home security or solution kit,
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.460]   free shipping in the US.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.700]   SmartThings was named Editors Choice at CES 2015.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.340]   I'm not surprised.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.820]   Smartthings.com/twit.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.500]   Give it a try.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.900]   Today you'll like it.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.100]   Google I/O registration opened yesterday.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.700]   Are you going, Jeff?
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.260]   I don't know.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.380]   I put in the request.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.380]   We shall see.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.740]   We got the same thing last.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.380]   They did this last year, too.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.140]   And we have about 10 people who want to go.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.740]   Yeah, I shouldn't take a spot for one of your guys who's--
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.180]   Well, we don't have to worry about Gina anymore.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:03.860]   She's on her own.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.380]   Right.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.380]   Right.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:05.900]   Right.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.700]   I think Jason--
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.500]   If you've already heard, maybe I haven't.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.660]   Maybe I'm going to go.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.660]   I know.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.780]   I think Robert-- it was weird.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.100]   Robert Ballisare was reaching out.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.300]   Father Robert, because he wanted to get programmers
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.060]   for our Coding 101 show.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.620]   And Google responded to him and said, yes, you have two
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.140]   for the entire organization.
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.380]   Thank God Robert is an honest priest.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.580]   And he said it on to me and said, that's up to you to decide.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.860]   Because I'm sure Robert would like to go.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.900]   But so would Mike Elgin.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.460]   So would you.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.660]   So would Jason.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.500]   So would a lot of people.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.260]   I don't want to go.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.820]   I'm going to stay here because I think they're going to stream
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.860]   the keynote as they usually do.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.060]   And we'll do our usual streaming coverage.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.260]   Registration goes till 5 o'clock tomorrow, 5 o'clock
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.420]   Pacific tomorrow, March 19.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.660]   And it's going to be another lottery.
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.220]   You'll have to apply when you get the invitation.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.420]   It's not free, $900 for an attendee, $300 if you're
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.780]   a student or a teacher.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.260]   Everybody has the same chance.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.460]   Google I/O is a lot of fun.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.740]   May 28th and 29th at Moscone West.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.540]   How did they decide?
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.540]   I imagine they have--
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.180]   Is it a lottery?
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.740]   I think they have a computer that'll do it.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.180]   You know what?
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.500]   They have not said.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.980]   They have not said because--
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.580]   You know what we need to know.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.940]   You wonder if there's maybe more than just a lottery involved.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.820]   I wonder.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.940]   I wonder.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.340]   A black box algorithm.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.540]   Well, we look at your page rank.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.180]   I don't know how they do.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:34.860]   Your club score.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.020]   I don't think they say it's random.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.500]   They don't, then it's not.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.060]   That's a good question.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.300]   They said that starting last year, they started to say,
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   yeah, it's randomly selected.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.300]   But I don't know how close to the truth that necessarily is.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.580]   Random ish.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.100]   Yes.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.180]   Random light.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.140]   We'll randomly select applicants
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.460]   from among all the qualified applications.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.180]   Qualified might be the word--
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.100]   Right, right, right.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.380]   --that is the little--
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.500]   not randomly.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.620]   So what they're going to do is go through a list
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.700]   and qualify people and then randomly select.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.340]   Right.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.660]   Presumably, they'll want you to be a developer or somebody
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.300]   who can bring something to the table, I would guess.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:18.940]   But I don't know.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.300]   And they don't say what qualified means.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.020]   The order in which application is received has no bearing.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.220]   You need to sign into Google, so it has to be your real Google
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:29.940]   account.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:35.260]   Should I apply?
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.900]   But I-- no, but see, I don't want to go.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.740]   So I shouldn't apply.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.500]   So Jason, here's the problem.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.660]   We need to tell them.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.980]   [LAUGHS]
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.540]   Before they tell us--
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.100]   [LAUGHS]
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.580]   [GRUNTS]
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.260]   Well, I will figure it out.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.020]   Jeff, you applied.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.460]   No, I applied through press.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.540]   I'm not a developer, so--
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:55.860]   Right.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.540]   Seminic progress fill out this form.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.980]   That's probably what happened.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.260]   Robert probably filled out that form.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.380]   Pressed and free, right?
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:03.740]   As usual.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.820]   But you still get the goodies.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.380]   [LAUGHS]
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.220]   I wonder if-- I guess they'll be given away
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.220]   a pixel, maybe.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.220]   Is there a chance to keep?
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.220]   Yeah, right.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.140]   We should get bonus points for having bought them.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.380]   Yes, sir.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.740]   Yes, sir.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.820]   I will be fun this year.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.500]   I mean, we heard about Lollipop last year.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   I don't know if we'll hear about what's good--
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.700]   I think you're also going to see you're going to see Sundar's--
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.660]   I mean, Sundar was the star of the show last year,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.300]   but he's really been in charge much.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:34.820]   Right.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.340]   All right.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:39.940]   Oh, there you go.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.740]   Google I/O coming up.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.900]   Interesting medium post by Astro Teller.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.980]   Astro, I didn't know, for instance, is not his real name.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.820]   [LAUGHS]
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.660]   It's Eric.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.380]   He's the head of Google X, the moon shots.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.980]   And this is part of the new back channel, which
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.620]   is Stephen Levy's little corner of medium.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.740]   This is the journalistic corner of medium.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:06.980]   One of them, yeah.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.100]   It's his little job.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.740]   It's his white magazine.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.380]   And this is basically a transcript of his speech,
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:18.500]   of Astro's Teller's speech at South by yesterday.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.420]   So some very interesting stuff in here,
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.620]   if you haven't read it.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.540]   They made a ECG vest.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.380]   That was his first startup in 1999.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.140]   And it was really cool.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:34.020]   In fact, I think-- I'm pretty sure this is the body media vest.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.460]   I wore this or somebody wore this
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.780]   during the screensavers at Tech TV
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.740]   so that you could see, in real time, heart rate, blood pressure,
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.980]   electrocardia crayon as the hostess hosting the show.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.260]   I'm pretty sure-- unless I had a bad nightmare,
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.860]   I'm pretty sure we did that.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.980]   He said, the problem is we got a bunch of older people
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.300]   and people who would theoretically be wearing this vest.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.300]   And they-- 65 to 80.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.340]   And they said they hated it.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.420]   And we said, well, would you wear it if it would save your life?
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.620]   I don't know.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.420]   Maybe.
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.500]   Well, OK, what if we made it so you could fly?
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.820]   I guess.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.260]   Sometimes, maybe.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.980]   But old people are like that.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.140]   They're not going to say yes, no.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.100]   What if you could fly there for free?
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.740]   I don't know.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.340]   I'm happy right here.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.660]   I'm trying to get my parents a tablet.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.660]   I miss my show.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.980]   My life is worth.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.180]   Oh, are we going to be like that, Jeff?
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:30.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.540]   No.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.860]   Matthew says yes.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.500]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.860]   No, I'm fine.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.340]   I'm good.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:35.340]   I'm good.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.980]   I like the old phones.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.340]   When will that happen?
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.740]   Before you realize it.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.740]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.980]   There's wee harden in our ways, I guess.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   I'm starting to get--
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.980]   You have to look through virtually.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.340]   I know I understand why I know new computer.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.740]   Chrome is just fine.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.340]   It has been for years.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.940]   I feel it's already happening to me.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.340]   I don't want to go out anymore.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.340]   So Google X-- one of the first projects he says
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.340]   was called Genie.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.340]   Was to fix the way buildings are designed and built by building
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.340]   an expert system, a software genie.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.340]   Did you ever hear about this?
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.340]   I never heard about this.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.340]   Never heard about that.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.340]   It worked on it for 18 months, spun it out to a standalone
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.340]   business where it has been growing and thriving
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.340]   for the last two and a half years.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.340]   OK.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.340]   Then they did flux.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.340]   Oh, no.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   The company is now called Flux.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.340]   Huh.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.340]   OK.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.340]   I think Loon is one of my favorites, not just because of the name,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:43.340]   because it's a Canadian bird, but just the idea.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.340]   I remember when they first announced it.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.340]   I thought it was April Fools.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.340]   Right.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.340]   Which is great.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.340]   Like it sounded satirical.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.340]   It was so loony.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.340]   You know?
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.340]   We're going to float balloons around the world and give people
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.340]   Internet.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.340]   I'm like, sure.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.340]   Yeah, right.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.340]   Project Wing, the self-flying delivery drone.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:07.340]   The Loon balloons actually are going to-- I think they're going
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.340]   to be real, aren't they?
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.340]   Yeah, they are.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.340]   They are.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.340]   They totally are.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.340]   How about this makani?
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   An airborne wind turbine.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.340]   An energy kite.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.340]   Cool idea.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.340]   Isn't that cool?
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.340]   Very.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.340]   The higher up you go, the faster you're going to be more
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.340]   consistent at the wind is.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.340]   So if you put the turbines up in the air and the speed,
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.340]   the stop right there.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.340]   When was it?
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.340]   The power of the wind goes up with the cube of the wind speed.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.340]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.340]   So that makes a huge difference.
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.340]   But so does the weight of the turbine.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.340]   Oh, that's not.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.340]   So that's the key, right?
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.340]   Is to make something light.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:58.340]   The makani energy kites are 1% as much as a standard, you know,
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.340]   turbine in a tower.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.340]   And the center of the virtual circle draws in the sky is at
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.340]   250 meters where the winds are stronger and more consistent.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.340]   And as you said, considerably more powerful.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.340]   The thing that I thought was most interesting was some of the
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.340]   places where he talks about how they failed.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.340]   Right.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   And sort of why they failed.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.340]   And like Google Glass, you know, got too much attention and was
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.340]   sort of seen as a finished product when it wasn't, which was
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:31.340]   kind of my sense of why it didn't maybe do as well.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.340]   But the other one was, I think it was Project Loon.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.340]   He said they massively underestimated the difficulty of
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:41.340]   keeping the balloons aloft, like we're off by a factor of 10 or
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.340]   100.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.340]   So not just a little.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.340]   An order of magnitude wrong.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.340]   I just, I find it impressive that he would even admit that, you
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.340]   know, yeah, except that much.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.340]   That failure was followed by a success in which they figured out
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.340]   how to make them stay up much longer than they had thought.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   So they, so that's the challenge, right?
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.340]   You take the, you take the failure and you make it into
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.340]   something.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.340]   He says, we've mostly fixed this problem with the time.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.340]   It was quite stressful.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.340]   Now thankfully balloons stay up for six months at a time.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.340]   Well, beyond the three months we need for a viable service.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.340]   There's the little self driving car.
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.340]   And his point about that is, is similar to, you know, all the
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.340]   great ideas when you're coming up with the concept don't, well,
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.340]   amount to a hell of beans, but a small hill means it's not until
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.340]   you actually test product in real world conditions.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.340]   You start to suddenly realize the things you got wrong or the
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.340]   things that you didn't anticipate would be a huge deal.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.340]   He also says, as they get better at it, that's a problem
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.340]   because it's failure that teaches them.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.340]   So the longer the amount of time between our failures, the
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.340]   harder it is for us to improve.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.340]   That was very an interesting insight.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.340]   They're not failing enough.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.340]   It's not.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.340]   It's too good.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.340]   Yeah, you guys are too good.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   Stop succeeding.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:01.340]   So I think that's the whole idea of failure is just so
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.340]   fascinating.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.340]   I had a long conversation with the German or Austrian
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.340]   journalist today who was going on with me in talking to me
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.340]   after I had done my attack on Der Spiegel.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.340]   We talked about Tuezco.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.340]   And, you know, I keep on saying that the Europeans have to have
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.340]   more willingness to develop in public, which means fail in
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.340]   public and that that's a precursor.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.340]   And yes, we in America fetishize failure.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.340]   I always make that joke, but I'm not so sure that's true now.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.340]   I think that it's just a method of being open and learning in
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.340]   public and improving something in public.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.340]   And you look at his talk about saying, oh, yeah, we learned a
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.340]   big lesson about privacy in Google Glass.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.340]   People didn't like how to not have no the picture was taken.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.340]   So, you know, it wasn't that, oh my God, they've done something
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.340]   horrible and it's frozen or evil.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.340]   No, they learned.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.340]   Learning is okay.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.340]   So here's a good one they learned with the self-driving
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.340]   workers.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.340]   He said, you know, we knew that if the car drove itself, people
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.340]   would, you know, maybe not pay as much attention as they ought to.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.340]   You know, they'll say, oh, no, no, I'm going to keep my, I'm
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.340]   nervous.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.340]   I'm going to keep my hands.
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.340]   He said, as soon as we started doing stuff, people were doing
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.340]   horrendous things.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.340]   They were just, they were crawling into the back seat.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.340]   They were just, they, it was just horrible.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.340]   So he said, we realized that the only way to make that, that
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.340]   would work is to make it truly self-driving.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.340]   So we took the steering wheel out.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.340]   They said, if it doesn't go from point A to point B without any
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.340]   human intervention, it's no good.
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.340]   If it requires any human invention, it's going to be a horrific
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.340]   failure because humans, as soon as they think the car's got
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.340]   it covered, just go, okay, see ya.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.340]   There's no backup system.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.340]   There's no, it's like they are not the backup system and don't
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.340]   count on them.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.340]   He says, people already do stupid things like texting when
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.340]   they're supposed to be a hundred percent in control.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.340]   So imagine what happens when they think the car's got it
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.340]   covered.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.340]   It's a big thing.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.340]   So that's actually a good explanation.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.340]   I was wondering why you take it steering wheel out.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.340]   Isn't that a comfort factor for humans?
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.340]   That there's a break, there's a pedal, there's something I can
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.340]   do if the machine fails.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.340]   Great, great.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.340]   That's really interesting.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.340]   The human engineering part of a non-human.
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.340]   That's kind of fun.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.340]   Probably always do, don't you?
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.340]   You always have to take a, take humans are the thing that
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.340]   screws everything up.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.340]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.340]   Well, and I forget who said it, but my dad who was in the
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.340]   Air Force used to love the line, no battle plan ever survived
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.340]   contact with the enemy.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.340]   So you can have all the great ideas and plans you want, but
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.340]   people will find a way to do something you didn't expect.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.340]   U.S.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.340]   DeWiz in our chat room says, well, why does it have rearview
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.340]   mirrors that if the humans aren't necessarily?
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:41.340]   Well, those aren't really rearview mirror sensor cameras.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.340]   The little wings sticking out, they're not for you.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.340]   I want this car and I will come to work each and every day in
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.340]   it.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.340]   And I don't care even a, you know, Buckminster Fuller, the
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:58.340]   great Bucky created something called remember the Dimaxion car.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.340]   He said, there's crazy, we're making cars that are not
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.340]   aerodynamic.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.340]   He designed it like a teardrop.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.340]   It had some very odd features and it was three wheeler, I
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:12.340]   believe, and it never got anywhere because somebody got
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.340]   killed in it.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.340]   It had a fatal accident.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.340]   I did wonder about the car.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.340]   This car is four wheels in those specific positions.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.340]   Is that the best model for a car?
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.340]   Is it just because that's what we expect it to look like?
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.340]   I think you have to, as you said, human factors still coming
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.340]   up.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.340]   As long as it has lots of cup holders, I think it'll be
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.340]   pretty successful.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.340]   We had a cup holder.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.340]   It's not a car.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:45.340]   The president of our CEO Ford at one point, I think it was,
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.340]   said they can talk about all the features they want in their
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.340]   new cars and all people care about is they want more cup
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.340]   holders.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.340]   Yep.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.340]   Well, that was, that was the great thing about the, the
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.340]   Homer, Homer Simpson's car.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.340]   It had tons of cup holders.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.340]   Yep.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.340]   That's important.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.340]   And shag carpeting.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:14.340]   So Bonapatit had an article on the history of the car cup holder.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.340]   Oh, really?
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   Just in case.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:23.340]   I don't know why it's in Bonapatit.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.340]   Ever since George Washington crossed the Delaware to go sign
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.340]   the lease on his new pickup truck, President's Day has been
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.340]   associated with getting a good deal on a car.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:34.340]   And while some people buy car based on gas mileage and sporty
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.340]   cars, we all know the most important part of a vehicle is
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.340]   its cup holder.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.340]   Look at that.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:44.340]   Snack tray for car from modern mechanics.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.340]   It holds a Coke bottle.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.340]   Real demand for the cup holder didn't pick up into the
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.340]   50s.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.340]   When drive-ins and drive-through windows became main
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.340]   states of American eating, the very earliest evidence of a
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.340]   complete cup holding comes from a 50s newspaper clipping that
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.340]   describes the snack tray for car that hangs from dashboard.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.340]   When I was in high school, we still had an A&W that would
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.340]   bring the trays out.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.340]   Hang them on your other side of the car.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.340]   Oh, high school.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.340]   We had one in Petaluma until a few years ago.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.340]   Really?
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.340]   Then the waitresses were on roller skates.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.340]   Yes.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.340]   I thought it was cool.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.340]   I liked going there.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.340]   It's the best thing ever.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.340]   You roll your window down.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.340]   She takes your own skates back.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.340]   Everybody else can get out of the car.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.340]   No, it's so great.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.340]   The best beverage security system of the era belonged to the
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.340]   1950 Cadillac El Dorado Broim.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.340]   Plenty of ultra luxurious limousines has built in bars,
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:38.340]   but the Broim, how do you say that, Broim?
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.340]   It was the first to--
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.340]   Broim.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.340]   Broim.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.340]   It was the first to come with a magnetized glove compartment
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.340]   door and a set of four metal tumblers.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.340]   Oh, geez.
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.340]   Perfect for keeping your cognac stable while you're
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.340]   passing the jutney on the way to the Hamptons.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:59.340]   Patents for the '70s for a more advanced version of Clyde
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   Morgan's pullout tray.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:05.340]   But customers looking for a car with a built-in cup holder
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.340]   were stuck in the wilderness until 1983 when Chrysler invented
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.340]   the minivan.
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.340]   That is the first you're looking--
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:14.340]   Oh, wow.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.340]   If you're watching the video, that is the first minivan,
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.340]   the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.340]   Same car, different names.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.340]   Your sucks appeal.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.340]   Wow.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.340]   That's hot.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:30.340]   They had two cup holders sunk into the plastic of the dashboard.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:35.340]   But it would take another decade for that to become ubiquitous.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.340]   And that shows what's so wrong about Detroit.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.340]   If they had a way to listen to the public.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.340]   We all want to told them cup holders and plugs for our Walkmen.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.340]   You know what happened in 1994?
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:57.340]   A 79-year-old woman Stella Liebeck sued McDonald's after
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:01.340]   spilling a 180-degree coffee in her lap in a stationary card.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:05.340]   Car, she got $2.7 million.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.340]   That's a famous case.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.340]   Very famous.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.340]   That judgment was actually reversed.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.340]   You're right.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.340]   She only got 640,000 on appeal.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:20.340]   The case became fodder for endless Leno monologues in a national
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.340]   argument about tort reform, but also a strong argument for the
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.340]   industry-wide adoption of the cut cup holder.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.340]   If the car she'd been sitting in her grandson's Ford Probe had
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.340]   even one single cut cup holder, the whole night deal might have
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.340]   been in a flight.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.340]   So there you go.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.340]   It's a metaphor.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   It's a very first cup holder for reels in the 1984 Chrysler.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.340]   Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.340]   Boy, that's an ugly ass car.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.340]   Even an ugly color-like kind of dopey brown.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.340]   Mm-hmm.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.340]   And that's a--
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.340]   We had a caravan.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.340]   With the faux woody look on the--
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.340]   I'm not surprised.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.340]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   I'm not at all surprised.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.340]   All right.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.340]   I don't know how-- how do we go to-- that's what I love about
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.340]   this show.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.340]   It's about Google, the cloud, and cup holders or whatever they
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.340]   are.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.340]   It's-- we're-- you're up in the cloud.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.340]   You have low oxygen.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   Does your Chromebook have cup holders?
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.340]   No.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.340]   No.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.340]   Very disappointing, I might add.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.340]   You know what I'm excited about?
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.340]   [CHUCKLES]
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:29.340]   The Google has now an API for Google now, or is going to.
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.340]   Mm.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.340]   That's a big deal.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.340]   That's a big deal.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.340]   That's a big deal.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.340]   That's a big deal.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.340]   This is the article from the next web.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:42.340]   Martin Bryant writing, "Google now will one day be able to work
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.340]   with information from all the apps you use."
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.340]   I didn't know there was a pilot program with 40 third-party
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:48.340]   services already.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.340]   I didn't know that either.
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.340]   But this is again from South-- yeah, this is from South by--
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.340]   you're wearing a great article.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:04.340]   This is from South by Aparna Chenaprakdaaprakda, director of--
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.340]   I actually came really close to getting to nail on that.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.340]   Aparna Chenaprakda, director of product management for Google
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:15.340]   now gave an interesting insight at South by-- at a marketing land
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   Denny Sullivan session at South by-- when asked by Nittendi
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.340]   how Google now will handle competing data from rival apps,
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.340]   she said, "Individual user app usage patterns would help guide
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   what data should be shown."
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.340]   I think it's smart.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.340]   I mean, I remember when I first saw Google now and I thought,
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.340]   "What if this could show me not just things that are in my
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.340]   Google calendar, but any type of information, news, weather,
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.340]   sports, all sorts of things.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.340]   It's a potential pipeline for all the information you need to
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.340]   know right now on your phone.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.340]   That's huge."
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:54.340]   Yeah, I mean, one of the things she raises is the notion of,
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:59.340]   you know, you could have a card at the amusement park that would
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.340]   then tell you, "Hey, the ride is ready for you."
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.340]   Your auction-- here's some from the Wired slide.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.340]   Your auction ends in one hour and 22 minutes or QR code from
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.340]   Walgreens.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.340]   Because your near Walgreens, here's some coupons or balance
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.340]   or balance rewards points.
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.340]   You know, this is great stuff.
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:25.340]   The Danny Sullivan panel was cut short at South By By a
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.340]   false fire alarm.
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:28.340]   Oh, sure.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.340]   Which happened to me, by the way.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.340]   I went to a Mark Cuban talk at South By a few years ago.
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.340]   Really?
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:38.340]   And Mark was being his typical nasty self.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.340]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.340]   And the fire alarm went off and I took that as an excuse to get
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.340]   the hell out of there and never went back.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.340]   We had one go off at a gig of home event, too.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.340]   But you see us have--
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.340]   I think there's someone from TechCrunch pulled it.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.340]   There's some renegade, yeah.
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.340]   Competitor going around pulling fire alarms.
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.340]   So there'll be an API.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.340]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.340]   What's the difference then between now and notifications on
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:06.340]   your phone?
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.340]   Don't they merge?
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.340]   Again, now notifications, don't I?
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   I think I do.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.340]   Yeah, I do.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.340]   Please.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.340]   Now it's pushed versus pull is what it is.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:23.340]   So notifications are pushed to you and get your attention.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.340]   But I love the idea of saying, well, let me go look at my now
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.340]   dashboard and seeing what's going on.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.340]   And so that's pulled, right?
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:34.340]   Except it's pushed to the pull.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.340]   So here's the other question.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:40.340]   For the 40 that are doing this,
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.340]   is that opt-in now for us with now?
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:48.340]   Yeah, you have to have the app of the service installed.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.340]   And then it taps into that.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.340]   And as you can do with any Google now cards also, you can kind of
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.340]   say don't show me any more of this.
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:58.340]   Yeah, but how do I turn that on?
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.340]   Like I wait my beloved ways.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.340]   I don't think it comes into now for me, but I use ways every day.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.340]   Is ways put one of the 40?
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.340]   I honestly don't know.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.340]   It is that.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:13.340]   So do I turn on now for an app?
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   Well, that's what she's saying.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.340]   She's saying that Google looks at your usage to decide what to put in now.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.340]   So this is where I do have a problem.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.340]   Everybody else raves about now.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.340]   And I don't like now, but I don't get a lot now.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.340]   Right, you need more.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.340]   Yeah, I don't get that much.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.340]   You know, it's also doing surveys to identify what people want.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.340]   She says we also use personal experiences of Visit to Disneyland
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:39.340]   inspired her to get the team working on support for theme park ride queue.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:43.340]   I will say I used Google now a lot more when I was traveling.
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.340]   So I was in a different country.
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.340]   I didn't know where I was going.
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.340]   You know, I needed that's true.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.340]   I needed traffic information.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.340]   If I'm just going from my house to the shopping mall and back or to pick up my
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:57.340]   daughter, Google now is pretty useless because it's not going to tell me anything.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.340]   I don't already know.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.340]   Right.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.340]   So also, are you interested in this new location?
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.340]   You know, the seven eleven five miles away.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.340]   But when I was in Italy, it was it was a lifesaver.
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:18.340]   I mean, I think I were told you guys I slid it up by mistake and it said, Hey,
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.340]   your flight's delayed.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.340]   And there's traffic on the highway heading to the airport.
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:25.340]   I'm like, thank you so much for telling me that.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.340]   It's like the most important information I've found out today.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:33.340]   Actually, this is I'm so looking by now now and I've got calendar appointments.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:38.340]   I've got news stories that are referred to searches I've made in the past.
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:43.340]   And I've got places nearby, but I just got one that was kind of interesting and said,
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.340]   I see there's something going on at one o'clock tomorrow.
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.340]   Do you want me to add that to your calendar?
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.340]   And I guess it's not in my email, but it wasn't a confirmation because I am
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.340]   flying to Vegas at one o'clock tomorrow.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:57.340]   So I said, yeah, so that so it actually added something to my.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.340]   I love the parking location.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.340]   That's nice.
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.340]   That was where I parked.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.340]   Yeah, I get that one.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:04.340]   My AT&T bill is due tomorrow.
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.340]   See, I don't get any of this stuff.
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.340]   Mine says tell Jeff that Google now is really useful.
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.340]   Mine, you know what mine does all the time?
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.340]   Mine just gives me honesty.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.340]   I get this all the time.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.340]   It gives me stories about Chromebook and Edward Snowden.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.340]   Well, you got to do more searches on Google, I guess.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.340]   And smartphones and tablets.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.340]   The Snowden thing, the Internet is pushing.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.340]   We know we're watching you.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.340]   You might as well watch back.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.340]   Stories to read.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.340]   That's it.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.340]   That's all I ever get.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.340]   And I get the card that says it's, you know, it's some horrible amount of
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.340]   time to get home for you.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.340]   You poor schmuck.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.340]   Take a helicopter.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.340]   If only.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.340]   If only.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:51.340]   So is it you that put this Nick built in a story in the rundown?
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:55.340]   The health concerns in wearable tech.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.340]   Jesus.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.340]   It's driving me nutty.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:02.340]   Well, I put it, I put the two of them together because you because you have on
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.340]   the one hand Google just got a patent for curing cancer with a watch.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:09.340]   Then you have Nick built and who's turned into the whiny nanny of the technology
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.340]   world.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:17.340]   And this story really bothers me because it's it's really fluffing around the
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.340]   facts because it's saying well, cell is bad for you.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.340]   But most watches, most smart watches don't have cell.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.340]   They only have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.340]   By the way, we all put Bluetooth in our ears thinking it's safer than putting
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.340]   the phone by our ear.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:34.340]   So now suddenly having Bluetooth in your watch is going to give you cancer
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.340]   and kill you.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:39.340]   Well, and so we also there is no evidence that cell phone radiation is bad for you.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.340]   That too.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.340]   So, you know, he tries to use that.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.340]   It's it's a real it's a real straw man with a match.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:49.340]   He's adding Dr. Joseph Mercola, who is not a credible.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:53.340]   And this piece, you know, Nick, I like Nick next to the nice guy.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.340]   We love it.
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:59.340]   But he's tried too hard to go from future man to Fred Flintstone.
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   And I live in the future and now I really hate it.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.340]   I don't like it very much.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.340]   He wrote this book was I live in the future.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.340]   Now it's now I don't like it so much.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:12.340]   So we try to shift off and I wonder if this is the time I was telling him we need an
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.340]   anti editor and anti technology.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.340]   But don't do it.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.340]   Don't do it.
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:17.340]   No.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.340]   Because this is not this this fluff spy.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.340]   And I know what we're going to hear is the New York Times said these more
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.340]   things are going to be bad for you.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.340]   You're going to get cancer.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.340]   They're going to kill you.
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.340]   Right.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.340]   You know, my watch has Wi-Fi.
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.340]   I mean, I don't even it has a Wi-Fi.
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.340]   It has Bluetooth in it.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.340]   It does have Wi-Fi.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.340]   That's something we learned by the way, which is kind of interesting.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.340]   The Apple Watch.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:39.340]   Apple was very made a big deal about how we not only use Bluetooth, but we use Wi-Fi so
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:45.340]   that as long as you're within your Wi-Fi network, your Apple Watch can talk to your Apple
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.340]   phone.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.340]   It needs an Apple phone so that it can do its thing.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.340]   So you can leave your phone in your bedroom and go throughout your house.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:55.340]   As long as you're still in it or conversely in your office and go throughout your office,
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.340]   as long as you're still on the same Wi-Fi network, it'll work.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.340]   And that was like, wow, that's great.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.340]   And then somebody, I guess Google said, oh, yeah, Android Wear Watch is all have Wi-Fi
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.340]   and it too.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.340]   We're going to have to turn that on with firmware soon.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.340]   I didn't know this had Wi-Fi.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.340]   What?
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.340]   Might as well put it in.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.340]   It's a tiny chip.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.340]   I guess it's a cheap chip and they can just stick it in there.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:17.340]   I think it's very intriguing.
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:24.340]   It seems like almost an intentional effort to have hidden features that you slowly enable,
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:27.340]   like the battery life has gotten better and better and better and better.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:34.340]   That's actually one of the things I'm fascinated with, whether it's Tesla cars or, you know,
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:39.340]   there are more and more things that are effectively getting smarter and better over firmware updates
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.340]   that come over the air.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:44.940]   So instead of having to take your car into the shop, Tesla can actually change the height
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.940]   of your, the chassis of your car with a firmware update.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:49.940]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:50.940]   Fascinating.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:52.940]   Well, everything we have, I guess, is kind of like that.
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:53.940]   Mm hmm.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:54.940]   Very intriguing.
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:58.940]   Was this supposed to be a Tesla announcement today or something that the bus said, I'm
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.940]   going to solve all your problems with battery worry.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:02.940]   You see that story?
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:03.940]   Not yet.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:05.940]   I remember him mentioning that.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:06.940]   Why don't you find it?
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:07.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:08.940]   Take a break while you look.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.940]   How about that?
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.940]   All right.
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:15.900]   Again, Google in the cloud and all that stuff and cup holders with Matthew Ingram, late of
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.860]   giga-ome now at Matthew Ingram.com at Matthew.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.140]   I on Twitter, do you do meerkat?
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.140]   I do not.
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.140]   I have not meerkat it.
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.140]   Okay.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.540]   Just going to give you a chance if you do to.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:27.540]   Okay.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.540]   It's ridiculous.
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.140]   Here we are in a live streaming studio.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:35.340]   I do more streaming hours of video than any human alive.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:38.940]   And half my staff is now meerkatting everything.
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.940]   Jeff Niedels is like number five.
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:47.940]   People were watching Jimmy Fallon.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.940]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:49.940]   Rehearsing.
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.580]   I had a thousand people watching meerkat and I think I broke it because it stopped at
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:55.940]   $9.99 and never went beyond that.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.180]   In fact, then stopped you.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.180]   So what is you?
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.180]   What are your number three?
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:00.180]   Who is number one?
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:01.180]   Mashable.
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:02.180]   Mashable.
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.180]   Jimmy Fallon.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.180]   Jeff Niedels, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.180]   What?
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.900]   He wasn't even in South by Southwest.
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.900]   What?
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.500]   He found his thing.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.500]   He found his calling.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.500]   You know what he does?
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.980]   He's a meerkat all the time.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:15.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:16.980]   Okay.
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.100]   There's a market for that.
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.100]   What happens on needle vision?
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.060]   What happens on needle vision?
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.140]   We talk.
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.380]   He interviews people.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:26.860]   It's crazy.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.820]   You know the best thing about meerkat?
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:30.820]   What?
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:31.820]   The name.
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:32.820]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.500]   I mean, you stream whatever.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.700]   But meerkat?
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.180]   You stream sounds like a urinate tract infection.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.860]   Meerkat, a few little fuzzy animal.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:44.540]   Don't cross your meerkats.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.540]   Mm-mm.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.740]   Getting really used to the meerkat posture.
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:50.660]   You know someone's meerkatting when you walk around the corner and someone's standing there
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.660]   like this.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.660]   I'm meerkatting.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:53.660]   No, sorry.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:54.660]   You got meerkatting.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:55.660]   I'm meerkatting.
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:57.660]   You're walking around like this everywhere.
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:58.660]   I'm meerkatting.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:02.460]   We actually had to formulate company rules about meerkatting.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.100]   You can't just meerkatting people.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.900]   Well, because people are going around, there's screens open with financials on it.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.580]   There's whiteboards with show ideas on it.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.740]   You can't just go around all the time.
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   Meerkatting with the--
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.740]   For those of them, not them, or whatever?
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740]   You have to have meerkat rules.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.060]   Pretty soon you'll go to the gym and it'll say no cell phones and no meerkatting.
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.900]   Leave meerkat at the door.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.820]   Leave meerkat at that periscope.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.500]   Twitter's slow to emerge.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.740]   My competition is now starting a-- Kevin Rose tweeted today, "I saw it.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.740]   It's amazing."
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740]   So--
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.740]   So you dumbed him.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.140]   Meerkatting is way better.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.980]   Way better than periscope.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:42.980]   You think that's it?
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.980]   It's just the name?
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.380]   Well, I think it helps.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.140]   Definitely helps.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:54.620]   Had Google put something like Meerkat on Google Glass, would it be-- would it have been as
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620]   big?
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620]   No.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.620]   No.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.700]   It would have caused war in Europe.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.220]   I think it's hard for-- like Google-- it's hard for Google or Facebook to do those kinds
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.460]   of things because they're these giant entities that everybody kind of slightly mistrusts.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.460]   Right.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.460]   Whereas if it's just a guy, "Hey, I came up with this new thing.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.460]   It's cool.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.460]   You should use it."
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.460]   People are like, "All right, I'm in."
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.220]   We're going to take a break.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.260]   When we come back, we're going to talk about the New York Police Department and their new
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.980]   spot-shatter system.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.980]   This is a good one.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.980]   Thank you, chat room.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:32.700]   The first word from legalzoom.com.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:37.900]   You may be thinking right about now, "You know, I need a law firm."
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.700]   Actually LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.700]   Actually, better.

[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.260]   I can't recommend them more highly.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:07.500]   Matthew Ingram, Jeff Jarvis, Leo Laporte, this week in Google.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.800]   Police officers, thank you, Chatham, for this story.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:17.760]   From MSNBC, police officers in New York City have now a new technology called Spot Shorter.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.200]   You might be happy to hear this, Jeff.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.780]   With it, they can detect gunshots in real time.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.780]   It's not that new.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:29.940]   What's new in this story is that they're installing it in new neighborhoods and they
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.340]   are finding there are more gunshots than they do.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.900]   The $1.5 million system uses 300 sensors to triangulate the location of a gunshot to
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.180]   within 25 meters of where the bullet was fired within seconds.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.660]   It sends a notification to an operator who reviews the audio file to determine if it
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:50.680]   actually was a gunshot or maybe fireworks or an engine backfire.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.080]   The system then forwards an alert to the NYPD with relevant information about the number
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.160]   of shots fired, a map of the location, and if the shooter was moving.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.840]   That's the Twitter feed you want?
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.840]   Wow.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.200]   Seems like that sending it to an operator introduces, you know, it's going to slow things
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   down a fair bit.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.960]   If someone has to listen to the file and then was that a gunshot?
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.960]   Was it a card door to slamming?
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.200]   I think it's interesting that there are people who can tell the difference.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:25.000]   In cities around the country, according to the chief of police in New York City, Mr.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:35.840]   Bratton, William Bratton, in 75% of the cases, they're not dialed in the 911.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.840]   75%?
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.040]   Because people go exactly that.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.040]   Oh, I must have been a fire worker backfire.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:52.400]   For that reason, I'm now thinking of the Batman scene where he has all the cell phones up
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.760]   on a screen and you can listen to any conversation.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.640]   And I'm sure they're not working on that.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   Oh, no.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   They would never do that.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   Yeah, I would not.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.640]   This is fine.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   This is just gunshots.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.840]   Yeah, only gunshots.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.800]   If they happen to hear anything else, they can just throw that out.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   They would ignore it.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   Sure.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   It's a good point, Matthew.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.920]   They have an array of microphones in every borough of Manhattan, New York.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.280]   Like if you said stick them up or, you know, they send that to an operator to determine
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.960]   how serious you were.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   That's a good point.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.800]   They have microphones now recording constantly every all over New York.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.560]   They're extremely close.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560]   They are.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   Well, this is sensor.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.320]   I mean, they're going to be sensors of all kinds.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:41.720]   You know, just just everybody's phone is going to be listening to these kinds of things.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.240]   If you could get Google fiber, wouldn't you subscribe in a heartbeat?
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.840]   Why is it that only 29,867 people have subsided?
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.840]   No, that's for the that's for the TV package.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.840]   Oh, that's the TV.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.680]   I think that's what that's your right.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.680]   It is.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.680]   That's what it is.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:03.960]   I misunderstood what they don't say what the penetration is for the Internet.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:13.200]   So they have almost 30,000 TV subs in in so Google fiber is in Stanford.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.680]   They're conducting a tribal trial in Connecticut in Kansas City, Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.600]   Provo, Utah.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.320]   Number one city Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.680]   They've been there the longest 20,000 subs then Kansas 7,000 subs goes down pretty quickly
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:34.840]   Provo, which is they've only been there for a couple of years, 2,507 and 194 users in
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.640]   Stanford.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.240]   But the penetration is not great.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:46.760]   Only 13% in Kansas City subscribed to the Google TV, 13% of the Google Internet subscribers.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.000]   I guess that's less I thought that was Google Internet.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.280]   No, that's not that's that's less interesting than I thought.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:59.800]   And if you're going to sign up for a wire cutting, no cable TV, who are you going to
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   sign up with?
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   He goes on up with Google, right?
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.600]   Well, if I had Google fiber, I'd sign up for their TV.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   Yeah, I would too.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.400]   But I guess only 10% did.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.040]   So why isn't it higher though?
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.880]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.880]   Is it not a good deal?
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.320]   Well, I think I think at first they didn't have all the channels that you know it was
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.920]   it was a roll out issue, I think.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.680]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.840]   Twitter, X is saying no AMC on Google fiber, no deal.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.840]   That makes sense.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.840]   You can't get madmen.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.640]   Don't want it.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.040]   You're going to keep your cable.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.200]   You also have to put down a three thousand three hundred dollar deposit.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:37.880]   It says Google fiber channel lineup in Kansas City.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.880]   Let's see.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.960]   Um, I can't tell what that's what would you call AMC entertainment?
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.440]   I don't know.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.680]   I'm a movie channel.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.040]   Sounds like I came it to me.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.480]   Yeah, I'm not seated here.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.440]   Does it have the hallmark channel?
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.360]   Oh boy, I'm just not up to that.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.120]   Jeez, treacle and trick.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.840]   Oh, that sounds like one of your reviews, treacle and trickle.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.360]   Well, in fact, homework got so mad at me when I was at the People magazine reviewing.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.120]   They pull well through heads with People magazine and believe me, people magazine had
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.160]   a lot of homework.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.660]   Wow.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.340]   What's wrong with you, Jeff?
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.000]   I'm just a, I'm just a growly bunch of.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.300]   Google code is shutting down.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.820]   This kind of saddens me.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:32.460]   According to one of the members of the team, when we started Google code, there was a real
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.460]   need for this.
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:34.460]   It was source forage and nothing.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:37.940]   He said this is really a risk, the open source community is at this great risk.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:40.580]   If source forage, I don't know what's going on.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.580]   Let me close this.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.100]   If source forage shuts down, you know, all these open source projects will be at a
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.100]   luck.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:50.260]   So they created Google code, but now he says, there's so many places you can create and
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.620]   host a open source project.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.740]   There's no need for Google code.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:02.020]   So there's GitHub, but that's a commercial project.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.100]   It launched in 2006.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.580]   So there'd be an alternative to source forage since then, quote, we've seen a wide variety
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:13.060]   of better project hosting services such as GitHub and Bitbucket Bloom.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:16.700]   Many projects moved away from Google code to those other systems to meet developers
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700]   where they are.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.500]   We ourselves migrated nearly a thousand of our own open source projects from Google
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.740]   code to GitHub.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.580]   That makes sense.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:32.500]   I mean, you know, there's no point in keeping it going if users are going somewhere else.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.740]   So there is a Google code to GitHub exporter tool.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:39.620]   Problem with GitHub is it's a for profit business, right?
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.020]   There's still somebody else hosting here.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.020]   True.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.020]   Stuff.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.540]   Well, so it's pretty cool though.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.540]   GitHub.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.540]   Have you been to their headquarters?
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.540]   I love GitHub.
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.540]   GitHub headquarters?
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.540]   No.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:55.260]   It's amazing because they have this world economic forum held an event there in San Francisco
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.060]   and it's something that they have a replica of the Oval Office as their as their efforts.
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.060]   You're kidding.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.060]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.060]   I've all this crazy stuff.
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:08.020]   They have a huge bar on the founders, you know, serve from it.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:11.460]   And there's hardly anybody working there because they're, you know, they're so they who
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.980]   better to be virtual and get right.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:17.300]   So they're all going to be like, oh, I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.040]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.540]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:23.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:24.980]   So I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:25.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:26.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:27.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:28.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:30.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:31.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:32.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:33.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:34.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:35.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:49.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:50.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:34.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:41.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:48.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:55.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:02.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:09.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:16.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:23.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:37.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:44.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:51.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:58.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:05.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:12.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:19.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:33.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:40.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:47.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:17:01.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:08.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:15.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:22.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:29.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:36.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:43.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:50.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:57.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:04.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:11.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:18.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:25.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:32.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:40.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:54.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.980]   It's true.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:10.980]   Google has decided to pay a little more attention to the app submissions in the Play Store.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.980]   Humans will now review.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.980]   This is an app-ily response.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:16.980]   I don't know what this means.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:23.980]   Apps and missions on Google Play now reviewed by staff and will include age-based ratings.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:27.980]   That has to be a huge new department.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:33.980]   What happened before they wouldn't put up malware in the App Store?
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:38.980]   How do they determine before just the basic standards they had, which were technological standards?
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.980]   They probably had some automated bounce-out.
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:53.980]   It was a security thing going on automatic security scanning for known potential threats.
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:58.980]   Then as the new ones would be discovered, they'd add to that.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:00.980]   Verify Apps runs on Android.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:04.980]   You can have that check every app installed and it compares it against that list.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:05.980]   This is something different.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.980]   It's actually been going on for two months now, undetected.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:16.980]   Google is just now announcing it, saying, "We've been doing it for two months and you guys haven't noticed yet."
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:21.980]   There's going to be E for everyone, G for general?
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:23.980]   Oh, yeah, the ratings right now.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.980]   It varies by region.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.980]   Is there a bar?
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   There's M for Mature.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   In the US, ET&M, which is just like gaming, everyone, teen, and Mature, other countries will do it the way they do whatever it is, games or movies.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:45.980]   I wonder if they were getting flack for kids installing things that weren't age-appropriate or?
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:46.980]   I don't know.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.980]   There isn't anything that sexy.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:56.980]   Google, just in general, as of late, has been paying a lot more attention to the kid angle of things.
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:02.980]   YouTube Kids restricted profiles in Android, all that kind of stuff.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.980]   I think this falls in line.
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:11.980]   They modeled this rating system for what I understand closely to the MSRB that already exists in video games.
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:12.980]   Yes, sorry.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:13.980]   Yes, R.B.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:14.980]   That's the video game race.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   Now, it does sound like it's somewhat up to the developer because they have a questionnaire the developer fills out and then they determine the rating based on that.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.980]   So it's still not heavily manual process.
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:39.980]   But I think there was just a published study about the freak exploit that showed that, you know, so what freak is, we talked about it in security now if you want to get all the details.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:52.980]   But the idea of freak is, it's a downgrade of encryption that a man in the middle attack enforced by sending certainly crafted packets so that when you have an encrypted connection, you can have really weak encryption.
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:58.980]   This was encryption that was created when the U.S. government 20 years ago banned export of encryption.
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:21:59.980]   Remember that?
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:04.980]   So they allowed 512-bit encryption, which is just no good.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.980]   It's greatly cracked.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:15.980]   And but most SSL suites apparently continue to support this very low grade encryption just in case they meet somebody that only can do it that way.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:16.980]   They shouldn't.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.980]   And operating systems are being patched.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:20.980]   Android has been patched.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.980]   iOS has been patched so that they no longer allow downgrade to that low a level.
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:35.980]   But if you're using an older version of Android or an older version of iOS and you install one of these malicious apps on your system, you could be vulnerable to getting freaked.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.980]   That would allow a bad guy to see all your encrypted traffic, including credit cards, passwords, so forth.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:54.980]   So FireEye, which is the security firm that did this research, came up with 1,999 titles that left users open to this encryption downgrade attack.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:56.980]   But this is the interesting thing.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.980]   1,228 were on Android.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.980]   771 were on iOS.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:05.980]   So it's not like I think a lot of times people think that I'm using an Apple.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.980]   I'm safe.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:10.980]   Not particularly, not a lot safer.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.980]   So the big takeaway is update your operating system.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:22.980]   Now that's easy with Apple because unless you have a fairly old device, you can easily go to the latest version of iOS.
[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.980]   8.2 has been patched against freak.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:30.980]   What version of Android? 5.02?
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.980]   Not sure when they patched it.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.980]   I'm not sure on that.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.980]   But that will leave out.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   I mean, my note 4 is still a KitKat, so that will leave some people out.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:49.980]   So be careful, I guess, about what apps you download and update your operating system as soon as you can.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:55.980]   To test if browsers are vulnerable, visit the SSL Labs page.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.980]   And it will tell you, freakattack.com.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.980]   Let me do that.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:06.980]   Everybody now, do that on your Android device, freakattack.com.
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.980]   Now I'm curious.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.980]   What's it going to do?
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.980]   Well, it won't do anything bad.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.980]   It'll just tell you if you're vulnerable.
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.980]   It will install the...
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:18.980]   It will attempt to...
[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:20.980]   Warning, your browser, okay.
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:21.980]   There you go.
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:23.980]   Your browser is vulnerable to the freak attack.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:27.980]   It can be tricked into using weak encryption if you visit a vulnerable website.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.980]   So you have to go...
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:33.980]   You have to have out of date's operating system or browser.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.980]   You have to visit a vulnerable website and you have to have software on your...
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.980]   Well, I guess this browser is vulnerable.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   I guess is what it's saying.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.980]   But doesn't your Chrome update itself automatically?
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.980]   I thought it did.
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.980]   Freakattack.com?
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.980]   Yes, I think it's the...
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.980]   What is your Nexus 6 say? It should be all right.
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:59.980]   Let me try it with the Samsung browser.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:03.980]   Good news, your browser appears to be safe from the freak attack.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:07.980]   So I think it's an LS-late level update.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:09.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:10.980]   Stop it.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.980]   I'm vulnerable.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.980]   You too.
[01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:13.980]   It's all vulnerable.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:14.980]   I'm so open.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:15.980]   So be careful.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:16.980]   Wow.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:20.980]   Popular sites that are susceptible to freak attack.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:21.980]   NPR.org.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:23.980]   Airtel.com.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.980]   MIT.edu.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:29.980]   Who put this site out?
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.980]   Twit by the way.
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.980]   Oh, this is good.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:33.980]   This is SSL Labs.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:34.980]   It's reliable.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   Yeah, the Samsung browser is also vulnerable.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:39.980]   So I'm happy to say Twit is not.
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.980]   Twit.tv and Tech.i Labs.com both have been updated for the vulnerability.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:45.980]   Who...
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.980]   Gigo.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.980]   Oh, no, sorry, Matthew, just joking.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:50.980]   What?
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.980]   On top of everything else, freak attack.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:55.980]   Who did this site?
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.980]   The one that I'm sending you to SSL Labs.
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:59.980]   It's a reliable...
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:00.980]   It is.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.980]   Yeah, it's a firm that does SSL testing.
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.980]   And wow, yeah, look at all of these.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:07.980]   Only count.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.980]   I just tested it on my Nexus 6 that I got yesterday.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:14.980]   And it's vulnerable, but I'm installing the Chrome update now.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.980]   So now I'm going to check it again and see what it's saying.
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:19.980]   Oh, so you've been before and after.
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:21.980]   So your credit card company came through.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:22.980]   I got you a new one.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.980]   Yes, and I finally received it.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:25.980]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:29.980]   Yeah, it's about time.
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:33.980]   Okay, so that's good to know.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.980]   The freak attack is possible when a vulnerable browser connects to a susceptible
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.980]   web server.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.980]   So the key is upgrade your browser.
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   But I'm updating right now.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:44.980]   Yeah, maybe I need update too.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:46.980]   Yeah, the update fixed it.
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:49.980]   Everybody using the Chrome beta or...
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:50.980]   I'm not in the Chrome beta.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:51.980]   You're on the main channel.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:52.980]   Main channel.
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.980]   Well, why isn't it going to come with the beta?
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   Why didn't I get an update?
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.980]   Actually, you know what?
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:03.980]   And if I very well may be in the beta actually, because if I did that, I probably did it a couple of years ago.
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:04.980]   At this point, I've just forgotten.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:05.980]   Who knows?
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.980]   But no, I mean, I checked before the update and I was vulnerable after the update.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:11.980]   I'm good.
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:12.980]   Cool.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:13.980]   If my Skype slows down, it's because I'm...
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:14.980]   I do.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.980]   I see a Chrome browser update.
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:21.980]   Lots of bug fixes is all they say, but I bet you that's exactly one of them.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.980]   So I'm going to update my browser and I'll let you know.
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.980]   So there you go.
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:30.980]   Interesting.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.980]   In the UK, there's a Google text.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.980]   There is indeed 25%.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.980]   What?
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   There's an everything.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:39.980]   What?
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:40.980]   I'm not exactly clear.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.980]   But yes, this is the political move.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.980]   It's the new budget and they've been threatening this.
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:47.980]   Google's all-oriented taxes.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.980]   Well, the law, they're doing what's legal.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:53.980]   So now they're going to say, well, we're going to tax you anyway.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:55.980]   What is the tax?
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.980]   It's a 25% tax on...
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.980]   How are they determining how much?
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:01.980]   To average profits.
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:02.980]   They're all out.
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:03.980]   They're still in that.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   This is to avoid the Dutch sandwich in the Irish...
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:08.980]   In the Irish, turn it over.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:09.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:10.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:16.980]   And once again, and the thing is if it's discriminatory, it aimed at only one or two companies.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   It's the year too big and make too much money tax.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:21.980]   You damn Yankees.
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:23.980]   Wow.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.980]   Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:31.980]   25% tax on the profits that's higher than the general 20% corporate tax.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:33.980]   And yeah, come on.
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:35.980]   It's discriminatory.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:41.980]   It's unclear how easy it will be to actually implement this tax.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:46.980]   And of course, how do they know?
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.980]   So it's not everybody that has to pay it?
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.980]   How can you legally do that?
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:52.980]   That seems...
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:55.980]   Just certain companies have to pay a higher tax.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.980]   All right, we're going to get out of here.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:58.980]   Oh, I'm fine.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.980]   You have a math yes to go.
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.980]   I don't want to live here.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.980]   Don't stop just for me.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.980]   Don't stop just for me.
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:08.980]   I will stop just for you.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.980]   No, actually we're done.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.980]   We've gone right through it.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:12.980]   We've gone through everything.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.980]   This was not a heavy week.
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.980]   I've got to say.
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.980]   Although Microsoft is developing...
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:20.980]   There's one more story.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:23.980]   Software that converts Android phones to Windows 10.
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:25.980]   Is that malware?
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.980]   Is that something...
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:27.980]   What is that?
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:29.980]   That's the definition of malware.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:32.980]   Is this something somebody would choose to do?
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.980]   Why would someone want that?
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:40.980]   It's testing Windows 10 with power users of the Me4,
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.980]   which is an Android smartphone.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:45.980]   The initiative which Xiaomi who makes the Me4
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.980]   stressed is not a partnership.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:50.980]   That's a nice clause.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.980]   So apparently you can...
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:57.980]   It over effectively overrides Android,
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:00.980]   turning the Xiaomi phone into a Windows 10 device
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.980]   complete with Microsoft services.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   What?
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.980]   This is a story from TechCrunch by John Russell.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.980]   What?
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:12.980]   The software does not offer a dual boot option.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   This is a ROM based on Windows that's like
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.980]   Cyanogen or some other ROM.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.980]   Wow, you could just put on your phone.
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:23.980]   Super great idea.
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.980]   What?
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:30.980]   That's one way to get people to make Windows phones.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.980]   So here's the latest...
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.980]   Here's an update from Microsoft.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   As part of the Windows Insider program,
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:37.980]   Microsoft will partner with Xiaomi to offer Windows 10
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.980]   free downloads to a select group of Me4 owners.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:44.980]   You will be able to flash your phones with the new Windows 10 OS
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.980]   and provide feedback.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:48.980]   So you're not getting the current version,
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:51.980]   you're getting the future version, which is fairly...
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:52.980]   It's a beta testing.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.980]   It's a beta testing on another platform.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:57.980]   It sounds like it's Xiaomi only, though, right?
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.980]   This headline implies more than just Xiaomi,
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.980]   but as far as I can tell, it's just the Me4.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:06.980]   Xiaomi says, "We're not a partner."
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:07.980]   But we're not a partner.
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:08.980]   I'll just let you know.
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:09.980]   What is it?
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.980]   Well, you know, what the hell.
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:12.980]   Why are you doing that?
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.980]   We liked that satya Nadella fella.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:16.980]   We thought, "All right, go ahead.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.980]   Knock yourself out."
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:20.980]   That's a surprise.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:22.980]   Well, what's of interest is that technically it's possible.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:25.980]   If it's possible, others will do it.
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:30.980]   It will be, you know, you'll get your new boot manager
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.980]   and, among other things in your Android phone,
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:35.980]   you've brewed it and installed a new recovery partition
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:37.980]   and, among other things, you'll say,
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.980]   "Okay, now you can install signage in mod 12 or Windows 10."
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.980]   Wow.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.980]   That's interesting.
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.980]   That it's even possible.
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.980]   Our show today brought to you by Linad.com.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.980]   Probably the guys who developed that were studying programming
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.980]   at Linad.com.
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:55.980]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:56.980]   Linad, actually, a lot of people,
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:59.980]   Linad.com is for anybody who wants to learn problem solvers.
[01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.980]   Maybe you're just curious, or maybe you want to get a better job.
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.980]   Take better photos.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.980]   Master Excel, build a website.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:08.980]   Boost your Photoshop skills.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:10.980]   At Linad, you can learn most anything.

[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:20.980]   On all of the tools everybody's using, for instance,
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.980]   if you want to learn how to write mobile software,
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:26.980]   there are courses on Android Studio, Essential Training.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.980]   That's neat.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:31.980]   That's the new IDE that Google's just started to give away.
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:34.980]   Swift Essentials Training, the new Apple Programming Language.
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.980]   There's also courses, well, there's one called Building a Note
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:38.980]   Taking to App for Android.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.980]   It'd be a great way to get started.
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:44.980]   Or iOS, or Windows Phone, where they teach you how to create a mobile
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.980]   app on each platform from start to finish.
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.980]   I love that.
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.980]   You can learn more about the Google App.

[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:23.980]   Create and save playlists, of course, as you want to watch.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:25.980]   Customize your learning path.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:29.980]   Lisa was doing Photoshop this morning at breakfast.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.980]   So cool.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.980]   Stay up to date.
[01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:35.980]   Linda.com works with software companies to prepare courses ahead of time.
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:37.980]   So they're available right when the new version ships.
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:38.980]   New layroom comes out.
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:39.980]   There's going to be a Linda course.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.980]   When the new logic pro 10 came out, man, immediately Linda courses.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:44.980]   Same with Photoshop.
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:47.980]   Same with Final Cut.
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:51.980]   Your Linda.com membership also gives you unlimited access to all the courses.
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:52.980]   So that's nice.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:55.980]   Whether you're looking to become an expert, you're passionate about a hobby.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:56.980]   You just want to learn something new.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:00.980]   Linda, LYNDA.com/twig, a free 10-day trial awaits.
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:05.980]   10 days, that's enough to really sample the wares and decide if this is something for you.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:06.980]   It's great.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:12.980]   Linda, LYNDA.com/twig, 10-day free trial awaits.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:20.980]   Matthew, at this time on the show, we'd like to offer a free tip or tool.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.980]   You don't have to, but if you have something.
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:28.980]   You know, I was given that some thought before the show, and this is probably going to come
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:34.980]   as not news to lots of people in the chat room and lots of viewers and listeners, but I got
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:35.980]   a Chromecast.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.980]   I think it was for Christmas.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:42.980]   And I just started using it a lot.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:48.980]   I played around with it, and I used the backdrop feature to show photos and whatnot, but I didn't
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:53.980]   find a sort of compelling use case other than my daughter trying to show me the latest funny
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.980]   YouTube video on the TV.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:03.980]   But I set up a Plex server, and now I'm basically just streaming Plex through the Chromecast.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:10.300]   So instead of the Plex server somewhere else, pull it up on my phone, Plex has Chromecast
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:13.740]   support built in through the Chromecast to the TV.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:14.740]   It's fantastic.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:17.780]   Take the Chromecast with me, throw it in a pocket.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:19.780]   You know, I'm in a hotel or somewhere.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:23.380]   Does it still remain in Chromecast to be on the same Wi-Fi as you?
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:24.380]   It does.
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.380]   It has to be, yes.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:30.940]   So the Wi-Fi, it works great in the house, but as long as you're--
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.940]   It tells.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.940]   I'm trying to think of whether I've actually used that on a hotel.
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.940]   The thing that they said they were going to-- I don't know if they've done it yet, where
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.940]   you wouldn't have to have access--
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:40.940]   Be on the same Wi-Fi?
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:41.940]   Yeah, they were talking about that.
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:46.140]   Yeah, so weird sound thing that they were doing that you would somehow-- I can't remember
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.140]   how it worked.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.140]   I don't know if that's coming out.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.640]   So maybe I wouldn't work in a hotel.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:50.640]   I haven't tried it now to tell.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:51.640]   You don't try that.
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:52.640]   And there's something else new about the Chromecast.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.640]   I'm excited about this.
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:54.640]   I'm excited about this.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:55.640]   Yeah, Yanko--
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:56.640]   Like the remote control thing.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.640]   Yeah, Yanko wrote about that.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.640]   Yanko decided I'm going to keep writing.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:00.640]   I don't care.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.600]   So he's writing on Medium.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.940]   This is an example of somebody-- am I saying his name right, by the way?
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:06.940]   Yanko.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:07.940]   Yanko.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:08.940]   Yep.
[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:09.940]   Rector's or Rector's?
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:10.940]   Rector's.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.940]   Rector's.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:12.940]   Former Gigo-ohm guy.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:13.940]   He decided I'm just going to write it on Medium.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:14.940]   Who cares?
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:17.540]   This is exactly what it would have been like if he'd written on Gigo-ohm.
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:18.540]   It's a great article.
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:19.840]   Nice job.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:25.660]   So because Chromecast supports something called CEC-- now your TV may use a different
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.660]   name for it.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.940]   I think my Samsung's call it any link.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:36.340]   But CEC is an extension of HDMI that lets you send control commands between your TV
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:37.500]   and an attached device.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:44.440]   So in my case, when I turn on my TV, it turns on my receiver using CEC, a vice versa.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.140]   It tells it, OK, you handle the audio, that kind of thing.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:55.240]   Well, it turns out in the latest firmware upgrade to Chromecast, 27946, support for CEC
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:57.900]   was added to the Chromecast.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.580]   Which means that you should try it.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:08.940]   But the TV remote you have already for maybe your Blu-ray or your TV might work with Chromecast.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:13.460]   Yeah, you should be able to switch to the Chromecast and it can switch inputs on your
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.380]   TV and start streaming.
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:19.860]   And you can press pause or play.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:23.220]   But your TV has to support it.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.980]   Your TV and your-- yeah, your remote have to work and so forth.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:29.380]   I haven't tried it yet, but that's fantastic.
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:36.500]   And Yanko got this from the Chromecast Reddit subreddit, Reddit R Chromecast.
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:42.420]   So actually a good place to go is to this subreddit ready to cast.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:45.380]   And they have a list of things that work and what people have been using.
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:49.940]   And works with my Samsung TV pause and play on BBC iPlayer's working.
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:53.580]   Bravia TV play and return seem to work.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.580]   Pause does not.
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:38:01.780]   It really has something to do with how it's implemented on your TV and so forth.
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:03.380]   So it's kind of cool.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.980]   So try it, I guess.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.380]   You can use your phone and your Android device is a remote, but it's nice to have a remote
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:13.260]   remote and they don't come with a Chromecast.
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:15.060]   Jeff, your number--
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:18.340]   I'm going to go with the number two.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.820]   A nice little-- Eric Schmidt told the story of South by Southwest.
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:23.780]   The Washington Post has the first person story of this.
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:28.340]   A Google Translate love story.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:33.300]   Two lovebirds met in Haiti, an American and a Frenchman.
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:38.500]   And he spoke no English, but they were attracted to each other.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.700]   And used Google Translate.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:41.700]   Wow.
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:44.420]   And finally moved in together again.
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.420]   Married.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:49.700]   When I was in Madrid last week, it was quite amazing that I was--
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:51.820]   I was sitting through these presentations in Spanish.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:55.340]   I didn't understand a word, but they had PowerPoint.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:01.060]   So I would point my Google Translate phone app at this PowerPoint screen.
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:07.620]   And it would translate from Spanish in English pretty damn well and incredibly fast.
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.620]   It's amazing.
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:12.620]   Before long, we're going to have simultaneous audio translation on Google Translate.
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:13.620]   I'll bet you.
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.380]   I hope that his voice lawyer has Google Translate.
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:19.340]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:21.180]   That was cynical.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.500]   He would get tiresome after a while going.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:24.740]   I love you.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:26.140]   I love you.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.340]   Damn.
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:27.980]   Judeam.
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:30.300]   Judeam.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:33.260]   That's-- so two is the number, two people?
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:33.780]   And so--
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.340]   You stole two of my other numbers, so I went on my hand.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.940]   Oh, I did.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:37.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:43.660]   I thought the cube of speed was interesting, but I didn't know what it meant.
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:44.660]   Two is good.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:45.660]   I like two.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:50.420]   So we showed you the Earth view extension from Google Maps that was really cool, that
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:56.180]   when you add a new tab to Google Chrome, a blank page, it would show you a random satellite
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.660]   view from Google Maps.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.860]   It was called Earth view, and I still recommend it.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:04.140]   It's free from Google, but they've released another one.
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:05.140]   That's cool, too.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:09.100]   Every time I had a tab, I'd have a neat satellite view.
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:16.740]   Now every time I have a new tab, I have a great work of art in all my new tabs.
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:17.740]   And it is.
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:21.180]   It's kind of fun, and it doesn't just have to be great works of art.
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:28.260]   This extension is the Google Cultural Institute, and you can choose what it is that shows
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:32.860]   up and how often it shows up and things like that.
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:33.860]   It's an extension.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:39.980]   It's a silly extension, but on the Chromebook, you can't rotate wallpapers and stuff, which
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:40.980]   I kind of miss.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:45.420]   I like the idea of having different desktop wallpapers, but this solves it because every
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:52.460]   time you do a new tab in Google Chrome, you get a new full screen thing.
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:54.100]   So let me show you.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.100]   There was the Earth view.
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:41:02.820]   I have to say, on Chromecast, the backdrop thing where you can show your photos, it mixes
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:09.180]   in my photos with Google photos, so art shows up and NASA photos show up.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:12.380]   And then you can just say, "Okay, Google, what's on my Chromecast?"
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.940]   And I'll tell you about the picture.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:15.940]   Isn't that nice?
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:18.580]   But you have to leave your TV on, which is kind of a drag.
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.140]   Yeah, you do.
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.420]   So this has some, it's called Google Art Project.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:28.420]   It's an extension for Chrome and it shows you what buttons are there and how often it
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:29.420]   changes.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:33.580]   The default is to change the artwork every day, but I decided to change it every tab.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.180]   I prefer that.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:36.780]   So it's kind of cool.
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.740]   Isn't that nice?
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:42.860]   If you like just having interesting backdrops, remember the days of screen savers?
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:45.380]   Yeah, it's kind of the opposite of a screen saver.
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:49.740]   You have to have your screen turned on for this to work.
[01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:53.140]   So that is a new Chrome extension.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:55.460]   So I'll give you both somebody saying in the chat room, "What's the other one?
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.820]   I like the satellite maps."
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:04.340]   So that one is called Earth View from Google Maps.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:08.540]   And you'll have to choose, I disabled that so I could use Google Art Project.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:13.620]   But if I get tired of that, I just disable Google Art Project, turn the Earth View back
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:19.700]   on, and now I get more satellite images, which is cool too.
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:22.060]   These are very beautiful.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:23.060]   It's just whether you like it.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.060]   It's cool.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:27.820]   Yeah, it's just, you know, because you have the same wallpaper all the time in a Chromebook,
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.620]   it's nice to have something different.
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:34.540]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition of this week in Google.
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:36.020]   With Andy Rooney.
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:37.020]   With Andy Rooney.
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.820]   A bunch of old farts.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.820]   Great to have you.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.820]   The three Andy's.
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:49.020]   Always a pleasure to find more at MatthewIngram.com, @MatthewEye on Twitter.
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:50.820]   We wish you the best.
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:51.940]   Come back soon.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:54.700]   And we'll set up a little thing.
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:56.820]   So we can help with the college fund.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:57.820]   Thanks.
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:58.820]   I appreciate it.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:00.820]   Yeah, I think that's only fair.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:04.820]   Jeff Jarvis, he's a professor of journalism at City University of New York.
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:07.220]   CUNY to be exact.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:09.060]   He also has written many books.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:11.500]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:15.420]   Geeks bearing gifts is his latest.
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:16.420]   Much must read.
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:19.820]   Going up chapter by chapter on Medium at geeks-bearing-gives.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:20.820]   Now that-
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:21.820]   Thanks for doing that.
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:26.420]   Yeah, I think, boy, you know, we had several medium stories today.
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:27.420]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:28.420]   I've started to think-
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:30.020]   It's not the great stuff on there.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:31.020]   Starting to think.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:35.060]   And it's interesting that Yanko decided to publish on Medium, at least in the interim.
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.060]   It's funny.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.060]   It's a great place.
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:41.300]   You know, if you don't, no one goes to your blog or you haven't, you know, you don't
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:44.020]   have one or you haven't sort of fixed it up.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:45.020]   Medium's right there.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:46.020]   It's super fast.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.620]   Writing is really easy.
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.660]   Lots of people see it.
