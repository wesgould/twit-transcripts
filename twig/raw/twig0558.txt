[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380]   It's time for Twink. Jeff Jarvis is here. Stacey Higginbotham's here where Jeff's got the new Pixel Buds.
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.580]   And boy does he have a major problem with those.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.040]   Governor Cuomo says Eric Schmidt should run our education in New York State.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.560]   I might disagree.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.660]   And we'll talk about PewDiePie's exclusive deal. It's all coming up next on Twink.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.920]   This week in Google has brought to you from Twits LastPass Studios.

[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.900]   Show where you cover the ladies from Google, the Googleverse.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.300]   Joining me with a plate of fava beans and a fine quianti.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.000]   Jeff Jarvis, Professor, Leonard Taap, Professor for journalistic invasion of the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   That's City University of New York. You like my mask.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200]   Oh, you're going to regret that that song recorded now.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   You feel like it looked like Hannibal Lecter and some of the names?
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   That's what I said.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.700]   Yes, but I think Stacy beat me with a better...
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   That's Stacy Higginbotham, Stacy on IoT.com and the Stacy IoT newsletter and the IoT podcast with Kevin Tofol.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.200]   Stacy thought I was wearing my Tidy Whiteys.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.700]   It does. It looks like Tidy Whiteys.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.700]   This is an Etsy mask.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.200]   I cannot take credit for this mask.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   You wouldn't want to.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   Well, you know what? It squishes you.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.700]   I'm working on a new design that doesn't squish your nose so much
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.700]   and combines the electrostatic properties of silk with the filtering properties of high thread count cotton.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.200]   And you're doing this on your own? Or are you going to a site to design it?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.700]   Oh, well, no, no. You get patterns.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.700]   But you can get a variety of patterns and then modify them.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   For instance, the pattern I was using had a third layer for filter.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   But I'm now increasingly of the belief that if I have the high thread count cotton and the silk,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700]   I don't need a filter layer.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.700]   And that really complicates not only the manufacturer, but the breathing and the washing.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   So the whole thing, it's better just to, if we can just get it to work.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   But anyway, hello.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.700]   Hello. Hello. Hello. Welcome back, Stacy. We missed you.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.700]   Glad to be back.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   It feels like there's less and less to talk about it.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700]   Maybe it's not that there's less to talk about.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   I'm less and less interested.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.700]   It's like it feels like I'm looking at the tech world to the wrong side of the binoculars.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   It's receding in its importance.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   But it's not. It's becoming more a part of our lives in every way.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.700]   And today, Governor Cuomo, America's governor, a pointed Eric Schmidt to a blue ribbon panel.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   It's so bizarre.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.700]   Yeah, it isn't.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   Last week, there was a story about how Eric Schmidt was becoming the primary liaison between the Department of Defense and Silicon Valley.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.700]   Yes, this rehabilitation or repositioning of Eric Schmidt is decidedly weird.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   I agree.
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   Is he going to run for president in like 10 years?
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   Oh, that's what this feels like.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   Like the toe into public service.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.700]   I want to see.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.700]   I want to see Schmidt versus Zuckerberg.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.700]   That'll be an interesting race.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.700]   Eric Schmidt, and for those who don't know, but I'm sure you all do, he was the adult supervision brought in by the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.700]   What's his name?
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.700]   Brynn.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   Brynn.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.700]   See, it's receding.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.700]   I'm telling you.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   And was the CEO of Google for a long time until Larry Page took this job back a few years ago saying we don't need adult supervision anymore.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.700]   And then of course, shortly after that, Larry Page said, "Oh, screw it."
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.700]   And he's gone.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   But Eric has been looking for stuff to do ever since.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.700]   He is a technical advisor to Alphabet, which sounds to me like just a stipend.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.700]   Just keep the money coming.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   And chair of the US Department of Defense, Defense's Defense Innovation Advisory Board.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   But he is now, he's got a job along with Bill Gates to help New York rebuild.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.700]   And he was controversial a few years ago because he was a co-owner, brought him into advise on education.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.700]   And people were scared of, "Oh my God, technology, computers and education."
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.700]   Well, that changed.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   Yeah, they are touring a school actually.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.700]   He said, Schmidt said today, "I respect Eric."
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.700]   I think Eric's very smart.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.700]   And he knows his stuff, and he's going to talk about telehealth and education and government services.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:44.700]   And what I want to see, because I want it to happen in New Jersey too, but I want to become Estonia.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.700]   Okay.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.700]   He wants the digital citizenship and digital passports and all of the services.
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.700]   Well, you don't have to be an historian to get that actually.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.700]   You can get that anywhere.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.700]   Yeah, you can.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   In Estonia.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.700]   I was glad I was.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   I was glad I was.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.700]   Because they had a bug which caused them to have to reissue all whatever, three million of them.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   Oh, no, really.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.700]   Yeah, that was a couple of years ago.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.700]   Yeah, there was a security flaw.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.700]   I was almost going to apply for it myself.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   And then what's the point?
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.700]   It doesn't get you the healthcare unfortunately.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.700]   It gets you everything with the good stuff.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.700]   So, here's where I think it's a good idea.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.700]   I don't know if Schmidt's the right guy or Bill Gates, the right guy.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.700]   I think it is a good idea during this pause to really think about what we could do better.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.700]   And if your New York state, absolutely, it's an opportunity.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   This is what he's supposed to do.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:43.700]   Re-think education, healthcare, the economy and the school system, the Bill and Melinda
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   Gates Foundation with technology.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.700]   Yeah, well, the presumption is with technology because it's Eric Schmidt.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.700]   Bill Gates Foundation chosen to revolutionize online learning for the fall and develop.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.700]   That's controversial because the Gates Foundation loves one view of education in common core
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.700]   curriculum.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.700]   It's a lot of common core and people don't like common core and it's very controversial.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.700]   Every teacher I talk to hates common core.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.700]   Part of that is because we don't give, I think it'd be fine if common core was like the base,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   but they don't have the time and the resources to go beyond that.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:29.700]   And common core really constrains them in the environment in which, like, if they had half the kids in the class
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.700]   and they had maybe more time in the classroom.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.700]   Does this fund it better?
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.700]   So Bill Gates in his annual letter earlier this year wrote, "When it comes to US education,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.700]   we're not seeing yet seeing the kind of bottom line impact we expected.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.700]   This is why you do not want a businessman to be planning your education.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.700]   You want an educator to do it.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.700]   Excuse me.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.700]   Pardon me.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   Right?
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.700]   Well, I mean, if the goal of education is just...
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.700]   But, okay.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.700]   He's not saying he's using bottom line, but is he actually talking about profit and loss?
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.700]   Or is he saying, "Look, our metric is to create citizens."
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.700]   I mean, because education is to create well-rounded critical thinkers who can participate in democracy.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.700]   Right?
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.700]   That's the old school version.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.700]   Right?
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.700]   And somewhat to prepare them for the job market and life ahead.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.700]   Well, and I think the ability to think critically is probably more important now and the ability to make decisions
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   is more important.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.700]   And right now, our education doesn't really reflect that.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.700]   And that's probably a big shock.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:41.700]   And the other problem, speaking to somebody in the lecture at a school, is this should be
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.700]   an opportunity for us to rethink our classes.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.700]   What is done outside of the class?
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   What is done in the classroom?
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.700]   Virtual and real?
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.700]   How do we offer support in kind of genius bars, which I've wanted to create for years?
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.700]   How do we do pre-learning, pre-classroom and all that?
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.700]   The problem right now is every teacher is saying, "The train's left the station.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.700]   I've got to figure it out right now."
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.700]   And all they're going to do is replicate.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.700]   So you do need something to consider from the side.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.700]   Does more technology help education?
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.700]   I have always felt like there are thogonal.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.700]   I mean, obviously with remote learning, you've got to have technology, but it's not going to be that way forever.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.700]   And I would hate to see what we're doing now be written in stone because, "Oh, well, as we've got to do,
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.700]   we're going to run education.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.700]   Let's just make that the permanent future."
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:36.700]   Well, but there is definitely value in saying and taking a look at what's happening in education right now with remote learning, saying, "This works.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.700]   This doesn't work.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.700]   This is where we've had challenges.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.700]   And this is how we can add it to."
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:51.700]   I think we're going to have to have some sort of remote learning, not just because of currently being quarantined,
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.700]   but also because we might not be able to travel as well.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.700]   So being able to communicate over a screen is going to become important.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.700]   Being comfortable with this.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.700]   Oh, go on, Jeff.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.700]   I was agreeing with you.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:05.700]   That's all.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.700]   I just said, "Good point."
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.700]   What just happened?
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:17.700]   Jasmine Gripper, Executive Director of the Public Education Advocacy Organization Alliance for Quality Education,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.700]   released a statement in response, "At present, we're available.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.700]   Technology is serving an essential purpose in providing some educational access for children to safely learn during this crisis.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:38.700]   But we cannot allow online education to supplant efforts to get them back into schools with teachers once the crisis passes."
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.700]   Well, the teachers, how at risk do you want to be?
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.700]   Well, no, once the crisis passes.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.700]   Oh, yeah, back in a long time.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.700]   It could literally be two years.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.700]   It'd be so sad to me if that's...
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.700]   I think that that is a substandard education.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   It depends.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:06.700]   I think it's a different experience, and I think you would have to augment that type of education in different ways.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:14.700]   So if you're always doing this, then you have to think about, "Okay, what are the outside experiences that you need to build for kids?"
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.700]   I have a little experience with this because our son has been on an online high school for the last year.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:27.700]   It's called Connections Academy. It's a public school. It's funded by the California State because it's a charter school.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.700]   His teachers are all online.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:37.700]   We have intentionally, Lisa, has intentionally supplemented it within-person tutors, obviously, until recently,
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.700]   and other social activities trying to make it a more well-rounded experience.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.700]   But I'll give you an example that happened today.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.700]   Michael wrote, "I thought a great paper about being a teenager during the COVID crisis."
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.700]   This was really good.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.700]   He did it with a tutor that he's been going to for a long time.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.700]   They have a good relationship with... they work together on it.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.700]   He submitted it to the online school, and the teacher said, "F, zero. You uploaded it wrong."
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.700]   Oh, that's just...
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.700]   Well, I get the same thing. You didn't follow the...
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.700]   He did, by the way. He did, right.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   He did, right.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.700]   But that has nothing to do with technology. It doesn't matter.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.700]   It's an a-hole teacher, period.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.700]   Yeah, but just gives a better opportunity to be in a hole.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.700]   No, it doesn't because they...
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.700]   No, it doesn't because they...
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.700]   She'd find ways to ding a mother in real life, too.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.700]   And I will say, I'm not a fan of this, but it does teach you a lot about...
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.700]   Life and general unfairness.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.700]   That's what Lisa did with it.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.700]   No, you're very right. It was a teaching moment, right?
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.700]   Lisa said, "You're going to have bosses and other teachers who are going to be like this.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.700]   This is how people are just...
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.700]   Or just filing your taxes.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.700]   Right.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.700]   Like, this is why you don't wait until the last minute to buy your taxes,
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.700]   because what if the website's down, it's not like you can call the company?
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.700]   He did do it right. We verified it. It was her, whatever her issue was.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.700]   Well, and then he just changed.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.700]   So here's an educational issue.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.700]   And argue.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.700]   Right.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.700]   So here's... I need your help on this.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.700]   Here's an educational issue we have with my school.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.700]   Talking with the dean just yesterday. Here you met.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.700]   So she's trying to figure out how to do distancing in the space.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.700]   Everybody has any kind of spaces doing that and what's acceptable and what's not.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.700]   And she said, "They can hit me as the bathrooms."
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.700]   And right. One issue is, can people be in the same time or not?
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.700]   We have... In the men's, we have two urinals and two stalls.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.700]   Should you be that close or not? That's one issue.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.700]   How do we have a single-lane system?
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.700]   But the second is cleaning the surfaces.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.700]   So when I was in Davos years ago, I think I showed this video on the...
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.700]   I can't find my video, but I showed a versions video on the show at the bottom of other where it belongs.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:51.700]   His video of a self-cleaning toilet seat.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:57.700]   Now, we need this and I can't figure out... I can't see anybody else doing the same thing.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   Are you going to get trouble for that video? It has no sound.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.700]   There we go.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.700]   We have them in San Francisco, but the whole room seals off.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.700]   It's a French...
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.700]   Yeah, that's a different thing.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.700]   The whole room seals off and the whole thing is disinfected.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.700]   All right. I mean, look, this is trivial.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:24.700]   The more important thing is, are we going to let this crisis change education?
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.700]   Jasmine Gripper also said, "Hurricane Katrina spelled the end of public schools
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.700]   in New Orleans, which never reopened after the storm."
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   That's not good.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.700]   Up to date...
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.700]   Well, that was because of physical destruction of them.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.700]   It's different. We have a neutron bomb that's come through here.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.700]   Up to date technology is an essential classroom tool,
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.700]   but it will never replace the face-to-face interactions and relationships with caring teachers
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.700]   that form the bedrock of a child's education.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.700]   No one is trying to say that it won't.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.700]   No one gets.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.700]   Well, I don't know. Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt might well be.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.700]   No, what they're trying to say is...
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.700]   You make better use of the tools available and we're still acting like it's 1540.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.700]   I'll tell you.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   No, no, no, no, no, no. What's wrong?
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   I was advisor to my kids' high school.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.700]   I was on the board of trustees, and it was a one-to-one high school
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.700]   where they gave laptops to every entering freshman.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.700]   But most of the good teachers said laptops closed when you entered the door,
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.700]   and it was about in an interaction.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.700]   And they thought I would be promoting all this new technology in the classroom.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   And I said, "No, no, no. There's nothing to replace."
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.700]   They don't know your contrarian self.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.700]   Well, there's just something to replace a teacher.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.700]   No one's saying that.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.700]   Okay, yeah. We're not saying that.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.700]   And I will say, so no one's replacing a teacher.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.700]   No one's saying that all remote learning is the best learning.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.700]   I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   But given the exigencies of the current time,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.700]   you just showing how I did your job.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.700]   Showing how to erudite I had?
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.700]   No.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.700]   Given what's going on, you have got kids they have to access remotely.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.700]   And how, one, how can they do that in a way that allows them to have an interaction?
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.700]   And I think my daughter's school has really done actually a very good job.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.700]   They have the kids come on for like a 15-minute lesson.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.700]   They break them up into groups on Zoom.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.700]   And the kids work together on projects and they meet again.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.700]   And the time is still allocated.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.700]   So they have to be working on their, you know, inside the Google Docs
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.700]   so people can talk to them and see them.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:40.700]   But it doesn't, there's no getting rid of a teacher.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.700]   And eventually they will hopefully go back to the teacher.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.700]   They may go back at weird times.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.700]   They may not all be in the same place at the same time because of social distancing.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.700]   But no one's saying like an AI is going to teach your kids via.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.700]   No, but I would say we should be really cautious at this moment when you get somebody like Bill Gates
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:05.700]   and Eric Schmidt forming you on what the future of education should look like.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.700]   That it is not going to be a hands-on experience.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.700]   Admittedly.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.700]   That's not true.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   No, the Google guys, Eric Schmidt may not have been.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.700]   But it's Sergei in.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.700]   But that's not on the board.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   They're not Sergei and Larry are not on the board.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.700]   But they were Montessori trained.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.700]   Yeah, but it's Eric Schmidt.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.700]   And they really.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.700]   No, but it's not them.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.700]   Yeah, but no, Eric, no.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.700]   So Leo, I'll give you an example.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   Right. So we waste classroom time.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   This is a graduate school.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.700]   But we waste classroom time right now saying this is how you use Final Cut.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.700]   Pick a tool, right?
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.700]   And hit this button.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.700]   Then hit that button.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.700]   Then do this.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.700]   So we're going to do our better taught.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.700]   Number one on video.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.700]   And there's tons of great things like Linda out there that teach that.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:53.700]   Number two, when I was toying with deanship some years ago, I wanted to create genius bars
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.700]   where the student can pick their means of learning.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.700]   Here's the outcome.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.700]   Here's what you need to learn.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.700]   Pick your means of learning.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.700]   Get help whenever you get stuck.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.700]   When you hit the outcome, then you can move ahead.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.700]   And then classroom time can be used at a much higher level.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.700]   I've taught these tools where you have 20 students in a classroom, 15 students in a classroom.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.700]   One person has a problem.
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.700]   Nobody else has that problem.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.700]   Everybody else waits while you deal with one student's problem, which you got to do.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.700]   But it means it's incredibly inefficient learning.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.700]   And the classroom lecture structure is not right for that.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:35.700]   So my point is hybrid learning, some things are better taught at your own speed, in your own way, with your own help.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.700]   Other things are best taught together.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.700]   And we've got to learn how to separate those things.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.700]   And this is an opportunity.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.700]   We're going to lose this opportunity.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:51.700]   In any respect, all I'm saying is I would far prefer to see educators in this conversation than tech executives.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.700]   Oh, they'll scream their way into it.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.700]   They better.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.700]   Yeah, they'll get there.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.700]   Because I don't think tech executives are very well equipped to teach to talk about education.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.700]   I think educators might give you another thing to be consulted on this, not tech executives.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.700]   So here's the other issue.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:10.700]   So we said, going into the fall, I'm not revealing anything, but I'm on a committee about justice at my school.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.700]   And I have long, cursed at Blackboard, and I won't use Blackboard.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.700]   Nobody in our faculty will use Blackboard.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.700]   But some teachers, now if you're distant, you need to have some standard structure to say, here are the assignments.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.700]   Here's where you put it.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.700]   Here's how you get the grade, if you graded.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700]   Dada, dada, dada.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.700]   Here's the syllabus.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.700]   So we kind of agreed, we got to pick one.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.700]   And there's lots of good options out there.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.700]   No time, the school already has a contract.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.700]   So, okay, it's Blackboard.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:45.700]   I would far prefer to have had some resource to say, here are the goals for a classroom learning management system.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.700]   And to have smart people say, here are some options for it.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.700]   But we didn't have any options because we just basically have one in the end.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.700]   It's the default.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.700]   So if they do their job well, they can present tools.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.700]   Now, if they all they do is sell us, you know, windows, that's not--
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.700]   I'm just sick of the fetishizing of billions.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:08.700]   Thinking that they somehow have some magic key to the way the world works.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.700]   So I was saying--
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.700]   And we've got to get the billionaires.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.700]   They got Michael Bloomberg in there.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.700]   They got Eric Schmidt in there.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.700]   They got Bill Gates in there.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.700]   He's been the mayor of New York.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.700]   So he's dealt with the teachers unions very notoriously.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.700]   Yeah, he's--
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.700]   He's--
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.700]   Bloomberg's going to be doing contact tracing.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.700]   I don't know if he has a whole lot of experience with contact tracing.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.700]   Okay, but Bill Gates has proven himself to be intellectually curious about far more than technology.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.700]   I agree.
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.700]   He funds a lot.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.700]   He funds a lot.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.700]   He funds a lot.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:44.700]   And so I think the key-- and I think this going forward just in general is people need to be--
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:53.700]   need to value creativity, curiosity, in a spirit of inquiry in a way that historically we haven't.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.700]   And we have to do this because the world is going to change very quickly.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.700]   So I agree.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.700]   I agree.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.700]   This is a huge opportunity.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.700]   And these are people who successfully mastered those--
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.700]   I think billionaires are warped personalities and should not be allowed in any public capacity.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.700]   Oh, you just sounded like-- like what's his name?
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.700]   No, they are.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.700]   You're honest.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.700]   They don't live in the real world.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.700]   They don't live in a normal world.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.700]   They have no experience with the normal world.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.700]   And if they did, it was many years ago.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.700]   And it does not somehow give them qualifications.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.700]   They just know how to make a lot of money.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   That is, to me, the worst qualification for any of this.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.700]   Welcome to my world when you go for funding.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.700]   Well, I understand that's a massive flaw.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.700]   Yeah, and then you get Jeffrey Epstein funding my team.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.700]   But the alternative is to tax the hell out of them, which sounds good.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.700]   But then it goes into government.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.700]   And I don't want Donald Trump making these decisions.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.700]   Sorry, Stacey.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.700]   I said to get back at that.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.700]   No, I was going to say people also listen when they call.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:22:01.700]   And I would say that both Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt and Mike Bloomberg even are very comfortable calling on people who are smarter than them and listening to them.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.700]   They respect knowledge.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   And I think we're seeing right now how detrimental it is when you don't have people in positions of authority or power who don't respect knowledge.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.700]   Is that a low bar?
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.700]   100% it is.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.700]   But even if they've made a lot of money, they still have that.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.700]   People with expertise in these areas be the leaders of these groups.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.700]   Sometimes people say terrible leaders.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.700]   Okay.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:35.700]   So the president's son-in-law and the stories in the Washington Post today and yesterday exactly proved your point.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.700]   Take a bunch of well-meaning amateurs.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.700]   I'm a growth hacker.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.700]   I know how to do this.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.700]   Right?
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.700]   And they screwed up the process royally.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.700]   So that's where you're right.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.700]   Yeah, I feel like it's a lesson we've learned.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.700]   There's such an opportunity here to really, it won't happen, I know.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   But to address all of the fractures in our society that this COVID has brought to the fore.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.700]   Income, inequality, underfunding of healthcare, underfunding of education.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.700]   There's all sorts of things that are coming up because this has put a spotlight on them.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.700]   To bring in billionaires to solve it seems like to bring a fire bug in to put out a fire.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.700]   So don't look at them as billionaires.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.700]   Look at them as business people.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.700]   And I think there is a value in someone having to make hard decisions.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:33.700]   Because every good CEO, not the crappy ones, but they have to take conflicting goals and priorities and figure out which direction to go.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:44.700]   So your experiences in listening to people who know what they're talking about who are advocating for their side and then saying, and then coming up with either a compromise or saying, nope, we're definitely doing this.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.700]   Right?
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:55.700]   So think about governments and you look at things like historical revolutions, what you've seen are people who maybe make it all the way and then can't do that.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:01.700]   They can't abandon maybe some of their goals to actually function in society.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:09.700]   So in some ways, a successful business band is our woman, let's just throw that out there, business person.
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.700]   Thank you.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:22.700]   So this is a way that is able to evaluate and make those tough choices, which is a skill set that we don't, we as an electorate as people as individuals hate to make tough choices.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.700]   But it's hard, but that's kind of one reason we're here.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:34.700]   Because we hate it so much that we'll just, instead of thinking about the nuances, we're like, ah, this tribe or this tribe.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.700]   And then we get nowhere.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.700]   Anyway.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:46.700]   Here's another piece to Stacy on the business piece, but I think you're right, then we're fetishizing to use the O's world right now, opening up, getting back to normal.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.700]   It's going to kill people.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:55.700]   What we should be doing is figuring out how to do as much business as possible, given the circumstances we have now.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.700]   And there's a lot of things we could be doing.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.700]   One point two is we also need to be looking at what the future is going to be like after this.
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:15.700]   I on this Gallup call today, they said they talked to one major insurance company that is going to tell every employee who does absolutely does not have to be in the office to not come back to the office until 2021.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.700]   They've already stretched out there.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.700]   You're going to see a lot of companies that are saying I'm reconsidering real estate.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.700]   In the short term, I've got to have fewer people in the space in the long term.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.700]   I don't need all this space.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.700]   I know one major company, I won't say which one, but one we talk about sometimes.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:41.700]   That has been surveying employees to say, "Hmm, if you didn't have to go to the office all the time, where would you live?"
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.700]   Right.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   And so we're going to change things pretty radically.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.700]   And for some people, it's not a bad thing.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.700]   I live out here in the Sylvan Woods.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.700]   Maybe I stay out here most days.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.700]   I was a stupid professor who went in every day.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.700]   Maybe that was dumb.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.700]   I don't know.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.700]   It could affect people's lives for the better or the long run, but there will be tools needed.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.700]   There will be structures needed.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.700]   And right now what we're doing is just saying, "This will all end pretty soon.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.700]   We don't know when."
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.700]   And then everything's going to be the way it was.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.700]   False.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.700]   Wrong.
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.700]   Not going to happen.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.700]   Life has changed for at least a decade.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.700]   And then by the time you've changed it that much, you're not going to go back.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.700]   So I think we need advice.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.180]   So is to the business people be the head of the committee, that's interesting.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.700]   Should it be instead a scientist?
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.500]   Should it instead be somebody else?
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   I don't know.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.500]   But should they be there?
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   I agree with Stacey.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.500]   I wonder.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.900]   I do wonder if work from home is going to become the status quo.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.260]   Why didn't we do that sooner since we've had the capability and it would save money on
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.660]   gas, travel, real estate control?
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.660]   Control.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:57.540]   And it is a risky thing to say, "Don't come into the office."
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.540]   Not everybody.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.220]   And again, what is it?
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.860]   60% of people so far are like, "I love it."
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.700]   And there are still 40% of people who are like, "I miss people."
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.100]   Well, a lot of, I mean, I think you do both, right?
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.100]   You might love it.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.300]   You might love the freedom, but you also get lonely.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.500]   I don't know how to ever have.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   It's hard to concentrate.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   All of that.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.500]   You know how to do it.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.300]   We're the wrong people to ask because we're introverts.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.500]   We work from home most of us.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.180]   You know, we're the wrong people to ask.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.180]   But I...
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.140]   But it's also some jobs can't be done remotely.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.460]   And that's worth talking about or thinking about.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.540]   And I also think as we go back, we've got some really interesting issues that are going
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:42.540]   to come up about who is responsible for enforcing things like social distancing or wearing masks
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:48.580]   in the office because we're going to have to set up these policies and people being
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:56.420]   people are going to violate them unwillingly or unknowingly or historically we've had pretty
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.740]   weak HR representation for people who are kind of problematic.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.740]   How many of them...
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:06.620]   Most big offices have a safety person, a designated safety person who's responsible.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.140]   That's just to get you to the stairs.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.140]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.100]   Well, and that's just a person who will report to someone.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.100]   Is it HR?
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.100]   Does your HR department...
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.980]   Your job is also to get you to the stairs is to...
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:19.980]   Yeah, a bit...
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.220]   That's the Porsche Slob who didn't...
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.620]   Who forgot to run away when they went around looking for a volunteer.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.460]   I think that guy has a job now for not only getting you to the stairs but getting you
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.460]   to wear your mask.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.020]   That person is going to be the bathroom monitor.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.340]   And literally make sure that there aren't too many people in the bathroom and literally
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.220]   make sure it's cleaned up.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.660]   And who's going to do that?
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.620]   Do you have to have somebody go in after every use?
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.620]   Remember what I never...
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.620]   What does this mean?
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.620]   No, no, no, Jeff.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.620]   There's stuff right now.
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.620]   So what happens is...
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.620]   Jeff is over.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.620]   You should be able to go into the bathroom and never touch this.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.620]   Of the bathroom.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.620]   It is a huge issue.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.380]   Like when you said that, I was like, "Crap, because you remember how...
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.100]   That's the one place we all come together."
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.820]   Well, not at the same time.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.820]   We all end up there.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   You call it...
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.820]   You call it...
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.820]   The other place is equally problematic.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.820]   Maybe more so is our company kitchen.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.900]   We told everybody there's no food there.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.740]   Take it all home if you want any of it.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.980]   That's... you're no longer to use the company kitchen because that's another place people
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.340]   congregate and leave germs.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.140]   You're going to have bigger break rooms where people can sit six feet apart.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.140]   Well, how do you do me?
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.740]   That was the weirdest thing when I went to the doctor's office.
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.740]   The elevators.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.540]   I hadn't thought about this, but elevators...
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.540]   Right.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.540]   They had little...
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.540]   Probably.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.540]   Only four people could get on an elevator at a time.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.540]   That's still to the other way.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.540]   Right.
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.540]   Face the corner.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.940]   We had little signs telling you to face them this way.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   Oh, please.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.860]   And you would stand at a corner and do this, but yeah, it was like...
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.420]   Our stairways were on the third and fourth floor of a building.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.300]   Our stairways we can't use.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.140]   And the Dean's going to fight hard for us to be able to use them again because otherwise
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.140]   the...
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.140]   Right now we wait forever for the elevators.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.140]   We cram in them.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.740]   I mean, if you were going to do this right, you'd rethink a lot of things.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.740]   Everything would be...
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.740]   Everything should be up in the air because...
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.780]   A, this is probably going to happen again in our lifetime.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.540]   And B, this is an opportunity to do it a little bit better, do it right to start over.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.540]   Yes.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.980]   Not that that's going to happen, but it is an opportunity.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.980]   It's an opportunity.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.900]   I have talked to people about Madam A in elevators, so you say Madam A...
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:23.900]   Don't touch a button.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.260]   Well, I bought those silly things on Instagram.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.260]   I haven't got it yet.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.260]   The brass...
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.260]   The knuckle...
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.260]   You did buy it.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.260]   Yeah, I bought two of them.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.260]   One for me, one for Lisa.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.500]   So you press the elevator button with...
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.980]   It's a little brass thingy, keep it on your keychain.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.780]   Or actually, what I'm going to do is keep it on my belt with one of those things that
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.780]   snipes you have.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.620]   Oh, the new definition of nerd, yeah.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.860]   You can open doors with it, you can push buttons with it.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.220]   You can wear it around your neck with your employee ID.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.220]   No, I know.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.220]   Why don't you...
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.220]   Because it's dirty, it's filthy.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.220]   Oh, I see right.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.220]   Okay, got it.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.220]   Keep it away from my face.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.460]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.340]   The hopeful thing is here's a chance to rethink everything.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.460]   Remember when Marissa Meyer took over his CEO at Yahoo, what's the first thing she did?
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.380]   All you guys working from home, you're coming in.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.380]   Right.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.380]   Right.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.540]   And that is very much a control thing.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.500]   You do have to learn how to work remotely.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.140]   And some jobs are better suited for it.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:26.060]   Like, I would have probably failed if I didn't have to turn in a story every two hours, right?
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.220]   So that got me in.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.700]   People on really long-term projects, you know, you're going to end up with people...
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:40.180]   The people who actually did their term papers over time as opposed to the night before.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.660]   You're one of them.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.660]   You would do your homework.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.660]   I'm not.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.580]   No, I'm a journalist core all the way...
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.580]   Like I don't work until the deadline is like...
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.580]   Me too.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   Me too.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.300]   I never always did my best work on deadline.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.780]   And then your editor is like, "Hey, what about that story?
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.780]   It's doing it hour."
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.140]   And you're like, "I'm just tweaking it for you."
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   Which means...
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.140]   I'm writing it now.
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.140]   I'm starting it right now.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.060]   Right now.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:07.460]   So I learned how to be, pardon me, for the sexism of this title, "Rereitnahan" on newspapers
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.100]   way back when we had that.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.140]   You had the headset phone on.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.100]   You'd get all the notes for the reporters in the field, and then you'd write.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.460]   Is that how you started?
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.980]   That's so cool.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   And so...
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.180]   Then we wrote on half books.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.380]   That's so front page of you.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.980]   Oh, it's very front page.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.820]   So we wrote on half books.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.820]   Is he his car right?
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.820]   I described this to you before.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.820]   It was a half sheet of paper.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.220]   And so you could put one paragraph on, and you had the whole bunch of carbons, carbon
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:41.060]   paper children made to make copies, and you typed the ice pick to get it on, and then
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.540]   you tear it out of the typewriter and you'd scream, "Cummy!"
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.140]   I just love that.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.460]   And some kid who's six months younger than me would come and trundle around and take
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.860]   the thingers around, right?
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.380]   So I was with the days, man.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.940]   The first paragraph was being type set as I'm writing this experiment.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.860]   We'll go through the process.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.460]   So I learned how to write facts.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.100]   There is a discipline today, yeah.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.100]   And there's very much this one about it.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.100]   Mistake free, right?
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.100]   You can't make a mistake.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.460]   So my first use of a computer, I was the only person in the Chicago Tribune who used
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.420]   them, was 1973.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.140]   That's how old I am, '74.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.220]   And they had computers in the early '70s?
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.220]   We did.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.220]   We were on the first.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.900]   I didn't know it was a SCAB system.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.900]   I taught the entire newsroom what a cursor was.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.900]   But it changed our role.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:36.820]   My point finally, finally, is my rewrite me said, "Write it all through!"
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.300]   And then take every minute you have to edit it.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   Right.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.220]   So it completely changed the way I thought and operated.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.980]   So yes, Stacy, I'm still tweaking.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.860]   I still think that's a better way to do it, though.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.860]   Write it all through.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.860]   And it is.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.860]   Go back, right?
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.860]   Now I'm trying to look at the book.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.820]   You can't get stuck on paragraph one for hours.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.260]   No, you can't get stuck on paragraph one if you're writing news.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.860]   You're writing one writes itself.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.860]   Oh, okay.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.660]   Who, when, where, why?
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:08.220]   Yeah, I'm like, unless you're doing a feature, which is a totally different style of writing.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.140]   I can spend hours on the lead alone.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.260]   I just like writing leads.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.180]   Oh, my God.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.180]   I wrote a lead to the other day.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.180]   You don't have a story.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.180]   You don't have a story.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.180]   I used to.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.500]   I used to have a journalism professor who would tell us that.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.260]   I wrote a lead the other day that had three cliches in one sentence.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.660]   Trying to set a record.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.860]   All unrelated, by the way.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:35.580]   Yeah, I had, I, it hurt me, but I had to cut them out.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.780]   Let's take a little break, come back.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:37.780]   There's lots more.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:42.260]   I am, I am honestly, something has happened to me over the last few days where I've lost
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.060]   the will to live.
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.100]   So I don't really care about any of this stuff.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.020]   So I'm going to let you guys pick the stories you want to talk about because I'm just, I'm
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.020]   fading away.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.140]   She is looking quite shocked and worried right now.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.300]   I'm fading away.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   I see.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   Okay.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.500]   If you can, you can help me.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.740]   Did you, did there was ever a point in your life where you just went, oh, I just turned
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.740]   old.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.740]   Yes.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.740]   Yes.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.380]   I went, I went straight from Wunderkint.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.380]   Old fart.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.380]   With nothing in between.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.380]   That happened on, that happened on Monday.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.380]   Well, maybe you're depressed and you should take a break.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.380]   Oh, definitely depressed.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.380]   I can't take a break.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.380]   I can't take a break.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.380]   I can't take a break.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:22.540]   You can come and host the show where Jason for a little bit.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.540]   Take a break.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.580]   No, no, I have to come and do my show.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.180]   This is what I was made to do.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.980]   I'm going to die in this chair.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.540]   Fortunately, I speak wings for my head.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:39.460]   Do the problem is you're saying you're angry and depressed, but you have happy voice broadcast.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.460]   That's my job.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.660]   I should always sound happy and smiley.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.180]   You know, you write the whole article before editing.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.220]   I smile the whole way through.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:53.820]   Let me just, this is a good time to take a break, even just for a week.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.220]   Just you can't find through this.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.220]   It doesn't change.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.420]   We're going to Germany in two weeks for the Oberham account festival.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.420]   Wow.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.820]   That might have something to do with it.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.820]   That's all off.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.820]   Yep.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.820]   Don't focus on that.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.820]   Focus.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.820]   Go find something to look forward to.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   It's not really that.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.820]   It's not a big deal.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.380]   The only issue is I look at these stories and I go, oh, who cares?
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.340]   It's less important than it used to be.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.340]   I'm just where I got.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.900]   I'm looking through the wrong end of the binoculars.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.900]   It's like, oh, Google, Australia, do you really care?
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:28.140]   Do you really resist the revised publisher code process in Australia?
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.700]   We should talk about it, I guess.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.900]   If you don't care, then people are not going to listen to your show.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.620]   We have to find things that matter to all of us.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   They don't care either.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.620]   They're just as to put the toilet in.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.620]   He didn't care about the toilet either.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.860]   I thought he'd get into the toilet.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   He didn't care.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.340]   He just dismissed it.
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.340]   He flicked it off.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.340]   I think he's about cleaning it off.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.340]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.340]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.340]   I care about Pixel Buds.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.340]   I care about...
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.420]   Oh, we're talking about that, folks.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.420]   You're talking about...
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.420]   I care about...
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.420]   Look, you got them already.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.420]   How'd you get them so fast?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   Oh, we're talking about that.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.420]   How'd you get them so fast?
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.420]   You're talking about that.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.420]   All right, now I'm excited.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.420]   It's something very shiny to talk about.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   Toys.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.420]   All right, see, stay tuned for toys.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   You have something to talk about.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.420]   Oh, wait, you haven't cared about my news.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.420]   Oh, that's right.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.420]   Oh, and Stacy.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.420]   Is that a tease or does that...
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.420]   No, no, say that.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   That's a tease.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.620]   She's got some very good news.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.980]   I'm trying to help Leo out since he's lost the will to live.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.220]   I have lost the will to live.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.860]   But Stacy is bringing a new life into the world.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.740]   So that's very exciting to all of us.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.740]   Oh, God, no, no.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.140]   Oh, that's not the news.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.140]   Never mind.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.140]   Sex.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.140]   Sex.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.620]   Turn the page as Paul Harvey would say, page two.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.100]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.540]   I do love my LastPass.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.820]   I love me some LastPass.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:44.580]   I've been setting up new computers recently, and I note new phones.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:50.180]   The first thing I do, it's the last pass because that is going to facilitate everything
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.260]   else I do in setting up the computer.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.220]   LastPass is more than just my personal password manager, though.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.140]   In fact, we use LastPass Enterprise at Twit.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:04.940]   And I am so glad we do because we have a lot of employees at home, almost all of them.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.140]   That's your remote workforce is now a big part of your business.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.620]   But the minute they go remote, they become a security risk.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.780]   They're no longer in the office.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   They're no longer protected by the office network.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.460]   Fortunately, with LastPass, the transition from in office to in home has been easy.
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.620]   LastPass lets our IT team still be the gatekeeper.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.380]   IT is in complete control over which employees are accessing which resources.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.380]   That's important.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.300]   Employees have, they have the keys to the kingdom.
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   They have the bank accounts.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:40.180]   They have the databases, the websites, everything we do, the employees have passwords and access
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.180]   to.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.900]   But LastPass keeps control.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.500]   We know who's doing what with what.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.940]   We've got unified visibility over both access and authentication.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.540]   We don't use a lot of SSO apps.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.660]   I wish we did because I love Single Sign-on.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:58.740]   LastPass has 1,200 plus Single Sign-on apps which make it better than passwords because
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.020]   it's just a click on the phone.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.500]   The employees love it and you'll love it because it's more secure.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.940]   I want to use more of them but we use so many custom apps.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.940]   We just don't have them.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.260]   But if you have that opportunity, man, that's great.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.500]   There's Amazon, there's Salesforce.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.260]   It's just so much easier.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.660]   They're also, of course, the best password management in the world effect.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:21.500]   The vault is so secure, decrypted only at device level, that I put everything in it.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.660]   LastPass doesn't have the keys.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.660]   LastPass can't see it.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.260]   Only I can see it so I put my passports.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.700]   Not that I'll ever need them again.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.420]   My Social Security number, I might be needing that.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.940]   Drivers license, everything's in LastPass.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.900]   Love LastPass.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:40.460]   Because your employees are going home, they may not have the same high quality bandwidth.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.460]   They have it work.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.740]   LastPass even offers an offline mode.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.900]   Both are password management and multi-factor authentication.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.980]   If their spotty Wi-Fi is getting away, they'll still have authentication.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.500]   They'll have access to their passwords and all the data in there.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.980]   As I said, we're putting so much valuable data in there.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.140]   Besides, just passwords, it's important.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.500]   Those secure notes are fantastic.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.020]   Makes it easy for your team to collaborate.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.580]   We're all doing Zoom calls.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.580]   We're all collaborating.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.940]   We're working on line LastPass lets remote employees securely share passwords across
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.620]   teams so they can stay on top of critical projects.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:21.940]   The average business, I just read this on the LastPass blog, has 185 shared folders.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.100]   That's crazy.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.740]   Businesses really need to consider implementing policies and tracking reports on shared password
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:28.740]   activity.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.420]   Make sure employees are operating securely.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.700]   You can do that with LastPass.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.940]   The IT department does not give up control.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.700]   You get seamless collaboration with coworkers.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:43.380]   It's easy for the workers, the employees, but you still have that security that you need.
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.760]   With all these phishing attacks, you'll be very glad to know LastPass never auto-fills
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.740]   passwords on suspicious websites.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.780]   If you've got employees using VPNs, as we do, LastPass adds an additional layer of security
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.940]   directly to your VPN through biometric multi-factor authentication.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:03.100]   We're going to do an event with LastPass just a couple of weeks, May 14th, not even two
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.100]   weeks.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.100]   We're on Thursday.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.100]   We come tomorrow.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.260]   1PM Pacific.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.980]   It's a presentation.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   We were going to do this in person.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.900]   Obviously, we'll be streaming, but that means you all get to see it.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.580]   Cyber security and identity trends unlocked.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:22.460]   I'll be moderating a panel, including Steve Gibson, the great Andrew Keene.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.460]   He is a hoot.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.340]   Gerald Bucelt, the CISO from LogMeIn.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.860]   It's Thursday, May 14th, 1PM Pacific.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.500]   You can watch our live panel at twit.tv/live, but it will also put it on our Twit events
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.900]   feed so you can watch later.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:40.380]   We're going to talk about this changing universe that we're in and how that's going to impact
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.340]   digital identity for businesses, for individuals.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.620]   It's going to be fascinating.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.780]   May 14th, a week from Thursday, twit.tv/live.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:53.900]   LastPass, thank you, LastPass for supporting everything we do here.
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.180]   You'll get simple security access across every access point with LastPass.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:04.220]   If you're not using it quick, go to lasspass.com/twit and find out how LastPass can help your
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.340]   business employees stay productive and secure.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.860]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.060]   Thank you, LastPass.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.900]   Here we are in the Twit, LastPass.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.740]   Yay, LastPass.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.900]   I'm setting up a studio at home when I'm going to bring a LastPass studio sign.
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.460]   I'm going to have the LastPass remote studio in my house.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.020]   Do you think you might start doing it from over?
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.740]   Let's say backup, but I have all...
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.580]   What's funny?
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.660]   What do we spend, John?
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.460]   Probably almost a million dollars on gear, on cameras, on tricasters.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.460]   I don't know.
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.460]   A ton of more than that.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.460]   Yeah, a lot of money.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.900]   I'm sorry, it's Jeff behind that, but it's expensive.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.300]   Nowadays, $300, I got an ATEM Mini.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.300]   It's so cheap.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.460]   I have a switcher, a hardware switcher.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.220]   I've got multiple cameras.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.420]   I'm going to bring some lights home.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.540]   By the way, the switcher, the ATEM Mini, I just found out has some of the best keying
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.940]   and has ultimate keying built into it.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.380]   So I could set up a green screen and you wouldn't know.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.500]   I might be there right now.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.820]   What room are you going to do it in?
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:11.700]   My den, my office, my home office is perfect for it.
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.340]   I took out some of the furniture.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.820]   I've ordered a work table that looks kind of steam-punky.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.500]   It's going to be great.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.420]   Got a fire, real fireplace in there as opposed to this.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.140]   I want cooking with Leo.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.220]   I want you to use your--
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.060]   I want you to make Stacey jealous using the thing.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.340]   Did you see what we did on our after hours on Friday?
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.380]   I wasn't involved because I thought it was too dangerous.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:41.140]   We did an Iron Chef cooking competition with Micah and Ant and Jason, Andy Inaco,
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:45.060]   and Mary Jo Foley were the judges, but it was all virtual.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:49.660]   If you haven't seen it, go to twit.tv or youtube.com/twit and see it.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.300]   It was hysterical.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:57.700]   Anthony Nielsen, who produces a lot of our most creative stuff, gave them three secret
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.980]   ingredients in a paper bag.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.700]   You ready for this?
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.700]   Snails.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.700]   No palitos.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.980]   What is that?
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.620]   Pickled cactus.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.020]   Pickled cactus.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.100]   It's prickly paracactus.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.860]   But in a jar and a dragon fruit.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.140]   And then there was inside that a surprise fourth ingredient.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.100]   Dried beef.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.100]   Jesus.
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.100]   Jesus.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:32.380]   You've got to get at least two of the ingredients to sort of work well together.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.740]   Well, we were having fun.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.340]   It was actually they got one hour.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:40.940]   And then Anthony, who was also a sadistic son of a gun, took like 20 minutes out just
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.620]   like in the middle saying, "We're going to be done soon."
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.660]   But everybody worked so hard.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.660]   Ant was great.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.220]   Ant had pork chops and his secret ingredient was like butter.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.540]   And he was like, "That was so great.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   It was so cool."
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.940]   What liquor did they all serve?
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.140]   Ant was doing whiskey.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:03.780]   Mary Jofoli was drinking a really interesting mango sour.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.900]   She likes the beer.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.300]   I think Jason might have had someone.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.260]   He had his two daughters, two young daughters helping him.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.940]   So maybe there wasn't any.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:19.180]   And I can't remember what Micah was drinking, but Micah set up a crane cam and like a table
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.180]   camera.
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.100]   It was so fun.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:27.660]   This week, Friday at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern time, we're going to do the match
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.660]   game.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:33.500]   It turns out Dick D. Bartolo, who we love and has been with us for since the beginning,
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.980]   almost 15 years.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.020]   But he's also been with Mad Magazine for more than 50 years.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:46.660]   But way back when Mark Goodson and Bill Toddman had a game show called The Match Game.
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:47.660]   And it was a...
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:48.660]   I remember it well.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.660]   Well, Stacy, have you ever heard of it?
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.180]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.180]   Gene Rayburn.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:46:00.860]   Well, but what you don't know is that the show was within inches of being canceled because
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.860]   it was terrible.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.900]   It wasn't interesting at all.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:10.780]   The idea of the match game is you have a panel of famous...
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.140]   No, I think it was...
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.140]   Yeah, and I think I...
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.180]   Did I have to get you to say the words?
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.180]   That was password.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.180]   That was password.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.180]   No, no, no.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.180]   Match game was...
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.180]   Oh, I can't remember.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.180]   Gene Rayburn with a long microphone.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.180]   You'd answer a question.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.180]   There'd be blags.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   Dumb dor...
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   It was so dumb.
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.180]   That's right.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.180]   How dumb was she?
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.380]   She thought a brick was a...
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.380]   Anyway.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:35.020]   So, but the reason it was almost canceled is because the questions weren't that interesting.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.020]   They were terrible.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.300]   They were just with a blank.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.020]   I had blank for breakfast today.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.020]   They...
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.940]   Dick said, "Look, let me write these questions.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.940]   I can make it funny."
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.940]   Here's the story.
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   It's really incredible.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:57.340]   He saved the match game by creating dumb dora and all of those sexy innuendo blank questions.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.340]   Dumb dor...
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.340]   He was even pressureless.
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.340]   Dumb dor...
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.580]   So, Dick saved that.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.060]   So, he still has original match game questions.
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.420]   He still is the best writer of match games.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.980]   So, we're going to do...
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.420]   Let Dick be the Gene Rayburn of our match game on Friday.
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.780]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.780]   4 p.m.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.580]   Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.580]   And I...
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.140]   Jeff, you've been on our after hours, but I don't think you have Stacy, have you?
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.900]   They're during Fika Friday.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.100]   Oh, that's right.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.020]   We talked about that last two weeks ago.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.020]   Fika Friday.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.940]   I did do an AMA that was not during Fika Friday.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.340]   Yeah, we've moved it to your...
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.340]   A bad time for you.
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.940]   Anyway, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.140]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.140]   That's great.
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.580]   See, I got excited about that.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.860]   Now, how did you get those pixel buds so fast?
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.860]   They just came.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.860]   They just came.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.980]   I ordered them as soon as they came up.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.980]   The only white.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.980]   The first pixel buds.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:55.540]   That's really an act of fate because the first pixel buds were god awful.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.540]   Right.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.940]   And I'm wanting something like this.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.140]   I still used the wired ones.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.140]   So, what's the report?
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.140]   So, they're...
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.140]   These are Bluetooth headphones.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.500]   They're kind of like Apple's AirPods.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.740]   They don't have that string anymore connecting them.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.420]   And they go the battery charging case, but they're big.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.420]   They're bigger and they go in.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.820]   So, those usual three rubber thingies at the end.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:18.820]   I need to take one.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.660]   I actually like that AirPods Pro do that now.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:21.660]   That makes it bigger.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.020]   It stays in the ear well.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.860]   And the base is better when they seal like that.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   Why is it...
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.860]   What?
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.660]   It was starting to play.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.820]   So I could walk with them.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:36.820]   I could do things with them.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.900]   They didn't fall out because my ears do not work with...
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.580]   By the way, the Google Voice Assistant is in them talking.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.780]   Yeah, if you hold down your finger, I'm getting a Fiona Apple actually.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:50.980]   Oh, I love the new album.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:51.980]   Do you love it?
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:52.980]   The new album.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.980]   Great.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:54.980]   Great.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:55.980]   Killer.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.980]   Better bring the bolt cutters.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.860]   It's like break out of the closet.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.260]   I love Fiona Apple.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.460]   So there's the good news.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   Right?
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.460]   They feel good.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.460]   They fit well.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.980]   They sound good.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:07.980]   So...
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:08.980]   And I put in the thing...
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.780]   There's a huge Reddit thread.
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.260]   If I'm sitting here using them, work fine.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.620]   Go outside, start walking.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.460]   For some strange reason, the sound will cut out.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.460]   In each one.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.460]   By...
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.460]   With no sense.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.940]   It's not a Bluetooth issue I'll bet.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.940]   There's something in it about how it's detecting in the ear or something.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.460]   I had the small rubber things at first.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:33.420]   I replaced them with the big so they'd seat firmly.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.340]   And I can walk for 10 minutes and it's fine.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.460]   And suddenly it starts going crazy.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.460]   It's not where the phone is.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.900]   I can move the phone anywhere.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.900]   It doesn't matter.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.500]   126 people on Reddit complaining of the same exact problem.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.100]   Now here's the weird thing.
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.100]   I don't think so.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.100]   I don't think so.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.100]   I don't think so.
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.100]   It's when you move.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.100]   I think it's your reaction.
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.100]   I think it is.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.500]   It's worse that it's gotten awful.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.500]   So they had me...
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.900]   I went on to Twitter and I'm very nice about it.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.860]   It'd be very nice.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.580]   I told them I was on the show today and I said if you can get me a solution before the show,
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.740]   it would be good, but they haven't.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.940]   So yeah, I think it was something about the fitting.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.540]   And if you walk...
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:19.580]   Not that it's not jostling or anything, but it just gets whacked out.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.580]   Here's the other weird thing.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.860]   There's probably there's nothing to do with it.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.900]   But if I cup my hand over the ear, I'm not touching it.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:27.900]   Just cupping it over.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.900]   The sound will go off.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.900]   Move it away.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.900]   The sound goes back on.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.100]   So it's ear detection.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.580]   Or you can be without the detection.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.900]   Do you have a metal hand?
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.900]   So...
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:40.900]   Actually...
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.940]   This is my portable Faraday cage.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.940]   Actually Stacey...
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.940]   Even the hand might be enough to...
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.980]   So that's probably separate.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:48.980]   That's probably nothing.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.980]   No, because when I...
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.460]   I mean, I have my jobers in.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.900]   They are Bluetooth, and that doesn't...
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.900]   If I cup my hands over my ears, it doesn't do anything.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.900]   It doesn't do that.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:56.900]   I have to...
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.140]   Because when I'm walking outside, sometimes I'm like...
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:03.820]   I really resent the tech companies pushed us to wireless headphones.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.140]   Google just as bad as Apple now, that you have to have a Bluetooth headphone for your
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:10.340]   Pixel 4, because I don't think Bluetooth's that good.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:18.980]   It's getting better and they updated the protocol just this last year to be better at
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:19.980]   audio codecs.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.980]   Yeah, they have.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:24.140]   They have new high quality...
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.660]   Besides aptX, there's something else new, right?
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.660]   Yes.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.660]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:32.580]   Yeah, so I...
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:33.580]   What are my options here?
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.580]   Hold on a second.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.580]   One second.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.580]   If you could come up with something...
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.900]   So there's adaptive sound, which was off, and adapts based on the...
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.660]   So there's a little microphone here, right, obviously for the phone.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.660]   So it would use that.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.660]   Maybe that's off already.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.660]   I have to say that...
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.780]   The original Google Buds were terrible.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:49.780]   They were so awful.
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.380]   Everybody had a problem.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.380]   Then there's in ear detection.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.380]   And I never fixed it, by the way.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.580]   So there's in ear detection.
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.220]   Well, they just abandoned it.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.220]   Yes.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.220]   That's one way to fix it.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.420]   That's why I was screw it.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:02.420]   But I turned that off.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.420]   I haven't gone back out.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.460]   The problem is I have to go out for a walk to find out whether they work or not.
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.420]   The last night I went out after I re-sided...
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.420]   I'm doing that every day.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.420]   It's good every day.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.420]   But I already did my walk.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   It's going to rain.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.420]   So I'm too depressed to walk.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.860]   So I just go to bed early and get up late.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.100]   I just drink.
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:24.180]   Why don't we schedule a walk or something and we'll get you out there?
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.180]   You're so clean.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:27.380]   That's very thoughtful of you.
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.380]   It's okay.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.820]   It's not your cross to bear.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.620]   I know, but man, you know...
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.100]   Hey, it's your high friend orbit.
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.740]   I've got to do something.
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.740]   Wow.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.700]   You think of me as a friend?
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.700]   Now I'm really touched.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.860]   I thought you hated my guts.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.860]   I don't hate your guts.
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.500]   You hesitate that part of me, but not all of me.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.380]   No, I'm very touched that you care enough to say snap out of a report.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.260]   I'm not trying to say snap out of it.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:00.780]   I'm trying to say that you are an important person who should not feel this way and let's
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.980]   try to get an inch in front of you.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.980]   Well, that's why I show up.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.980]   I show up.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:05.980]   They're weak.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:11.780]   Honestly, I think if I could just get a haircut, I think I feel so much better.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.780]   So are you thinking...
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:13.780]   Well, so I got a question for you.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.100]   I didn't get into...some people in chairman saying the same thing.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.060]   I feel like it's starting to get to us.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:24.100]   We are now in our sixth week of a shutdown more than that.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.700]   Sevens week of shutdown in the Bay Area.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.500]   It's starting to get to me.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.900]   But I don't want...at the same time, I don't want to go out there either.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:33.900]   So you're...
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.900]   No, no, no, no.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:35.900]   It's terrifying.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.900]   No, well, here's what's terrifying is that I honestly believe it's a year and a half more
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:39.900]   of this.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   I agree with you.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.340]   And there's no evidence there will be a vaccine.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.020]   There's no vaccine for HIV.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.540]   There's no vaccine for the common cold.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:52.300]   There's no vaccine for SARS or MERS, right?
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.860]   So there's no evidence that there'll be a vaccine.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:56.860]   But I don't...
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.820]   I mean, I don't want to depress anybody.
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.900]   So maybe there will be.
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:02.900]   You know...
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:03.900]   Even if...
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:09.700]   So if there is no vaccine, we are...people are resilient.
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:13.220]   We will come up with ways to do something.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.460]   It may not go completely back to you.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:19.460]   Some of us will move underground and the rest of you can get sick.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.460]   That's my plan.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.220]   I'm hanging with the billionaires.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.860]   I figured they've already started drilling.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.340]   By the way, what do you think Elon Musk these days?
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.340]   Speaking of...
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.340]   That's the...
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.700]   How do you say his child's name?
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.700]   You don't.
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.780]   No one has yet said.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.780]   Okay.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.780]   Grimes published a exegesis.
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.420]   The baby formerly known as.
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.340]   But you know what?
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.380]   I'm not going to hold them to the fire on this because it's very likely.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:51.060]   Certainly, I have friends, celebrity friends who would never reveal their kids' names
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.820]   because that's a bad thing to do.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:59.900]   So they tweeted that the baby's name was X and they deleted AEA-12.
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.940]   They also tweeted a post of the baby with face tats.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.940]   Those aren't real, don't worry.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.940]   Grimes has broken it down.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:12.380]   I love it that Elon had a baby and Grimes had a baby.
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.380]   Together they had a baby.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.100]   Elon has a lot of kids.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.460]   This is his fourth, I think.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.460]   He has twins.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:19.460]   It's like six.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.460]   Six?
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.460]   I thought he had five.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.780]   How many mates for that?
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.300]   I think the first were just with his first waa...
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.300]   Or maybe it was a...
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.620]   It was with a long-term wife.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.620]   Long-term wife.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:34.420]   Well, you know, I don't know.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.140]   Here's a picture of Grimes.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.340]   To give you some idea where this comes from.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:44.380]   When she tweeted, she says X, the first initial, is the unknown variable.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.380]   Thank you.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.660]   A.E. she says is her "elvin spelling" of A.I.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.260]   "Love and/or artificial intelligence."
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.300]   I is love in Chinese.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.780]   Oh, this is his seventh child.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:56.780]   Wow, seven.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   That seems like a lot.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.780]   But he doesn't have to raise any of them, so it's different for him.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.900]   Some people pointed out this it leaded A and E or sometimes called an ash.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.980]   An ash.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:07.980]   I thought maybe...
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:08.980]   No, I never knew that was called.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.420]   Maybe the kid's name is really ash and this is just a joke.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:18.020]   Because when they get to A-12, she says, "That's the precursor to the SR."
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:25.460]   She wrote 17, but she meant 71, which of course is the Blackbird stealth fighter.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.980]   She says, "Our favorite aircraft.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.900]   No weapons, no defenses, just speed.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.700]   Great in battle, but non-violent."
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:39.500]   Today is as a secondary value archangel, my favorite song, and X is metal rat.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   I don't know.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.500]   I don't know.
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:46.420]   Oh, Eline, his first child died.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.420]   Oh, sids.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:48.420]   Of sids at 10 weeks old.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   Oh, how hard?
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.420]   And they were all with us this first way.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   Oh, that's so sad.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.340]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.340]   That's got a little...
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.340]   He has five other sons.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.340]   Wow.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:57.740]   Twins and a set of triplets.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:58.740]   That's right.
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:56:59.740]   Triplets and twins.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:00.740]   That's right.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:01.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:07.660]   He also managed to cut $3 billion out of his personal fortune by his tweeting, "My stock's
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.140]   worth too much."
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.660]   That was just...
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   I mean, that's fine.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.660]   I don't care.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:16.660]   You know what?
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.660]   He's a billionaire.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.660]   He could do whatever he wants.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   Would you go to Morris with this man?
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.180]   I wouldn't even buy his car anymore.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.260]   Oh, I wouldn't even...
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:26.860]   This was actually a factor in my deciding not to own a New Tesla.
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:30.380]   I just don't know if I could trust that company.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.860]   They seem so strange.
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.620]   You don't trust any company these days.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.620]   Or billionaires.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.620]   I'm going to buy a store.
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.540]   I trust Ford.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.540]   Ford is a real company.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.140]   Have you decided what to buy next?
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.140]   Well, which...
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.900]   Do I ever use another car?
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.140]   Yeah, it's the Mustang Mach-E, the electric Mach.
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.140]   Right, okay, right.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   I have a deposit down on that.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.500]   But I also have a deposit down on a Model 3.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.020]   They keep calling me saying, "You want it?
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.020]   You want it?
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.020]   You want to buy it?
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.020]   You want to buy it?
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.460]   Yeah."
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:10.740]   We will any day now see the Apple Google coronavirus API on our phones.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:15.940]   Apple's already got it out in the beta of iOS 13.5.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.620]   Some people are already sharing pictures of it and so forth.
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:23.620]   They've released sample code.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.180]   Bruce Schneier wrote an interesting...
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:26.180]   I don't know if you...
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.820]   Do you guys know who Bruce Schneier is?
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:28.820]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.820]   Security expert, yeah.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:39.860]   I, of all the people in the world, besides Steve Gibson, I really respect and trust Schneier.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:42.940]   He says, "Doesn't matter."
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.260]   It doesn't matter.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:49.140]   He says, "This is his post, Me on COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps."
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.060]   My problem with contact tracing apps is they have absolutely no value.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.420]   I'm not even talking about the privacy concerns.
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.540]   I mean, the efficacy.
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.500]   Does anybody think this will do something useful?
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.140]   It's just something governments want to do for the hell of it.
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:10.020]   To me, it's just techies doing techy things because they don't know what else to do.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:16.100]   He says, "There are two big problems, false positives and false negatives.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:20.940]   The end result, I won't go into the details, but he does a pretty good job of saying why
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.660]   this is senseless.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.300]   The end result is an app that doesn't work.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.220]   People will post their bad experiences on social media.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.500]   People will read those posts, realize the app is not to be trusted.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:34.140]   The loss of trust is even worse than having no app at all.
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:39.340]   The idea that contact tracing can be done with an app and not human health professionals
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.740]   is just plain.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:44.580]   No one's saying it would be done without human health professionals.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:49.860]   Everyone says you must have the human health professionals in Legion.
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:55.420]   The question is, does finding out you were...
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:56.420]   Depends on what you were doing.
[00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:00.060]   In the store and you found out you were near somebody who had it, it's meaningless to you.
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.060]   But if you went to...
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.980]   A friend of mine has to go to a funeral.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.940]   If you find out two weeks later that the people there have it, then yeah, that's going to
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.940]   be useful to know.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.940]   That's not the impression we're going to get from the tracing app, by the way.
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.260]   The only information you're going to get because of the way Google and Apple have figured
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.820]   this out is you'll get a notification saying, "At some point, you were near somebody who
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.900]   had it.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.420]   You now need to quarantine for two weeks."
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.500]   As Shania points out, because of the Bluetooth technology, you don't know if you were on
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500]   the other side of the wall from that person.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.940]   Every New Yorker is going to be getting a message all the time.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:37.500]   And so after a while, people are going to say, "Look, I've been told to quarantine for
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500]   the rest of my life.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   I'm not going to do it because this isn't useful because they're actually not going to
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   tell you anybody's name."
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.140]   I said this like four weeks ago.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.140]   I just wanted to...
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.140]   You were right.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.140]   You were right.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:55.140]   I talked about false positives and signal strength and how you wore it.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.140]   That's right.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.140]   How long you've been around for the money.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.140]   You did.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.140]   Anyway.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.140]   You did.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.860]   When you came out, we kind of deferred it to perhaps that Apple had thought about this
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.820]   and come up with some way of measuring the strength.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.500]   You were talking about the strength of the signal and stuff.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500]   And time.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.300]   But apparently Apple hasn't.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.380]   It's not going to be.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.300]   It's a very typical...
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.260]   This is kind of what I was talking about with Eric Schmidt.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:28.020]   In-valley solution, but doesn't come from a real world point of view.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:33.220]   In Silicon Valley, we think the technology can solve everything.
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.820]   So there is value for some of this in some places.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:39.260]   New York, maybe not more remote kind of areas, maybe.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.260]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.260]   That's good.
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.260]   But yeah, here at my table.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.980]   Again, it's technology.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:50.020]   When you understand how a tool works, you can design something that fits that tool.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:56.060]   So it's possible that you could algorithmically try to figure out time and signal strength
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.060]   and variability.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:03.100]   But yeah, I'm just going to say that I am glad that this is now happening a couple
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.100]   of weeks later.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.860]   I want to be somebody who you can listen to.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.300]   You were on...
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, forget I mentioned Bruce Schnier.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.460]   Stacey's been saying it for weeks.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.460]   No, he's good.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:20.620]   Now confirmed by Bruce Schnier and the Brookings Institution, all of whom have raved exactly
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.580]   the issues you raised right from day one.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.580]   And the intercept...
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.460]   The intercept, the intercept, Taddis, they talked to the founders of Bluetooth who also
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.460]   said the same thing.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.460]   It's like, "Oh, right."
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.260]   And because of the privacy finishes...
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.460]   It is now a fetishism to want privacy.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.460]   Wait till I finish.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.460]   Wait till I finish.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.460]   Wait till I finish.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.660]   As a result, there's going to be no effort to have aggregated data.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.660]   Right.
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:48.140]   And so that might be useful, at least at an aggregate level, for government to know whose
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:52.220]   behavior and who's not, where hotspots open up and that kind of stuff, but they're not
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.220]   going to have it.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.220]   A lot of governments...
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.740]   Well, Australia wrote a similar app, not using the Google Apple API, because they wanted
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.980]   the information.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.740]   But their app has to run in the foreground, kills your battery, and you have to enter
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.740]   your location.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.420]   So the whole thing...
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.860]   The problem is the same thing with the Singapore app.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.260]   25% adoption rate.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.260]   Nobody...
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.260]   It's...
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260]   So you need humans.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.260]   And you need to have traces going out and doing that.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.260]   But you're absolutely good.
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.860]   Are we hiring a lot of them?
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.860]   Is this in process?
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.860]   Yeah, there's 100,000 people who have applied in New York.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.860]   Okay.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.860]   Washington, D.C., is hiring them, too.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.460]   But I was going to say you also need trust in the agencies implementing this and gathering
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:28.760]   the information.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:36.140]   So right now, like, do I want to give Donald Trump's administration as a journalist, my
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.780]   location all the time?
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   No.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.780]   No.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.780]   You'd fall out of the window.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.300]   What I was trying to make is that that's the way it would be useful, but that nobody's
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.300]   going to do that.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.300]   So...
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.980]   And then this same people don't have trust in Apple and Google.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:56.900]   So again, I'm going to go all the way back, back and say, "This is why we need to develop...
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.940]   We need to think privacy issues ahead of time when we connect things to the internet and
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.780]   start touting all of this.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:08.340]   And we also need to build regulations that make sense and that people can trust in.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.900]   Else, we can't do any of this."
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:12.900]   So that's it.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:17.300]   Speaking of Australia, yeah.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.980]   This is when I get depressed and I say, "I don't care."
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.980]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:33.660]   Australia has decided that Google is making money by putting snippets from Australian news
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:42.900]   publishers in Google search and news.google.com and they're going to have to start ponying
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.380]   up or stop doing it.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:52.300]   This is very Murdoch and it means that Google will pull Google news out of Australia, I
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.300]   predict.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:59.260]   Google said it's like charging the news agency for putting the broad sheet up in the window
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.100]   as you walk by.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.900]   So you can say, "Oh, I should buy that paper.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900]   That's an interest.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.900]   I want to read that story.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.620]   That's all they're doing."
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:12.420]   They say in their blog post, they drive huge amounts of traffic to news.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:18.500]   So it's 24 billion times a month globally.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.580]   Publishers want to be found by new users.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:29.300]   They want the traffic, but we don't have ads on Google news and we don't think we should
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.100]   pay them any money for access to this.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.100]   You're right.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:39.300]   So in the bottom of the official Google Australia blog, next steps, the government's response
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.020]   to the digital platforms inquiry acknowledged the substantial two-way value exchange between
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.660]   news media businesses and digital platforms.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:52.740]   We've worked closely and constructively with news media businesses, the ACCC and the government.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.740]   No, they haven't.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.740]   No, they haven't.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:55.740]   No.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.740]   They just are.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.060]   I'm just trying to assure we could continue to support publishers.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.060]   This is meaningless.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.860]   This is anodyne boilerplate.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.860]   If I ever saw it.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:10.180]   So yeah, France is screaming that they're going to, yeah, we don't care.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.660]   We're just giving it up in life.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.660]   That's it.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:13.660]   Australia did it.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.660]   It was over the edge.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.660]   I'm laughing at the idea of an anodyne boilerplate now.
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.180]   Like, oh, what color is anodyne?
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:25.340]   That's the name of my new band, my new punk rock band, the internet boilerplate.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:30.340]   Google is like a poster in the news agent windows for publishers.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.340]   This is from the Guardian.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.940]   Oh, it's like, is that Jeff?
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.620]   No, it does sound like Jeff.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.300]   Jeff's the other person who knows what a news agent is.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.300]   Actually in England, they do know that.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.300]   They don't exist anymore.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.300]   They do know that.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300]   Yeah, they used to.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.620]   But he asks in Europe, he asks.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.140]   They don't have news stand type magazine sales things on New York Street.
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:49.140]   It's all gone.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.140]   Not anymore.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.140]   No, it's all gone.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.820]   In fact, Stacy, here's the amazing thing.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.340]   They do have news stands.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.140]   Who the F designed them is beyond me.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:01.860]   The only place you can put the newspapers is on a shelf, right?
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.020]   Where it's got a shelf on top of it and no one can read the headlines.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.820]   Rupert Murdoch designed that to protect his intellectual property.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.380]   It's about the it's about those to have.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:15.860]   In fact, even with the the mechanical newspaper boxes, they put the front page.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.260]   You cannot see the front page.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:21.820]   I had never see the front page of the daily news or the New York Post at all anymore.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.820]   Never.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   Never.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:29.300]   And if you try to go out and buy a newspaper, a lot of those news stands have stopped selling
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.300]   newspapers.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.380]   Do you think Google will pull out of Australia?
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.540]   I mean, is that really what they put on a Spain?
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:36.540]   Yeah.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.700]   They threatened to pull out of all of Europe.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.420]   Yeah, I'm not that's not inside information.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.340]   Not that many people in Australia.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.940]   What's Australia's population?
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:45.140]   It's a school will lose.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.140]   It's a million.
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.140]   I don't know.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.140]   It's Google News.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.340]   It's fine to have the other one.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.340]   It's not just Google News.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.340]   It's a Google News pull up.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.860]   The other thing they would do is in search, fine, we won't do your snippet.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.300]   We'll tell you, you know, this paper has something and you're probably going to get a paywall
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.300]   when you get it.
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.500]   So, you know, click at your own risk sucker.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:07.940]   But yeah, there's there's 25 million people in Australia.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.180]   I bet you have the world to be each other at a given time.
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.180]   I did.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.620]   I asked my my nifty little goo, my G assistant that is right next to me.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:18.420]   How about a people are in Australia?
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   64.99 million.
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.420]   Yes.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.420]   Oh, you googled it too.
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   Yes, I did.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.420]   Hey, PewDiePie.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:29.420]   How many millions of dollars do PewDiePie get?
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.780]   Speaking of things to be sick.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:38.180]   To sign an exclusive YouTube live streaming deal, Felix Kielberg, the prankster and video
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:45.060]   game blogger betting on the fans as PewDiePie, has amassed more than 104 million subscribers
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:51.180]   and generated over 25 billion views to date.
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:55.780]   He apparently was making noise about going somewhere else, I guess.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.300]   Remember YouTube ended his reign.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:05.020]   Their business deals three years ago over anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi imagery.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.380]   He apologized.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:14.980]   He gave money to the anti-defamation league and then said, "Ah, that was a mistake."
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.180]   This does not speak well of YouTube's character.
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:18.180]   Yes, he is.
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.500]   He came back to this.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:24.300]   He was the most viewed YouTube creator for a billion video views.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.620]   This is them acting in concert with their financial interest.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.620]   I know.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:30.620]   I know.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:31.620]   But yeah.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.020]   What do you think though?
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.060]   I probably gave millions of dollars, right?
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.300]   Well, they probably gave me a guarantee.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   But Google does.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.100]   That's still like engagement.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:44.660]   They're like, "Hey, people sit and spend time with this even though we think it's
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:46.180]   I assume they think it's crap.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.180]   I don't know.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.980]   We don't love this person."
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.420]   Jeff, you've always been pains to say.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.180]   We shouldn't judge what people want to watch.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.180]   The content of YouTube is apparently very popular with certain people.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:02.020]   I just think that he's, do you want to put your brand right next to him?
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.860]   Interlocking arms?
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.860]   Some people do.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:12.820]   I will say with young people, maybe they mature and they'll mature relatively quickly.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:18.980]   I do try to give people who are young the benefit of the doubt because we do stupid
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.980]   things when we're young.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.460]   We do stupid things when we're old too.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.940]   They say we keep doing them.
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:24.940]   We keep doing them.
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:25.940]   Right, Leo?
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:26.940]   I don't know.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:27.940]   I don't care.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:28.940]   I mean, some of the things I've wanted.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:29.940]   I mean, some of the things I've wanted.
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.940]   I mean, some of the things I've wanted.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   Now, old people.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940]   We wish to do them.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940]   I heard 4 million subscribers.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.220]   You want to watch some of you PewDiePie?
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.220]   So we sure...
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.220]   No, let's not.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.220]   No.
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.220]   No.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.220]   This is not worth getting our stream taken down.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.620]   There he is, PewDiePie.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.580]   I won't play the sound.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.460]   He says, "Don't ever call me a Karen."
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:53.780]   So Karen, apparently, I didn't know this until recently is what some people call white
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.780]   women is Karen.
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:11:04.380]   It's white, middle-aged women who are unaware of their privilege and wave it everywhere.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:09.300]   So let me speak to your manager as the quintessential Karen phrase.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.300]   Yeah, okay.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:14.540]   That's the woman in front of you at the Botox doctor.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:22.940]   However, I will say it can be used to police women because the meme is so insidious and
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.420]   they'll be like, "Oh, you're a Karen."
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.340]   And I'm like, "No, I am not a Karen."
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.340]   That's what he's saying.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.420]   He's saying the Karen meme has gone too far.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.420]   Stop it now.
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.220]   Well, this is the woke PewDiePie?
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.980]   You know, I think PewDiePie just, I mean, clearly...
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.620]   I haven't watched him in years.
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.180]   He doesn't care anymore.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.220]   He's sitting in pajamas on the floor.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.220]   He's not...
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.220]   It's like...
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.220]   But he's...
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.220]   This has...
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   This was put up yesterday.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.220]   No, today.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:55.820]   And it's already got 643,000 views.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.620]   Here's...
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:02.180]   You know, look, I read Mad Magazine when I was a kid and probably the same old farts
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:05.980]   that I am today then said, "Oh, it's going to rot your brain.
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.220]   You shouldn't eat Mad Magazine."
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:15.580]   And I admit, my entire cultural, you know, foundation came from Mad Magazine.
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:20.380]   My understanding of humor and the world and all of that came from Mad Magazine.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.820]   That's absolutely true.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:26.300]   And so I imagine there's a whole generation, including our son, Michael, who's 17, and
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.660]   I asked him the other day, "You still watch PewDiePie?"
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.100]   I said, "Yeah, sometimes."
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.620]   He watches a YouTube video almost non-stop.
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.740]   Even when he's gaming, he's got YouTube going in the background.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:37.740]   Yes.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.740]   So it's always on.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:44.180]   And I'm sure that his cultural understanding of society and everything comes from YouTube.
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:45.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.660]   And so I think...
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.660]   Hey, are you watching this?
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.660]   Oh, sorry.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.660]   I was good.
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:50.660]   Are you all watching SGN?
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:51.660]   Stephen Chris is the...
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:52.660]   Isn't that great?
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.660]   John Chris is an excuse.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.660]   He isn't he awesome?
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.660]   Yes.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:01.020]   He got a couple of billionaires to surprise graduates with sage advice.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:04.860]   Oprah, Stephen Spielberg.
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.100]   His graduates aren't getting a graduation, right?
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.100]   Poor graduates.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.180]   Oh, no, everybody's trying to do this.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.180]   YouTube's doing it.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.180]   Facebook's doing it.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.180]   John's doing it.
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.540]   Okay, but before he...
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.980]   Before last the episode prior, he got all of these...
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:24.380]   He asked for recipes from people who watched the show, and he got Momofuga David Chang,
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.220]   Guy Fieri, and someone else to cook.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.220]   To make them.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.220]   Wow.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.220]   To make the recipes.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.740]   And then he donated $3 million to Guy Fieri's...
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.820]   Or he had Pepsi, rather, donate $3 million to Guy Fieri's phone.
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:35.820]   For workers.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.060]   And it was very touching.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:45.860]   I mean, I don't love Guy Fieri, you know, but watching him get that news and just reacting.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.860]   And just...
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860]   He was a...
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   People being nice to each other.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860]   He was a parent.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860]   We don't have enough of that.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.100]   He was a parent at my kid's high school, and I really don't love Guy Fieri, but that's
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.100]   a story.
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.100]   I shall keep to myself.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.100]   I'm feeling.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.420]   But you know what?
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:00.780]   He's beloved on TV.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.780]   He's a great TV host.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:07.020]   And he makes that hamburger look good every single time he bites into it.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.020]   No, I like...
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.020]   I don't understand exactly what's going on with some good news.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.020]   Like this could own...
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.020]   This is YouTube, right?
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.260]   He's got multi-million followers in just a few weeks.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.300]   It's very entertaining.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.780]   It looks low production.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.860]   It's obviously very, very high production.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.100]   I don't know.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:25.100]   They're putting...
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.180]   I'm sure tons of money into it.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.300]   It's my guess that I said this before.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.340]   His management team has decided it's time to really put...
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:36.980]   John Krasinski in front of the American public, because he needs a late night show, and the
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.180]   Jack Ryan thing is only iffy.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:43.660]   So it's my guess that this is really a career play.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:46.380]   Yeah, but it's a good thing.
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:47.380]   What a personal play.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:48.380]   It's a career play.
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:49.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.780]   And it's definitely doing something for the world.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.780]   It's really good.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.020]   I'm not saying that.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:56.100]   Do the kids watch it?
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.100]   I don't know.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.100]   What is...
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.100]   My daughter and I watch it together.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.100]   Yeah, that's cute.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.740]   My daughter is not like...
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:03.740]   I mean, I don't...
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.140]   Wait, what she watches on her own.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.140]   When she watches it, does it make sense to her?
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.180]   Because I feel like it's a more at you than it is your daughter.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.980]   Yeah, I mean, she...
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:12.980]   Yeah, it's...
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:13.980]   But she likes it.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:14.980]   Just...
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:15.980]   She understands English.
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:16.980]   It's not a high concept.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.980]   It is in English.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:19.980]   I don't know what else to say.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:20.980]   She gets it.
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:22.580]   I can't say that for PewDiePie.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.940]   This is the one that came out five days ago, almost two million views already.
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:26.940]   It's huge.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:31.060]   He's got 2.6 million subscribers.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.060]   No ads.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.060]   Oh, maybe...
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:34.060]   Oh, I don't know though, because I'm on YouTube Premium.
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.540]   No, because he does have...
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:41.540]   There's no ads, but he does have like PepsiCo did the $3 million.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.540]   He calls people...
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.540]   He's got...
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.540]   Who?
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.540]   Cloud.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.540]   He's got cloud.
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:49.740]   There's no question.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.740]   He is...
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.340]   For people who don't know who John Krasinski is, you might better know him as Jim Halpert
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.180]   from the office.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.900]   Or Jack Ryan, which you probably don't know.
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.700]   Or the director of the Quiet Place.
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:00.700]   The Quiet Place.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.620]   Yeah, very talented guy.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:08.300]   And as I said before, he's the next, in my opinion, Tom Hanks.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:13.980]   We always have to have a Gregory Peck or a Tom Hanks or Gary Cooper, a star who's just
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:14.980]   a good person.
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:19.540]   So, is he a question for you?
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.580]   Is he handsome?
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.580]   Sometimes.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:27.500]   I mean, I think all movie stars can be handsome with the right lady, if that makes sense.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.380]   I don't think he's handsome with his beard, but he was always cute on the office.
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.020]   I thought he looked terrible on the office.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.020]   Oh.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.020]   Yeah, he kind of looked...
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.020]   Jack Ryan.
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.020]   Big nose and kind of an odd looking guy.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.020]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.020]   But he was a personality.
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.020]   He was very appealing.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:44.740]   He would never say Tom Hanks was super handsome, but you don't want to be super handsome.
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:45.740]   He's not bad looking.
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.460]   Actually, Gary Cooper and Greg Newpeck are handsome.
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.460]   He's not bad looking.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:51.460]   He couldn't be horrible looking, but...
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.460]   Right.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:53.460]   Right, okay.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:55.300]   And he's married to Mary Poppins, so something's going on.
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.300]   Emily Blunt, she's cute.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.500]   My wife, Lisa says, "Oh, he really married up."
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.220]   So he must have the same opinion.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:05.300]   She must have the same opinion.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.300]   Here is the...
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:11.180]   Yeah, a lot of people are like, "No, I see why Emily Blunt married him."
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:18.300]   Oh, Carsten wants us to know that he is so handsome.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.420]   I'm not sure if he's so handsome or if he is so handsome.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.420]   I'll give you this.
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.380]   He's got excellent hair.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.180]   He does have nice, excellent hair.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:30.180]   You can tell it's starting to curl in on itself in this little pompadour thing.
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.180]   Just like mine.
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.180]   He also does need...
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.020]   Do you think Emily cuts his hair when they're at home?
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.020]   I don't know.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.500]   That would be pretty funny.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.620]   He also has really well-groomed eyebrows.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.620]   Well, that's easy to do.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.620]   You could do that yourself.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.620]   Oh, no.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620]   No, Leo.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.620]   Yeah, if you're willing to take some tweezers...
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:47.340]   Well-groomed eyebrows can be tough.
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.940]   Have you not ever taken too many eyebrows out?
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:51.940]   You don't want to overdo it.
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:52.940]   It's really a matter of...
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.940]   Deal.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:54.940]   Deal.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:55.940]   Deal.
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:56.940]   It's somebody who does it.
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:57.940]   I don't do it myself.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.700]   No, wait, wait, wait, wait, you do?
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.700]   Of course you do.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.700]   I do.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.700]   Don't you?
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.700]   No.
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:07.860]   I don't want the old man big, bushy eyebrows.
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.980]   The guy takes off the excess.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.180]   They put the blue wax here.
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.900]   They put the blue wax there.
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.900]   They go...
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:15.900]   And rip it off.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.980]   How does the thread thing work?
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.780]   I've never understood the thread thing.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:19.780]   See in the mall?
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.700]   Look at these thread things.
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.620]   And they're doing this to the eyebrows?
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.140]   I've never had the thread thing.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.140]   I only had wax.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:28.140]   We need to get Stacy.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.140]   Yeah, Stacy fell off.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.140]   You'll have to ask her.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.540]   She's our expert on female grooming.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.060]   I'll bet Karsten knows.
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.820]   Karsten also.
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:39.660]   There you go.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:45.260]   Stacy, Stacy, I got another woman question for you.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.540]   The thread thing with the eyebrows.
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:48.540]   How does that work?
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:49.540]   I can't figure that out.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.460]   They do it in the mall.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.020]   I actually have never had them threaded.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.100]   But don't they just wrap it around your little hairs?
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.180]   It's just like a tweezer.
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:59.140]   Why don't you just use a tweezer?
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.140]   Wouldn't that be...
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.580]   How do you wrap a thread around the ear to pull it out?
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.340]   Dude, I don't know big.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.500]   What does not everybody had tweezers?
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.500]   I mean, it's...
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:14.780]   Jeff, you'll have to tell me, Jeff and Stacy, whether I should care about this.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:15.780]   Because I don't.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:20.100]   Facebook announces its first 20 picks for the Global Oversight Board.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.380]   I can tell you about this.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.380]   Please do.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.980]   I got the preview before it happened.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.980]   I was part of the press conference.
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.420]   You guys, I definitely look like a robot.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.940]   Mark Zuckerberg, waxy skin.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.820]   There's definitely something non-human about him.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.820]   Do you think he's an alien?
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.700]   I wish he would invest in...
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:39.140]   He's clearly had someone help him, but he should invest in some additional assistance.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.140]   What would you do?
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:42.260]   Would you get some tanning cream there?
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.260]   No, but...
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:47.540]   The haircut could be better.
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:55.580]   A former Republican U.S. federal judge, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the former
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.060]   Prime Minister of Denmark, former Prime Minister...
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:01.060]   My friend, the valid respirator, the former editor of The Guardian, who is brilliant.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.060]   He's part of this.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.060]   Nice.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:06.060]   It's a very impressive bunch.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.060]   They went very high.
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:13.660]   Vice President of the Libertarian Cato Institute and First Amendment scholar, John Samples.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:14.660]   Michael McConnell.
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:21.340]   Former federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, heads the constitutional law center.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.940]   They got it from the left and from the right, right?
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:28.180]   They did Jamal Green from Columbia's First Amendment Center Institute.
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:30.700]   He's at the Knight First Amendment Institute.
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:31.700]   Yes.
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.540]   Couldn't get the towel guys involved, huh?
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.540]   Guess not.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.260]   Okay.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.540]   So they announced all this.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:43.660]   They expect them to work 15 to 18 hours a month.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.660]   Yikes.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.660]   They set up in five person mini-tribunals.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.420]   Sounds like a lot of work.
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.940]   The cases are referred to them by Facebook, by the way.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:54.940]   Facebook or users?
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:55.940]   Oh, really?
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:56.940]   You can also go in.
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.540]   Or the board members can decide on the road.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:00.540]   Okay, good.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.540]   Okay, good.
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:05.300]   And it's both Facebook and Instagram, which I think is moderately new.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:10.100]   Not one step, obviously, because you can't really see the content.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.660]   What's up?
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:18.700]   So the money that Facebook, $130 million trust, irrevocable trust, given over from that,
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:19.700]   they'll be paid.
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.700]   That's a good amount.
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:25.380]   Well, you'd have to be 18 hours a month.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.380]   You pay a month.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.380]   $25 an hour.
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.220]   That's going to that's going to add up to some real money there.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.700]   You could buy a Tesla after five years.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:40.860]   So interestingly, they're setting them up with hardware.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.660]   And I said in the question time, I said hardware.
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:53.140]   So I guess it's security so they can use the same system that is used to monitor things
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:55.340]   by the content checkers on Facebook.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.860]   So they'll have access to stuff.
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:57.860]   Interesting.
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:58.860]   Interesting.
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:04.180]   They were going to have them together for an orientation in person.
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:05.900]   That's not going to happen now.
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:13.340]   They'll get oriented to how Facebook does things and what the rules are and blah, blah, blah,
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.340]   blah.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:21.860]   The head of it all is the former head of Article 19, which is a big human rights organization.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.740]   Then there are four co-chairs and the four co-chairs worked with hydrocon struggles,
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:32.540]   the headhunter and Facebook to pick the rest.
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:37.860]   There's 20 members now and then these 20 members will pick the next 20 and they'll add up with
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.020]   40 members.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.020]   That's what I know.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.020]   There you go.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.020]   So it's like a Facebook chain letter?
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:47.820]   So you said one of the oversight board.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.820]   Please join me.
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:54.260]   One interesting question today from the press, well, they didn't ask me, by the way.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.700]   So I wouldn't mind an extra little gig right now.
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.700]   It's been hours.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:22:59.700]   That sounds just right.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:00.700]   Just right.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.700]   Just right.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.500]   Let's put that right in.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.340]   So what was I was going to say?
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.340]   I can't remember.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.340]   See, you don't get old.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.340]   You get old.
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:11.340]   You get pressed.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.340]   You lose remembering.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.340]   Don't interrupt me.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:14.340]   And I was like, sorry, dude.
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.340]   No, we didn't interview.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.340]   It's only fair.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.340]   No, it's just me.
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.340]   I forgot what it was.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.340]   Tennis guy.
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:20.340]   Tennis guy.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:25.580]   Are you excited that Serena and Venus and Sharapova, Naomi Osaka will be competing in a
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:30.580]   live streamed Mario tennis aces doubles tournament this weekend?
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.580]   It's very cute.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:38.740]   Next off in the Mario game with celebrities like Carly Plasti, Valleke, Gigi Hadid.
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:40.420]   It's the stay at home slam.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.140]   They're going to stream it on Facebook gaming.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:47.660]   Well, I want to know, is there a, is there a, wait a minute, I just need to get to play
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:48.660]   John McEnroe.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:51.140]   Oh, no, I think I think they're the commentators.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:52.140]   They're the commentators.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.140]   Oh, they're the commentators.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.140]   Oh, nice.
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.420]   John McEnroe and I just seen pretty cool.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.420]   She's gone places.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.220]   Man, I used to win.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:00.220]   That's fancy.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.220]   Well, that'll be fun.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.220]   Okay.
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.220]   I might watch that.
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.500]   Almost as good as our match game.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.740]   One million dollar prize goes to charity.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:17.180]   And I'm bet no matter what it is, I'm betting Serena Williams will just kill them all.
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:19.420]   Do you think she's good at a video game though, right?
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.020]   I would, she's good at whatever she does.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.060]   She's going to, and she's going to have a, there is a little bit of a ringer because Naomi
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.580]   Osaka apparently is an overwatch fanatic.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.220]   So she has some real video skills.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.220]   That's a hard game.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.020]   You must hope maybe.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.420]   Maybe could be Sunday, May 3rd.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:37.020]   Oh, we missed it.
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:41.740]   Oh, now we can find out who, oh, on top of the news.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.340]   Serena, did Serena do?
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.340]   How did she do?
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.340]   Let's see.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:46.340]   Better find out.
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:49.260]   I'm googling it.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:52.980]   The nice thing about this, you don't have to get out of your chair to do it.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.140]   Uh, let's see.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:56.820]   Oh, is there a video?
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:57.820]   What are we going to look like?
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:04.700]   Fritz and Addison Rae clinched the Stay at Home Slam, a virtual, is this the right one?
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.220]   Yeah, stay at home slam.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.820]   That's it.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.460]   Playa part together.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.420]   Play, oh no.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.820]   Play a part together.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:19.660]   Not playa part together.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:23.740]   I see playa, I think, you know, beach beach.
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.780]   Oh, Taylor and Addison beat Venus and DeAndre Hoppe.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.780]   Wow.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:29.780]   Wow.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.780]   Wow.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:31.780]   They advanced.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:36.020]   They beat Venus and DeAndre six to zero to advance to the semifinals.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.820]   There they faced Madison Keys and Seal.
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.500]   Uh, there they beat them six zero.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.500]   Wow.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:46.100]   And then they met Kaye Nishikori and Steve Akai Akoi.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.660]   Are those tennis players?
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.660]   Aoki.
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:49.660]   No, he's a DJ.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:54.260]   Oh, so it was, they'd have a real tennis player with a celebrity.
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:57.460]   Aoki is a celebrity.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.620]   So I put the video in at the bottom of other.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.780]   Just see, you know, sound up.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:02.780]   Oh, thank you.
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:03.780]   Just see how it looked.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.220]   We can see it.
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:12.660]   You know, at this point, we're doing anything we can to enjoy life.
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:15.260]   So I'm not going to knock it.
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:19.100]   Nope, I'm not going to knock it at all.
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.380]   And I just, Dean, has her pink headphones on.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:25.220]   She's, I'm so proud of her.
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.220]   She's done really well.
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.500]   I'm sure she's amazing.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.540]   She used to be, she used to be a regular on some of our shows.
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:33.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.540]   So this is kind of get the spend of the time with her.
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.940]   So this is a new, uh, cell phone.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:42.540]   This is a new, uh, I will turn the sound off because it's just annoying.
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:46.220]   So this is a new platform, uh, for Facebook, by the way.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:47.220]   So it helps.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:49.380]   Yeah, I was going to say, I think this was a way to show off Facebook.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:51.380]   You, uh, which thing?
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.380]   Oh.
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:53.380]   Oh.
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:54.380]   Exactly.
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:57.580]   There's an angle to everything.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.580]   It's cool.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:59.580]   It's cool.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.580]   It's cool.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.580]   Stay at home.
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:02.580]   We like the champions.
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:03.580]   We all like Facebook now.
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:04.580]   It's okay.
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:08.180]   My, I will say my husband went out and bought an Xbox because he was, he missed sports so
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:11.340]   much that he was like, yeah, I need to play sports.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.700]   So he and my daughter play.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:17.020]   Yeah, it's a huge, it is so sad to see this man without his sports.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.020]   So sad.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:21.500]   What's his, what's his sport of choice?
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.460]   He is a say, he's from St. Louis.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:27.300]   So he's a St. Louis blues fan and a St. Louis Cardinals fan.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.300]   Hockey first.
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:29.300]   Follows.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.580]   Thank you for telling me that I had no idea what sports those were.
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:32.580]   Yeah, it's.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.020]   Neither did most of our audience.
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:36.100]   So you're in good company.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.380]   So but you do, I bet know who Tim Bray is.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:41.300]   I've known Tim Bray, uh, for years.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.300]   He's legendary.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:45.100]   I didn't realize I kind of lost track of him.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:50.200]   Uh, I didn't realize he was, he's been a VP at Amazon and distinguished him as, uh,
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.340]   engineer at Amazon Web Services for the last five years.
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.700]   Quit in a huff.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:57.700]   I was in a huff.
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.700]   I quit.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:27:59.700]   I'm proper righteous.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.700]   Huff.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.840]   And I was going to say, let's not call it a huff.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.540]   I think it's a righteous huff.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.380]   But right, the huff can be a great principle.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.000]   No, no, no, no, no, this is a huff for a good.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   It's a principle.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000]   Yes.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.360]   I quit and dismay, he writes at Amazon firing whistleblowers or making noise about warehouse
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.740]   employees, frightened of COVID-19, by the way, that warehouse where they, where they
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:27.100]   fired the guy for organizing at its first COVID-19 death this week, what with big tech
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.780]   salaries and share of vestings, this will probably cost me Tim writes over a million
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:35.140]   pre-text dollars, not to mention the best job I've ever had working with awfully good
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.140]   people.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:40.980]   So I'm pretty blue, but I have to say, I really respect the principle.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:41.980]   You too.
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:46.000]   Of course, I'm going to still shop Amazon because it's too much trouble to shop anywhere else,
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.800]   but I'm glad Tim cares.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.400]   They've got to.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.760]   They've got to get their act together and they can't keep this up.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.760]   This is terrible.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760]   They can't keep doing this to people.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.960]   They've got to have a new policy.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:01.840]   I wish there was something as easy to use as Amazon out there.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.400]   I would use it.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.760]   Target online is easy.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:05.760]   Walmart is easy.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.600]   If you can stomach Walmart and they don't, and you know, the nice thing is about Walmart
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.360]   online, you don't actually have to go into Walmart, which is nice.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.580]   I try to find the same things I get on Amazon at Walmart and I can't.
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:16.580]   I can't.
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:18.580]   They don't have the same sewing supplies.
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:23.580]   Amazon comes to my door every day of the week pretty much now.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.980]   There's always a package or two.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.780]   And I'm feeling really guilty about it.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:30.140]   I really am.
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.740]   And Tim, God bless you.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.820]   Well, stop feeling guilty and do something.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.620]   Well, I need to have something else.
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:38.060]   The problem is I need supplies.
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:42.740]   Well, Amazon is not even delivering things as quickly anymore.
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:46.220]   So I know, but I mean, I still order them and then I get them a few days later and it's
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.220]   fine.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:51.020]   The problem is there's, I'd have to go to a dozen other places to find whatever things
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.020]   I want.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.020]   Not if you order online.
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:54.220]   Then you're just, I mean, who cares?
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:55.220]   You're ordering online.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:58.860]   Well, it's a lot easier just to go straight to Amazon and get it.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:29:59.860]   Sorry.
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.860]   Anyway, you're right.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.860]   You're right.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:02.860]   You're right.
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.860]   You're right.
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:04.860]   I'm can't say you're wrong.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:05.860]   I'm you're right.
[01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:09.460]   I'm just lying.
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.100]   I will, I will, I will, I will endeavor to do better.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:16.980]   I am going to start shopping Walmart and Target for my sewing supplies.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:17.980]   What is going on?
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.900]   Why is Stacy hanging up on me?
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:20.900]   She hate me.
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:21.900]   She hates me.
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.900]   She hates me.
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:23.900]   Doesn't she, Jeff?
[01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:25.500]   She says she cares about me, but I don't think she does.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.620]   That's really why I'm depressed.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:31.620]   I'm depressed because Stacy Higabotham thinks I'm an ass.
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.580]   No, I'm not.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:36.500]   And I think she's got some technical issue that she's addressing.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.780]   Oh, look, she's now on the Internet of Things.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:40.780]   What are you doing?
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:41.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:46.460]   So my back, my backdrop keeps coming back this was only when y'all call.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.860]   Is that why you've been hanging up?
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:48.860]   No.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.020]   Why have you been hanging up?
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:51.340]   Just so people don't think it's me.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:57.460]   No, it's, no, it's, I don't, my connection keeps going away, but it doesn't, I'm still
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:58.460]   I don't find that credible.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:30:59.460]   I feel like you're.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.540]   Oh, no, you're, you're laughing a little bit hard.
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:02.540]   Say that Stacy.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.540]   You got him.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:04.740]   I'm still on the chat.
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:05.740]   I don't understand.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:08.300]   Skype just keeps hanging up on me.
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.140]   Let me fix this.
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.140]   Hold on.
[01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:13.100]   That's our, you could be on the Internet.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.100]   You know what?
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:15.100]   Plug away.
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:17.100]   I don't mind if you have the Internet of Things.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:18.100]   Black round up.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:23.060]   Oh, no, I hate those because then you get this weird, like, plus you can't see my flowers.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.060]   Everyone look at my flowers.
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.060]   They're so weird.
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:26.060]   Where'd you get those?
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.060]   My birthday.
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.900]   Yeah, it's a belated birthday gift because they started delivering flowers again.
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:33.020]   Anyway, they're so fancy.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.020]   I need a fancier house.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.060]   They're really pretty.
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:37.220]   They're very, and they smell delicious.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.700]   Did you get them elsewhere in the house too?
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.860]   Is it just one bouquet or did you get a bunch of them?
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.500]   No, it's just one bouquet.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:43.500]   This is for my godmother.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.220]   Oh, who still sends me flowers?
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.900]   Even though I'm 42.
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:48.900]   How's she doing with your religious education?
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:51.540]   Is she really keeping you up?
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:55.860]   She brought me, she actually started me studying science.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.820]   That's the kind of godmother you got at.
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:59.860]   That's a good godmother.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:03.060]   She brought me, she bought me my first microscope and brought me into her.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.060]   That's awesome.
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.660]   Show me an electron microscope.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:07.340]   Oh my god, that's fantastic.
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:08.340]   Wow.
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:12.740]   Did she say something like you want to see God look through an electron microscope?
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.940]   No, she was an OB-JIN.
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:17.420]   I think she wanted me to become a doctor.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.860]   But, regardless.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:20.180]   Now, how's she doing?
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:23.140]   Is she working extra hours in Texas?
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.860]   Well, she is retired now.
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:25.860]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.860]   She is older, but she is also dealing with cancer.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.980]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:30.980]   I'm so sorry.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:33.380]   So it is sorry.
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:35.820]   And on that note.
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:38.620]   Hey, nowadays we're all in cancer's waiting room.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:43.300]   If it ain't the COVID gonna get you, it'll be some too.
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:44.100]   Yeah, we got it.
[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.660]   We got to cheer you up fella.
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:48.340]   Leo.
[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:50.500]   Jesus.
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.660]   I hope I'm not bringing you guys down.
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:53.860]   Oh, hey, Janet.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.660]   You're gonna bring in a bottle of booze.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.580]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:03.820]   We were doing a warm up for Cinco de Mayo, which was yesterday.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:06.900]   So on the first, Lisa said, we got to warm up
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.620]   because we haven't been drinking lately.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.980]   I'm gonna make margaritas.
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:12.700]   So she made margaritas.
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:13.340]   I had one.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:14.900]   You pre-gamed Cinco de Mayo.
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.580]   I was pre-gaming.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:17.300]   I had one.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.060]   I was asleep on the couch at 8.30.
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:21.820]   It was not good.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.660]   I felt terrible the rest of the day.
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.460]   It was awful.
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.140]   It was awful.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.940]   I'm so no, no drinking for me.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.220]   Doesn't make me, doesn't cheer me up.
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:33.420]   That could be really the precursor to all of this.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:33.860]   What else?
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:36.220]   OK, so I will say I stopped drinking.
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:37.020]   Yes, drinking is terrible.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.700]   This is Stacey's COVID-19 sanity tips.
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.340]   And I will tell you, I am in the midst of tapering
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:46.220]   off my antidepressants, which as my husband pointed out,
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.820]   is a really terrible time to do so.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:49.220]   Oh, I think not.
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:51.180]   No, you could get depressed with me.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:51.780]   It's something I've been trying to do.
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:52.660]   Let's get depressed together.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:56.500]   But no, I'm feeling happier.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.900]   See, isn't that interesting?
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:33:59.900]   But I should point out that's when you're
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.500]   at the highest risk of suicide is when you
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.620]   taper off the antidepressants.
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:03.820]   So be careful.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:05.820]   I'm aware you're killing me right now.
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:08.140]   I'm telling you, you're really causing some.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.460]   But point is--
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.660]   I am such a beam of sunshine.
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.980]   Every day.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.780]   Get outside.
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:15.940]   I agree.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.060]   You know what I have been doing?
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:18.020]   And you can't do that.
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.140]   Every day, I'm doing the same thing.
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:19.660]   Every day.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:20.900]   I've been bicycling to work and back.
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:21.260]   And now every day.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.060]   Excellent.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:23.580]   And then notice.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:26.260]   And then here's my big two pro tips.
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.260]   Don't drink.
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:28.780]   And then two every night.
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:30.220]   Right.
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.540]   Three things you're grateful for.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.180]   Oh, that's good.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.020]   I like that.
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:35.420]   It's so simple and so cliche.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.940]   But it really does help.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.740]   And yeah, you can still drink if you want to drink.
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:41.660]   I did stop watching TV at night.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:42.700]   Yeah, that's cool, too.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:43.780]   That was not good.
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:44.820]   We were watching Ozark.
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:47.500]   And I finally said to Lisa, you know,
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:48.540]   this is too violent.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:49.420]   I don't like this.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:50.020]   It's dark.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.020]   I don't want to watch this.
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:51.980]   I'm not going to watch it.
[01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:53.180]   And so I just--
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.740]   I've been reading and listening to music
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:56.820]   and stuff like that.
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:57.820]   Yep.
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:58.340]   Good.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:01.220]   Or watch something like Parks and Rec.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.220]   Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.780]   I think my brain--
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.300]   I feel my brain turned into jelly.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.220]   Could you watch Billions yet this season?
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.900]   I did watch the first episode of Billions.
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:11.340]   How was it?
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:11.900]   I've watched it yet.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:12.980]   I've been saving.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.820]   So that's what we're trying to decide to do.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:18.180]   We're with Killing Eve, for instance, we're saving it up.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.460]   Because I want to watch the whole season at once.
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.540]   But Billions, we cannot bring ourselves
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:23.860]   not to watch it because it's such a--
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:24.860]   Yeah, I think I'm going to do it.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.180]   It'll be the same way with succession
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:29.420]   when that comes back, if it's going to ever come back.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:29.860]   I think they--
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.380]   See, I'd never got into succession.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.300]   Billions was way better.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.140]   But I will tell you, I've been watching Office comedies
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.260]   because I miss--
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:36.740]   You missed the office.
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.580]   I didn't even go to--
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.020]   Yeah, but you missed having the camaraderie of an office.
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.860]   So which office comedies do you like?
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.180]   I like Parks and Rec.
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:46.700]   I know they're old, but I like--
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.220]   Did you watch the reunion?
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.100]   I didn't get to see it.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:49.100]   Yes, I did.
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:51.340]   What did they do?
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:52.340]   They made me feel all the feel.
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:54.820]   I saw them singing about the horse, Sebastian.
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:58.300]   Yeah, and I mean, was it awesome television?
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.620]   No, did it make you feel good and bring you back
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.180]   to Parks and Rec?
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.580]   Well, and they're all superstars now, right?
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.380]   Shush.
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:05.900]   Yeah.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.460]   But yeah, actually, someone's sitting in the chat,
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:10.980]   they've been rewatching the Golden Girls.
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:12.060]   That actually--
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:14.060]   I was watching the Golden Girls.
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.540]   Jesus, I don't know if I can do that.
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:16.380]   I got to do that.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:17.220]   You don't have to--
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:20.220]   Now that I'm their age, I'm really not going to watch it.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:21.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.420]   Oh, Brooklyn 99, the office.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.580]   OK, I never saw that.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:25.580]   OK.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.020]   Oh, Brooklyn, I mean, it's just late.
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:29.860]   I've been watching Letterkenny just because it's hilarious
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:31.420]   and wrong.
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:32.700]   And community, yeah.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.220]   Community?
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:33.700]   That's good.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.740]   I started watching that, and then I couldn't take it,
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.660]   so I stopped.
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.620]   Is it too annoying?
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:40.300]   It's a little annoying.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.140]   I watched a couple episodes, and I thought, this is--
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:46.140]   I understand it's funny, talented, little frenetic.
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.580]   I didn't like the style.
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.580]   There's something about the style,
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:52.100]   the way that they're delivering the one-liners beat.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.900]   And then another one-liner beat.
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.980]   There was something about it, it bugged me.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:57.380]   What are you talking-- which show?
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.460]   Community.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:36:58.860]   Oh.
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:03.660]   And then I did start watching Dave, which is weird.
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:06.460]   That's on Amazon Prime, I think.
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:07.860]   Anyway.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:08.380]   Anyway.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:09.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.540]   What we do in the shadows?
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.660]   That's a good show.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:16.060]   If you like vampires, it's a vampire comedy.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:18.100]   Andrew hates vampires, but he likes that show.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:18.580]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:20.540]   It's good for people who don't like vampires.
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:21.540]   I don't like zombies either.
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.860]   Done with zombies, no more zombies.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.780]   I've never liked zombies.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:27.020]   Well, now that we're all in zombie land,
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:29.980]   where the actual zombie apocalypse is happening--
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:32.660]   Yes.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:36.260]   I can, yay, has finally--
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.260]   Do you want Andrew?
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.380]   Because he knows the--
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:40.740]   Does he have an opinion on this?
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:45.460]   Remember that the public interest registry,
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:52.540]   a corporate.org, was sold to a company, a for-profit company,
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:54.100]   and the concern, the deep concern,
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:56.140]   was that they would raise the prices.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.580]   This was probably fueled by the fact
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.780]   that I can right before they did it,
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:03.860]   lifted the lid on pricing on.org registry.
[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:05.580]   Coincidence, I don't know.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:09.660]   So Ethos Capital, which was going
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.820]   to acquire the public interest registry
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:16.340]   and all of its assets from ISOC, the internet society.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.660]   I'm imagining a significant amount of money,
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.980]   has been told by I can, no.
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:23.500]   No, you can't have--
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:24.380]   you can't do it.
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.780]   We can't have a for-profit organization
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:30.820]   owning the.org nonprofit registry.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.620]   So good.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.260]   Now, I don't know what that means.
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.180]   Does ISOC continue to hold it?
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.420]   Maybe Andrew knows, but--
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:40.740]   I can go check.
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.220]   That's all right.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:42.060]   I don't care that much.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:42.620]   I don't know.
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.580]   We don't talk about domains very often.
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.060]   I'll be honest.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.220]   That's Andrew's business.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:46.820]   So--
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.860]   Well, I know, but--
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:48.380]   No, I know.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:50.100]   You know, I'm telling you.
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:51.500]   Hey, you know what, Stacy?
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:54.220]   I hear Andrew's in the domain business.
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:54.740]   No, I know.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.740]   You know that.
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.660]   Yes, I'll wear.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:58.380]   I'm wearing--
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:58.900]   Hey, oh.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:01.180]   I'm not a terrible wife.
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:04.460]   What does my husband do for a living?
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:05.620]   Oh, this is shocking.
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:06.700]   This is shocking.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.300]   Oh.
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:10.780]   For many young people, being a paid content
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:14.460]   creator on social media is the dream job,
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:16.900]   but it's not as easy as it may look.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:24.380]   A vice guide to 2030 says TikTok creators
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:27.900]   are working harder and making less.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.900]   Oh.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.340]   Oh.
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:33.140]   Shaking news and the internet of things.
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.060]   What?
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:34.500]   What?
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.940]   Are you going to talk about the Sonos stuff?
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:40.020]   No, Wink is about to move to a subscription model.
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:40.860]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.180]   What, though?
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:41.660]   What?
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.300]   That's not good.
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:43.660]   What is?
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.420]   They don't deserve my money.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:47.100]   They sucked for like the last six months.
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:48.940]   Oh, I'm disappointed.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:49.580]   So you're--
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:50.580]   OK, sorry, go on.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:54.020]   And Sonos, also in the IoT sphere,
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:57.140]   announced new stuff, a new sound bar, the arc.
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:58.300]   You're going to keep doing this?
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.660]   No, I'm never buying another Sonos piece of crap again.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:01.700]   OK, fine.
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:04.380]   But if you wanted to, you could.
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:06.100]   No, I've learned my lesson with Sonos.
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.180]   I already have two, not one, but two Sonos sound bars.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:11.900]   $800 for this thing.
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.140]   $800 Schmekers.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:17.500]   Dolby Atmos, which means it must have upfiring speakers.
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:21.260]   You know, look how nice it looks on your wall,
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:22.180]   underneath your TV.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:26.340]   Where's the picture?
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:27.540]   It disappeared.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.460]   OK.
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:32.020]   You immerse yourself in the music, blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:32.420]   I don't know.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:33.860]   I have a hard time getting two weeks.
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:35.620]   Yeah, see the upfiring speakers.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.580]   That's so it can--
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:39.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:42.340]   Can make sound come from above.
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:49.060]   And custom woofers, precisely angled tweeters.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:51.460]   $800 Smackers.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.380]   That is a lot of speakers, though.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:53.740]   You know what?
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:54.180]   I have to admit?
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:55.940]   My Sonos sound bars do sound pretty good.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.340]   This is the new one.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.260]   What else?
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:40:58.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:40:59.860]   What else did they announce?
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.820]   And then some other stuff.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:03.220]   New products from Sonos.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:14.260]   Next generation Sonos sub and the Sonos 5 speaker.
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:17.220]   I have all of these in their predecessors.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:18.660]   The sub is 700.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.100]   Sonos 5 is 500.
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:27.060]   Sonos is for people who don't really care how good it sounds,
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:29.620]   but they just like the convenience of it.
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:33.900]   Because that doesn't sound bad, but it's really pricey.
[01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:35.660]   Those fives look pretty, though, nothing.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.020]   I like how they look.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:39.020]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.060]   No, not going to do it.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:40.580]   Don't do it.
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:41.140]   Don't do it.
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:41.820]   Dr. Strange love it.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.100]   So why is Wink charging a subscription fee?
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:49.500]   Stacey Higginbotham, Star, Stacey.liot.com.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.620]   Hold on.
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.660]   I'm still--
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.740]   Hi.
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:58.540]   While you do that, I want to scare Jeff with a wobbly bridge.
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:58.980]   Don't look, Jeff.
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:41:59.980]   I put it up here.
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.140]   Don't look, Jeff.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:02.380]   It's wobbling.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:04.900]   I want-- this is why I put it up here.
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.260]   I'm not crazy.
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:07.540]   This is why I--
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.020]   It's undulating because of the wind.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.220]   I'm not crazy.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:14.740]   The whole metal thing is--
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:15.500]   Yeah, no.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:15.860]   No, no, no.
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.180]   Were you pre-traumatized--
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.820]   I know the trauma really comes from 9/11,
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.500]   but were you pre-traumatized by the 60th anniversary
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500]   of the Golden Gate Bridge and all those people getting on it
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.180]   and starting to buckle?
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.860]   Did that help?
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:27.940]   Didn't help.
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.580]   Didn't help.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.900]   Yeah, it was like this.
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:34.260]   A suspension bridge is, if you think of it,
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:37.340]   just a roadway suspended by cables.
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:38.820]   It's just floating in the air.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:44.580]   You mentioned being in that traffic jam as that's happening.
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:45.340]   Yeah, he's kind of--
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:48.420]   I'm not saying people, bridges are not meant to be.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:51.340]   But it's not going to come down in most cases.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:53.580]   Most cases, just what I'm on.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:54.860]   Unless you're an idiot.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:56.580]   By the way, they're plowed over my head.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.580]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:42:59.100]   OK.
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:42:59.580]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:00.500]   I can answer your question.
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.260]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:01.940]   Go ahead.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:03.300]   Go ahead.
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.100]   Sorry, that was a little North Dakota that was--
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:05.460]   It was good.
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.020]   I was.
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:06.540]   It was.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.780]   Oh, you betcha.
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:08.220]   Go ahead.
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.100]   There was Stacy.
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.860]   Sorry.
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.140]   So Wink is going.
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:14.020]   They-- oh, so short, too.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.420]   They've been having troubles for a while.
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:16.980]   They haven't been updating their software.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:18.860]   They hadn't been paying their employees.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:19.940]   We all thought it was--
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:20.900]   I put mine away.
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:23.100]   I was like, it no longer works.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.340]   But they want us to know that they're still there.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:30.060]   They really want to provide us with services,
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:32.460]   but they can't because they want to keep your day private.
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:34.060]   They had a bad financial model.
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:34.820]   Now they're going to charge.
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:35.820]   And I think that's fair.
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:40.780]   And now they want to charge you starting, though, next week,
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:42.140]   $5 a month, $4.99 a month.
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:42.660]   Well, it's not bad.
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:45.140]   You pay that much for, you know, nest cam storage
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:45.660]   and stuff like that.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.220]   But if you don't sign up for a subscription,
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.660]   you will no longer be able to access your Wink devices
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:53.340]   from the app with voice control or through the API
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:56.140]   and your automations will be disabled on May 13.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.820]   Do you think that sounds about as bad as Sonos?
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:01.460]   Is there a risk that people are going to--
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:05.100]   Or kind of start rejecting IoT because it's shenanigans like this.
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:08.940]   I just wrote about that last week because automatic shut down.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:10.580]   And I think if you're--
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:14.340]   --forgutted-- yes, I do think this is a problem for the community.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:15.820]   I think people are going to be like--
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:17.100]   People are going to be like, yeah.
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:18.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.940]   By the way, Stacy lives near this bridge, the Tacoma Narrows
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.100]   bridge.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:25.180]   Why did I watch that?
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:26.180]   It was terrifying.
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.860]   Is the bridge still there?
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:29.660]   I don't know.
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.660]   I've gone over the Tacoma Narrows.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.740]   Gallop and Gertie.
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:33.900]   See, not doing it.
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.060]   Not doing it.
[01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.140]   Oh, it's--
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.820]   There's two bridges there now.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.700]   I don't know if both of them are new or what the--
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:41.740]   Maybe one of them didn't make it.
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:42.900]   Not doing this.
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:43.900]   This is Spencer Bridge's--
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.420]   No, it's a Reebb--
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:46.500]   That's how it works.
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:48.660]   As long as the cables don't break, you're OK.
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:53.900]   The reaction my body is giving me right now.
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:54.220]   I know.
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.220]   It's really mean of me to be showing this.
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:57.180]   Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:58.260]   Chef, close your eyes.
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:44:59.100]   Don't look, Jeff.
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:00.260]   It's OK.
[01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.340]   You're not on a bridge now.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:03.700]   Oh, can I look again?
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:08.180]   Not showing it anymore.
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:10.900]   But you started it with your damn wobbly bridge post.
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:11.900]   I put it up there.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.540]   I just wanted a demonstration of my life--
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.340]   Lack of insanity.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:21.140]   --did your city shut down its subway system to clean it?
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:21.820]   Really?
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:24.820]   There was a daily news story about what a mess it was
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.700]   and filthy and the homeless were all staying there.
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.900]   My knowledge never, ever been cleaned.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:33.580]   That was better than that.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:35.620]   That's how it smells.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:38.340]   But no, it's better than that now.
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.020]   But now every night it's going to shut down
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.980]   and they're going to go in and clean all the surfaces, which
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.780]   is Herculean.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:48.140]   Nobody's riding it now because--
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:48.860]   Is it empty?
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:49.900]   Are people not riding it?
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:53.220]   Yeah, it's 95% partitioned.
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:54.620]   And of course, some people have to.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:55.780]   And that's the real issue.
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:58.580]   Because there are people who must go to work.
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:01.180]   Despite the dangers, they must ride mass transit
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.900]   despite the dangers.
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.540]   And it's for those people who want to keep this clean
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:08.340]   and disinfected.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:09.500]   And thank you.
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:12.900]   You're all my heroes.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.180]   New York's a wonderful place.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:18.860]   It just pains me so much to see New York hurt again.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:19.740]   I know.
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.460]   I know it is terrible.
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:24.140]   We're all hurting, though, Jeff.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.860]   We are.
[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:29.140]   Fortunately, Twitter is going to warn you
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:32.540]   before you send a vulgar tweet from New York.
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:38.340]   I saw my European friend screaming about the pure
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:41.940]   to that puretanical Americans doing this BS.
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.580]   Really?
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:47.420]   Clearly, they've never been trolled by Twitter.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:48.460]   It's not going to stop you.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:50.140]   It just says maybe you want to think about it
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:51.220]   before you post that vote.
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.340]   I haven't tried it yet.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.380]   You tried it?
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:54.180]   No.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:54.780]   I should, though.
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.600]   Shouldn't I?
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.140]   Should I do it right now?
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:58.300]   Send a vulgar tweet?
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:46:58.740]   What is it?
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:46:59.860]   What does it mean to be?
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:03.780]   I'll send it to you, Jeff, because you won't take that personally.
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:04.180]   Let me see.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:04.900]   What is vulgar?
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.620]   What would be considered vulgar?
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:07.980]   The F word will work.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.540]   OK, let me tweet.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:13.340]   @Jeff Jarvis.
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:18.220]   F-U-
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:19.460]   F-U-I never liked you.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:22.500]   And the bridge you rode in on.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:23.500]   Came in on, yeah.
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:27.860]   And I'm now going to tweet that.
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:30.300]   And people are going to say, why did you say that?
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.100]   It did not stop me.
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:33.460]   It didn't stop you.
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.220]   OK.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:39.660]   Now I have to tweet, oh, I am so sorry.
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:41.340]   It was just a test in Twitter.
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:47.220]   Was a test of the Jesus Christ.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:48.820]   Oops, can't say that either.
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:50.060]   I bet I can't say that.
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:52.060]   [SIGHS]
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:48:03.980]   My first Instagram tweet or post, I think,
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:06.500]   had a vulgarity in it because I didn't think anybody was watching.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:09.140]   And a teacher scolded me, saying there are kids on here.
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:10.620]   I was like, OK, sorry.
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:12.260]   There are a lot of kids on Instagram.
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:15.260]   Yeah, but this was like in the first week of Instagram.
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:17.340]   There were a lot of kids that first week of Instagram.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.180]   Maybe even then.
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:19.100]   Anyway.
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:23.060]   I apologize already.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:26.620]   I tried to avoid full-carity.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.180]   Should we mention the new Earnet Act?
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:31.820]   There's a new Earnet Act, what?
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.940]   Well, they're going to try to do it.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:38.460]   Ron Wyden has created the Invest in Child Safety Act
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.020]   to counter the Earnet Act, which of course we believe
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:46.900]   is really just a covert way of trying to suppress encryption.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:49.420]   Sure.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.860]   It seeks to establish a new office under the direction
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:53.780]   of the White House to better streamline the government's
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:57.620]   efforts at identifying and prosecuting online predators.
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:04.420]   $5 billion allocated for it without threatening
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:06.300]   to withdraw a section 230.
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:08.460]   So this is why this is Wyden was a co-author of 230.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:10.140]   So this is him trying to protect the internet.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.060]   God bless you, Senator.
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:13.060]   And Matthew Green, who we highly respect,
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:15.140]   cryptologist at Johns Hopkins, says, quote,
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:18.180]   "Unlike other recent proposals which use Silicon Valley
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:21.460]   as a scapegoat while failing to fund law enforcement agencies,
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:24.260]   this bill is a serious attempt to provide resources
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:27.060]   to the frontline agencies that do this essential work."
[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.420]   All right.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:30.180]   Right on, right on, right on.
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:32.260]   So the Earnet Act is still out there.
[01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:36.220]   I don't know what its status is because nobody's in town.
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:38.140]   But good.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:42.580]   Now you can credibly say, I support online safety
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:47.420]   for young people without supporting the Earnet Act.
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:49.020]   Invest in Child Safety Act.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:51.260]   Write your Congress Critter and say,
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:52.780]   hey, instead of that stupid Earnet Act,
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:56.020]   why don't we actually fund the people who are doing the work?
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.740]   This might work better.
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:03.980]   Why are Elon Musk and Tom Cruise doing a movie in space?
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:06.420]   And who's paying for it?
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:09.300]   NASA confirms Tom Cruise will make a movie aboard
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:12.660]   at the International Space Station.
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:14.620]   Is he going to go up there?
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:15.900]   Yeah, there's a huge election.
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.300]   He's in the film in space.
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.300]   NASA tweets is excited.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:22.820]   This is Jim Bridenstein, the administrator,
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:25.020]   is excited to work with Tom Cruise on a film aboard
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:25.860]   the space station.
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:27.900]   We need popular media to inspire new generation
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:29.180]   of engineers and scientists.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:32.140]   There's no way they're letting Tom Cruise go up there.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:36.780]   This is not an onion article.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:37.700]   It's made no sense to me.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:39.820]   Deadline says it's not a mission-impossible film.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.820]   No studio is in the mix.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.340]   It would be the first narrative film
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:44.660]   he's just shot in outer space.
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:47.460]   I'm thinking Tom's going to narrate it.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:48.860]   She hung up on me again.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:54.340]   Elon tweeted saying, "Should be a lot of fun."
[01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:58.460]   I didn't ask how supposedly he's confirmed this.
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:00.580]   I just have trouble believing this.
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.420]   We'll see.
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:05.100]   If I would do it if they'd let me,
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.700]   but I don't have Tom Cruise's sex appeal.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:12.060]   But you know, Esther Dyson's story with the shuttle?
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:12.900]   No.
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:15.620]   When they sent up a couple of rich people,
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:18.140]   there was a Russian who paid the money,
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:20.380]   but you had to have an alternative.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:23.220]   And so Esther was his alternative.
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:25.140]   She did all of the training.
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:28.180]   She did absolutely everything to be able to go up,
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:30.580]   but then he still went up until she didn't get to go.
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:32.060]   So there are tourists up there.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.500]   So I guess Tom could say,
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:35.100]   I'll give you a billion dollars or whatever.
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:36.460]   And NASA likes this.
[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:37.700]   It's good publicity.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:41.700]   NASA's very, very sophisticated when it comes to PR.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.100]   So all right.
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:43.940]   Okay.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:46.860]   But I'm just feeling there's a Scientology angle here too.
[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:48.500]   Oh God, no.
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:49.340]   No.
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:51.100]   Oh, Zeno, he's from space?
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.140]   Yes, that's right.
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:53.980]   See, there you go.
[01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:55.940]   I'm going to see Zeno.
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:59.380]   Is Elon, and he's going to get Elon Musk in Scientology.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:06.380]   That's all I've got.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.020]   Now, hold your house.
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:10.820]   We're all staring at you.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.660]   Let's wrap this up.
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:14.340]   So your family can get on that Zoom call.
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:15.260]   They've been waiting to do.
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:16.860]   I don't think they are.
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:17.780]   They know better.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:19.460]   No, it's okay.
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.100]   By the way, what was your good news?
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:23.260]   Stacy Higginbotham.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:25.500]   I was wondering, because if anyone thinks I'm pregnant,
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:26.500]   we're in trouble.
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:27.340]   I know we better fit.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.820]   I have found a place to live.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:29.820]   Yay!
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.220]   I thought it might be that.
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:32.220]   And--
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:32.860]   Do you like it?
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:33.860]   Are you buying it?
[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:34.660]   It's potential.
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:35.260]   We're buying.
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.820]   We should close at the end of the month.
[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:37.820]   Congratulations.
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:43.300]   And we are eligible for up to 2 gigabit Comcast every night,
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:45.260]   which is really applicable here right now.
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:47.740]   Oh, fantastic.
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:53.340]   Will you stay on the island?
[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:53.860]   Oh.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.540]   Are you going to have to drive the bridge?
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:52:59.900]   What happened?
[01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:00.420]   What happened?
[01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:01.220]   Do you not want to say--
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:01.740]   Stacy?
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:03.580]   Do you not want to say?
[01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:07.580]   No, I will stay on the island.
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:08.180]   OK.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:09.020]   Good.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:11.980]   You said, last time we talked, there were only a few houses.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:16.860]   Did a new one come available, or you just lower your standards?
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:19.740]   We found a house.
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:22.140]   I think we had to raise our standards.
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:22.580]   Oh.
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:24.060]   And money.
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:25.580]   That's good.
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.900]   That's good, Stace.
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.260]   I'm so happy for you.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:29.260]   Do you like it?
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.820]   Tell us about it.
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:32.620]   I do like it.
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:33.700]   It has this great view.
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:35.780]   There's a bald eel that lives outside.
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:40.860]   I'll have my own office that it'll be super podcast-y.
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:41.700]   Nice.
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:42.980]   It'll be great.
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:43.980]   I'm so happy for you.
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:44.500]   That's great.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:44.940]   I know you--
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:45.500]   I know that was a cool--
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.140]   So what would be real?
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:48.660]   --excitedy.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:52.420]   Yeah, it was a huge anxiety problem.
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:53.340]   When do I move?
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:56.060]   The end of June, because we're going to buy it,
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:58.340]   and then we have to replace the roof.
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:00.500]   It's on a well, so we have to--
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.300]   Oh, you're going to love that.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:03.820]   Oh, I'm there, too.
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:04.540]   I'm there, too.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.540]   We'll all be unwells.
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:11.580]   Stace, does it have a whole house generator?
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:13.020]   It will by the time we get there.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.620]   Because when the power goes out, Oregon,
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:17.340]   a big battery with the solar panels would work even better.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:17.740]   That's right.
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:19.220]   Being a Tesla person would do that.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.180]   Yeah, actually--
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.220]   You could replace the roof with solar.
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:22.700]   Yeah.
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:23.340]   And get a power.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.020]   But Seattle, there's never sun.
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.860]   There's enough sun.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:29.100]   It generates some.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.340]   Because the well pump goes down when there's power goes out.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:32.460]   Yeah, electricity means no water.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.340]   Because you can't even--
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:34.060]   Yeah, we have a lot of--
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:34.420]   --the toilet.
[01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:36.940]   But can you--
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:37.620]   Be here toilets.
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:39.500]   --but it's not fun.
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.620]   Are you on septic?
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:44.180]   We are on septic, but I've been on septic before,
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.100]   so that's not--
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:46.540]   Well, it's not bad if it's a good well.
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:47.300]   It's not bad at all.
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:49.180]   In fact, we get the best water in the world.
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.340]   Of course, we've got a lot of filtering and stuff,
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:53.020]   so it is the best water in the world.
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:53.380]   But it's--
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:53.940]   So here's the question.
[01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:54.460]   Yeah, we did.
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:55.340]   No chlorine in it.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:58.340]   I can use it for my sourdough starter, which is nice.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:54:59.260]   It's really good.
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:54:59.780]   Oh.
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:01.300]   I distribute the white--
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:01.940]   --the water softly.
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:03.420]   She wants to do the water softly.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:04.700]   My parents used to have water softly,
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:06.900]   and you always felt oily.
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:08.340]   It's a little slippery.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:10.540]   So I love having soft water.
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:10.900]   Yeah, we do so.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:14.660]   I love it for my clothes.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.940]   Your clothes are-- they don't get--
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:18.700]   the hard water is worse on them.
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.740]   Your coffee tastes better, I think.
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:24.740]   You don't rinse as well as soft water.
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:27.740]   You just don't feel clean at the end of a shower.
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:30.660]   No, you just use less-- you learn how to use less soap.
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:31.180]   Right.
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:34.780]   And some soaps work better with softer water.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:39.180]   They may not-- we have a modern collagen.
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:42.620]   Water softener plus a UV light that kills anything
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:43.860]   in the water.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:48.020]   Plus then, for the refrigerator and the coffee sink,
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:51.260]   we have additional reverse osmosis and charcoal filtering.
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:52.540]   That water is so good.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.660]   Even the water without the extra filtering
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:58.300]   is so delicious and so pure, I'm very, very happy with it.
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:00.380]   I think it's better for you, honestly.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.700]   I really do.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:02.700]   And I don't feel slippery.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:05.100]   So I think maybe a modern water softener,
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:08.420]   you wouldn't have that problem.
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.380]   We'll see.
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:13.860]   There's also an ionizing thing that
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.860]   keeps the minerals in the water,
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:17.260]   so it doesn't deposit the pipes.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:21.140]   Yeah, we don't do that.
[01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.620]   We just have it all.
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:25.100]   All the solids taken out because we don't want it.
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:26.580]   So does the house need anything else?
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:30.540]   Any bathrooms you have to redo or anything stays here?
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:32.380]   There's kitchen stuff.
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:37.300]   And I will tell everyone it is not the $10 million house
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:38.220]   on Bainbridge Island.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:38.740]   I know.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:41.380]   Can you believe how quickly they jumped on that?
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:41.940]   Geez.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.340]   I was a little worried about that.
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:43.940]   I'll be honest.
[01:56:43.940 --> 01:56:46.100]   I was like, should I tell them, or should I just wait?
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:46.860]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:47.540]   That's all right.
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:49.420]   It's very rare that people come to your house.
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:51.340]   It's only happened a few times to us.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:52.180]   Oh, that would be it.
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:54.780]   This would be this would be a nice place, though.
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:55.540]   Yeah, it would be nice.
[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:57.260]   It's a former army barrack or army.
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:58.220]   It kind of looks like it.
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.180]   It's very square.
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.780]   Oh, US Navy is the operational command center.
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:03.500]   It's fancy.
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.300]   Oh, this is nice.
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:06.060]   And a mere 10 million--
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:07.660]   That is not my house.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:10.100]   It's a mere 10 million dollars.
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:10.900]   I couldn't afford the funds.
[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:11.500]   That is my house.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.940]   You should show up there and walk us
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.860]   moving in the indoor pool.
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:15.740]   Nice.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:17.300]   Nice, everybody.
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:19.580]   Look at Stacy's new place.
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:21.980]   That's beautiful.
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:23.980]   That's beautiful.
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:25.100]   Really, really sweet.
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:26.060]   Congratulations.
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:27.780]   I couldn't be happier for you.
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:31.180]   You believe it, $10 million, and you only get four bedrooms?
[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:31.780]   The hell?
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:32.620]   Wow.
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:33.460]   It's ridiculous.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:34.620]   How many bathrooms, though?
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:35.100]   That's a set of--
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:36.540]   It's got like seven bathrooms.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:37.340]   I don't know.
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:40.140]   I guess it's really more of a public place.
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.780]   Yes.
[01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:44.300]   The indoor pool takes up a lot of space.
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:44.860]   And--
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:45.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:47.820]   Indoor pool, baby.
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:48.340]   Bar.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:49.580]   Mm-hmm.
[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:51.300]   Yeah, the hotel esc bar.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:52.940]   And one of the rooms looks like a closet,
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.780]   like a full-on closet.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:58.660]   Do you ever wish she could live in a place like that?
[01:57:58.660 --> 01:57:59.780]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:01.340]   No.
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:04.300]   Right now, our housekeeper can't come,
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:06.620]   so we're having to clean our house, but we're still there.
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:08.100]   Yeah, just think about that.
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:10.340]   Yeah, I have like seven bathrooms, don't you think?
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:11.940]   No, thank you.
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:13.980]   You'd have to have a rotation.
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:16.900]   So, Stacy, how much stuff was in storage
[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:18.380]   that you just haven't missed?
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.620]   And you're going to look at it and say,
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:21.940]   why did we even move this?
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:24.740]   Oh, I mean, we have, I think, two rugs rolled up,
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:26.580]   but we don't have anything in storage.
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.300]   We don't have a lot of stuff.
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.140]   Well, you don't-- I thought you had a separate truck,
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.820]   storage stuff.
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:31.180]   Oh.
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:32.380]   Oh, no.
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:32.900]   Oh, no.
[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:33.300]   No.
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:34.740]   OK, oh.
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:36.620]   I mean, I have a--
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:39.180]   there's a curtain over here in my study with an alcove,
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:41.300]   with some boxes, with like paintings and--
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:42.860]   Oh, no, no, I thought you had it like a--
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:45.780]   like you loved it in a storage place.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:47.140]   No, someone was talking about that.
[01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:48.420]   Oh, no, that was a different person.
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:49.220]   OK.
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:50.620]   No, there's nothing--
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:52.140]   I thought you always said that at some point.
[01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:53.140]   I thought you said that at some point.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:55.140]   That was the other Stacy, you know what I'm saying?
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:59.460]   When you move temporarily in Austin.
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:02.300]   Yes, we were in an apartment for like six or seven--
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:03.180]   That's the sense of--
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:04.180]   Yeah, not crazy.
[01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:05.180]   I'm not crazy.
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:05.660]   You're not crazy.
[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.180]   I understand that.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:10.860]   Let us wrap things up.
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:12.380]   No, we're not going to do a-- you know what?
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:13.540]   I don't want to do a change log.
[01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:14.380]   I'm sick of it.
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:15.220]   I'm tired of it.
[01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:16.220]   There's nothing interesting in it.
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.300]   We don't want to put you over the edge.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:19.420]   We're not going to put you over the edge.
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:22.060]   This is exciting, though.
[01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:24.940]   This is a neural net that generates music.
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:26.860]   Jeff, you're going to-- not you, Jeff.
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:28.580]   My Jeff, you're going to be in trouble.
[01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:29.220]   He's a drummer.
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:29.620]   He's a musician.
[01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:30.900]   I thought I was your Jeff.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:32.500]   You're my Jeff, but not the Jeff who's
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:33.940]   the drummer and the musician.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:39.500]   Are you ready to hear what it sounds like when
[01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:42.860]   the open AI jukebox starts a rockin'?
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:44.500]   What's cool is he can do it in different styles.
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.500]   Some of these are pretty good.
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:50.020]   Here's the Elvis Presley style lyrics also by the AI.
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:50.780]   You ready?
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:53.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:59:53.620 --> 02:00:01.900]   This is the open AI.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:02.900]   They don't know how to--
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:04.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:13.180]   Sounds like Elvis, but I don't think
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:17.740]   Elvis would have sung from dirt to lipid to cell to heart
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:23.820]   with my toe, sis, with my o-sis, with time.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.620]   That sounds like something an AI might make up.
[02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:28.260]   Do you know who Alan Jackson is?
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:29.180]   You country fans do.
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:32.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:35.820]   This is a song for me, a cheer-up song.
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:38.740]   You all can know it's still to play, all right?
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:39.300]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.380]   Let the dog to me spray the wave.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:42.900]   Yeah, baby.
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:44.660]   Did Alan Jackson do tall tall trees?
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:45.660]   Who was that?
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:46.100]   I don't know.
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:48.180]   He did "Don't Rock the Jukebox."
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:49.180]   Oh.
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:51.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:56.620]   I think AI has the country really down.
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:57.140]   Really down.
[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:59.820]   That's the country is like the second most formulaic thing
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:00.020]   ever.
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:01.420]   He did do tall tall trees.
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:02.140]   Tall tall trees?
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:03.260]   I like Joe Jackson.
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:04.180]   I mean, Alan Jackson.
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:04.900]   That is Alan Jackson.
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:05.780]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:09.460]   Here, though, is pop music, which I would argue
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:12.860]   is fairly formulaic in the style of Katy Perry.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:15.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:26.900]   I feel like I'm in a bad dystopian dream.
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:28.220]   That wasn't Katy Perry.
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:28.940]   That was like--
[02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:31.180]   It didn't sound like Katy Perry at all.
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:32.620]   You know what it sounded like?
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:35.580]   Did you ever see that movie from the late '90s,
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:36.300]   the commitments?
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:38.420]   It was about the Irish people doing small music?
[02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:40.900]   It sounded like their songs or Bonnie Rate.
[02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:41.620]   That's true.
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:45.700]   OpenAI's jukebox is at jukebox.openai.com.
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:49.260]   Forget paying for Spotify, Apple Music.
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:54.580]   You can get your own for free.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:57.940]   Here's a little Celine Dion and Ella Fitzgerald
[02:01:57.940 --> 02:01:59.540]   together at last.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:02.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:04.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:09.060]   It's actually kind of--
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:09.820]   It's kind of--
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.260]   It sounds like Christmas.
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.660]   It's weird, but in a way, it's kind of interesting.
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:15.220]   I mean, like they--
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:16.020]   Then some of these--
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:16.420]   It's lovely.
[02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:17.620]   Some of these--
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:22.820]   By the way, the lyrics are helped out by the open AI
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:25.940]   researchers, and Sonomone are not.
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:28.660]   And they get really weird.
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:29.940]   Here's a banana-rama.
[02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:31.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:34.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:45.860]   Just to stop this, because it's painful, I'll give you another--
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:48.420]   Did y'all-- have you all talked about this meme does not exist?
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:49.820]   No.
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:55.500]   Oh, Google it, because it's not a--
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:56.940]   This meme does not exist.
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.340]   Oh, I do remember this.
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:01.380]   This is-- these are generative AI's, right?
[02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:02.380]   Oh, OK.
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:03.180]   Yeah, I do remember this.
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:05.020]   And built memes.
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:07.100]   Yeah, I was like, I think I was gone last week.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:08.420]   No, we didn't talk about it last week,
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:10.220]   but I think we've talked about it a while ago.
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:13.780]   So these are generated by artificial intelligences using
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:15.100]   GAN.
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:17.020]   They're not very good.
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.540]   So they don't even make any sense.
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:21.060]   Some of them are really fantastically accurate, though.
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:21.900]   I will say.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:22.900]   Let's see.
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:22.900]   Here's--
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:23.900]   Like they--
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:24.900]   Here's Leonardo DiCaprio.
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:27.620]   Thank you for the world cold.
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:28.500]   OK.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:30.100]   Here's the most interesting man in the world.
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:31.820]   What do you think he's going to say?
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:32.820]   No one knows.
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:33.340]   OK.
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:34.820]   Never mind.
[02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:35.900]   Never mind.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:37.420]   I can't say that one out loud.
[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:39.380]   Let's see what the doge has to say.
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:43.220]   Who let the doge out?
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:43.740]   OK.
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:45.060]   Very lesbian.
[02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:45.660]   OK.
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:48.820]   I can't read these on the air, so I won't.
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:50.060]   But there you have it.
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:52.980]   How about little Yoda?
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:53.980]   Is it going to be backwards?
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:54.820]   Memes I am.
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:55.900]   Memes that is.
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:56.500]   Memes that is.
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:58.060]   Oh, that one's OK.
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:03:59.060]   Yeah, I guess.
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:01.460]   Here's the one I just got is the forces with you,
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:02.940]   then not anymore.
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:04.740]   Oh, whoa.
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:06.700]   Yeah, because you can have them do more.
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:07.820]   You know, it's not--
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:09.340]   Yeah.
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:11.780]   Refresh.
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:13.620]   Perdicilio.
[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:14.140]   Yeah.
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:15.700]   The responses to your tweet.
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:16.220]   Yeah.
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:16.860]   Oh, dear.
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:18.260]   Are you kidding me?
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:19.060]   Oh, god.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:21.260]   I can never go on Twitter again.
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:23.300]   They wanted to leave that.
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:25.460]   Oh, I could delete it, couldn't I?
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.660]   Anyone have context about this?
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:28.980]   No, I just put a second tweet.
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:29.980]   I was saying--
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:30.980]   Sorry, I was--
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:31.500]   Wow.
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:33.540]   I missed something, says Ryan Wakefield.
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:34.060]   Oh, god.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:35.260]   Now people are going to believe it.
[02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:36.820]   Well, the Jeff Sharvers done now.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:40.460]   You can't-- that guy, you can't take him anywhere.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.700]   Michael Martinez.
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:42.980]   I usually listen the next day.
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:44.180]   I guess I'll find out what--
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:45.100]   Oh, my god.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:45.620]   Well, you know what?
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:46.860]   This might have been good for ratings,
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:48.540]   so I'm not taking it down.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:49.420]   Wait, what?
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:51.500]   Wait, what?
[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:54.380]   You know, it's not easy having half a million followers
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:57.940]   on Twitter, but somebody's got to do it.
[02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:00.180]   All right, that was my lousy pick.
[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:01.180]   What do you got, Stacey?
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:06.260]   I usually let Stacey start, but she's frozen.
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:08.380]   So why don't you do a number, Jeffrey?
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:09.260]   Oh, geez.
[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:09.700]   Oh, geez.
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:10.220]   OK.
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:10.420]   OK.
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:12.740]   You got a bunch of--
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:16.180]   Yeah, I got what I like here, which is--
[02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:23.540]   so Louftansa has a travel and mobility tech newsletter.
[02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:25.060]   It's actually pretty good.
[02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:26.940]   We'll be pressing for them right now.
[02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:32.380]   But they looked at the entire market capitalization
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:35.580]   of Air France, KLM, United, Louftansa, American Airlines,
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:36.500]   Delta Airlines.
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:36.940]   Yeah.
[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:39.580]   It's less than Zoom.
[02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.420]   That's depressing.
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:44.460]   That's really depressing.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:49.340]   So if you add them all up, all the airlines,
[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:51.540]   there were $35 billion.
[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.500]   Zoom is worth $37 billion.
[02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:57.180]   And the five airlines revenue in 2019
[02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:59.420]   came to $205 billion.
[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:02.700]   Zoom's 2019 revenue was $622 million.
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:03.740]   Wow.
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:06.620]   By the way, this is the revenue in 2019.
[02:06:06.620 --> 02:06:08.780]   This isn't even the COVID revenue.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:09.860]   No, no, no, no.
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:12.860]   So that's just how much Zoom is doing.
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:13.380]   Yeah.
[02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:14.580]   Wow.
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:16.660]   Wow.
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:19.860]   Should have bought that Zoom stock when I had the chance.
[02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:21.340]   Should I have?
[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:23.620]   I actually sold all my stock when this started.
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:24.820]   I said, I'm getting out of the market.
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:26.020]   I don't know what the hell's going to happen.
[02:06:26.020 --> 02:06:27.660]   No, this is when you buy.
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.780]   I want to wait until it crashes.
[02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:31.220]   But you can't just try to buy it.
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:33.780]   Just buy periodically.
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:35.140]   I mean, it's not as exciting.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:36.660]   We're talking about dollar cost average,
[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:37.220]   ix Stacy.
[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:38.620]   That's what I'm talking about.
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:39.140]   OK.
[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:40.940]   That's the saviest, easiest way to do it.
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:45.100]   I took everything out because I'm an old man, Stacy.
[02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:50.300]   And I won't have a chance like you young people to recover.
[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:52.980]   So did you take it out before or after the crash?
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:55.500]   Oh, I lost about 10% on the value it had been.
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:55.860]   Oh, OK.
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:56.540]   So not a huge--
[02:06:56.540 --> 02:06:57.060]   Early on.
[02:06:57.060 --> 02:06:57.780]   Yeah.
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:01.060]   And actually, I give a lot of credit to Lisa,
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:06.140]   who is somehow some sort of magical financial wizard.
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:08.540]   We had a huge retirement fund, what
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:10.860]   they call it, the fine benefits plan, a pension fund.
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:12.660]   The whole company was using.
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:15.100]   And for some reason, I don't really understand.
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:17.980]   In January, she said, yeah, let's take that out of equities.
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:19.980]   And we're going to put it all in money market.
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:22.820]   In January, she saved that--
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:24.740]   she's going to fund more than a million dollars.
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:27.860]   And the way these things work is if you lose money,
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:31.660]   the owners have to make it up because we have a responsibility
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.140]   for the pension to all the employees.
[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:36.580]   So everybody should thank Lisa Laporte
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:38.900]   because your pensions are safe thanks
[02:07:38.900 --> 02:07:41.300]   to her financial wizardry.
[02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:41.820]   Wow.
[02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:42.820]   Yeah, I know.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:44.700]   Isn't that incredible?
[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:47.060]   It was a fairly substantial chunk.
[02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:50.260]   And her financial advisors really tried to talk her out of it.
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:53.460]   I said, oh, no, this is the time to get in.
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:56.660]   Well, this is a bear market, a bull market.
[02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:58.860]   We couldn't-- this is a 10-year bull market
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:07:59.660]   that no one knows.
[02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:02.260]   The sky's the limit.
[02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:03.700]   Yep.
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:06.580]   My problem is there's stuff I would have gotten--
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:09.420]   but my capital gains would have been killing.
[02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:12.220]   Well, yeah, I don't want to look at my tax bill.
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:12.780]   Yeah.
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:13.820]   Because I will have some.
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:14.660]   But--
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:16.900]   Maybe your business will lose money and you can offset it.
[02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:18.460]   Oh, probably will.
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:18.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:19.460]   Yeah.
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:21.560]   Yeah.
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.340]   Hey, hey, we're supposed to cheer him up.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:24.860]   I know.
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:25.420]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:27.660]   That was my bad angel speaking.
[02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:28.260]   No, that's true.
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:30.060]   Cheering me up.
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:30.560]   Yeah, I got--
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.060]   You left shoulder.
[02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:31.820]   I did get--
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:33.660]   I got it at everything.
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:34.460]   Got it out of it all.
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:35.500]   It's all retirement money.
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:38.820]   So there's no tax liability until I retire,
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:42.580]   which could happen in about five minutes from now, actually.
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:45.060]   Did you-- oh, that was the number.
[02:08:45.060 --> 02:08:45.560]   Zoom over.
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:46.260]   Oh, you gave your number?
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:46.960]   I'm so sorry.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.260]   Well, because you froze up.
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:48.760]   It froze.
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:52.060]   And so now it's your turn, Stacy, for your thing.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:52.460]   OK.
[02:08:52.460 --> 02:08:53.920]   Next week, I have some really good things.
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:54.980]   But this week, what have I had?
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:56.420]   I was curious if you've tried this,
[02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:59.580]   because I saw the news about it.
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:01.780]   No, I have not tried it yet.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:03.980]   But it is now for sale.
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:05.420]   So that's why I put it here.
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:07.980]   So we have a Z-bolt in our door, our front door,
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:11.220]   as most people do, one hopes.
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:14.420]   It is nice because it doesn't look like a smart deadbolt.
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:16.060]   It looks like your existing deadbolt.
[02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:17.180]   It fits in.
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:19.800]   I install these types of deadbolts all the time.
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:22.960]   The way this looks from an installation video perspective
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:25.120]   looks exactly like what I've installed.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:27.560]   It takes maybe six to 10 minutes.
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.680]   You do have to get the right size, though, for this one.
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:31.600]   Right, because you already have a hole in your door
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:33.320]   for the existing deadbolt.
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:33.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:35.600]   You basically unscrew.
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.960]   It's roughly four or five screws.
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:40.480]   And everything kind of falls out of your hands.
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:41.600]   This makes me a little nervous.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:42.600]   It uses a C cell.
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.320]   How long is that going to last?
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:47.160]   And can you get in your house when it dies?
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:50.900]   They usually die in a way that is very aggressive in the app
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:52.580]   that tells you that it's about to happen.
[02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:55.540]   It looks like there is a key, or is there?
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:56.580]   I don't know yet.
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:58.020]   Is it only Bluetooth?
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:09:58.780]   Yeah.
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:02.020]   No, there's usually some sort of manual way.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:04.620]   It's very cool looking.
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:06.500]   I really like how it looks.
[02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:08.740]   And pay attention to these C cells,
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:10.380]   because you're going to see them in more places.
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:10.740]   Really?
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:12.420]   Well, I see.
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:15.700]   Because you can make things smaller
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:19.600]   and as more companies put out products that use them,
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:22.020]   people are going to stock more of them in their home.
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:23.380]   What is-- why is C cell?
[02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:24.420]   I've never understood this.
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:28.660]   Like some of my things want AAA, AA, CD.
[02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:29.660]   Because you can--
[02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:31.700]   I have a clock that has four D cells in it.
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:33.420]   Like why?
[02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:39.460]   Well, it's basically like a size for performance.
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:45.340]   So that gets you the equivalent of roughly four AA batteries.
[02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:45.940]   Ah.
[02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:47.100]   Maybe three AA batteries.
[02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:49.420]   So it's more compact than the AA's would be,
[02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:51.700]   and certainly easier to change.
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:52.940]   Yes, those are words.
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:53.860]   Those are the good words.
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:55.300]   Use those words.
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:59.100]   I see shells by the C-shore.
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:01.020]   Somebody says that's not a C-shell.
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:02.820]   I don't know what they're thinking.
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:03.900]   Looks like a C-cell.
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:04.740]   C-shell.
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:06.180]   No, I can't say it.
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:08.860]   Looks like one of them.
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:12.140]   OK, so but you don't-- is level a good company?
[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:13.180]   It's a new company.
[02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:14.380]   No.
[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:17.620]   So I don't know how we feel after automatic,
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:20.660]   petnet, apparently, Wink, and other companies
[02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:22.140]   have been shutting out.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:26.180]   It would be depressing to not be able to get in your house
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:29.380]   because the company shut down.
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:31.980]   I don't think--
[02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:35.780]   Stacey, which length is best for my door?
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:38.740]   There are two common decks at length, standard and long.
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:39.460]   You just measure it.
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:40.860]   Yeah, it was like, I can't tell you now.
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:41.860]   I have to see your door.
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:43.420]   I see my door.
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:44.220]   I don't think--
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:46.900]   Honestly, Lisa, being the smart person in the family
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:49.300]   would not let me get this.
[02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:50.860]   OK.
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:53.940]   Do you have a Bluetooth deadbolt?
[02:11:53.940 --> 02:11:55.620]   I have a Wi-Fi one right now.
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:56.260]   Do you like it?
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:59.660]   I mean, the nice thing is you can open the door for people.
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:01.300]   Like, you know, the kids or whatever.
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:02.060]   They say, I can't get in.
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:02.980]   I forgot my keys, whatever.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:05.340]   You can open it from work, which you never go to.
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:08.300]   But if you did, what else?
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:09.980]   What are the other benefits?
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:13.740]   So I have one with a keypad.
[02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:16.100]   And I like the keypad even without the cell phone
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:18.420]   connectivity, because you don't have to carry keys.
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:20.580]   This does not have a keypad, so I don't know exactly.
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:21.580]   No.
[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:23.220]   So you have to have your phone, which--
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:26.700]   You can get a code to your clean person?
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:27.700]   No.
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:28.700]   No.
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:30.700]   Because that's not a keypad.
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:31.380]   She can.
[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:32.980]   This one, keypad.
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:37.540]   Well, you can credential people via the app.
[02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:40.220]   Oh, but then they have to put the app on their phone.
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:40.660]   Do you--
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.500]   Yeah, that's the downside there.
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:45.020]   Do you have a Schlage in August?
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:47.220]   Which one do you have?
[02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:49.500]   I have both.
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:50.300]   I won't ask any more.
[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:51.380]   And I used to have a quick set.
[02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:52.180]   Quick set, too.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:53.860]   I mean, I used to have a lot of--
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:54.860]   I like IoT.
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:57.060]   And I do have a doorbell camera.
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:00.300]   But I just get nervous about the lock being an IoT device.
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:02.740]   Not that locks do anything, except they're just really
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:04.380]   recommended.
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:05.700]   People always ask me that.
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:07.500]   I'm like, look, I have a quick set.
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:09.420]   I have a quick lock that you can open with a screwdriver.
[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:12.380]   I mean, it's way easier to open my door lock
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:14.100]   than it is to actually hack into the--
[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:15.060]   It's symbolic.
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:15.980]   It's just symbolic.
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:19.300]   It's like, please don't come in here.
[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:22.500]   Although, I have to say, we have bars on our door and everything.
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:24.300]   I mean, you'd have to really--
[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:27.180]   you'd have to brand battering it down, batter it down.
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:29.460]   But I guess people could do that.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:30.820]   Works with iOS and Android.
[02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:35.020]   It is $230, the level lock from level.co.
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:36.300]   And it's only to get certified.
[02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:36.740]   That's the--
[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:38.740]   Oh!
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:41.740]   Well, then I trust it more because Apple's in the mix.
[02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:47.460]   What do you do on Android if you're--
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.740]   you just do not HomeKit, then?
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:52.500]   I've tested-- I mean, we have iPads and everyone else
[02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:54.140]   have my families on an iPhone.
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:55.060]   This is built to--
[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:55.100]   I just test.
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:58.140]   --ancy grade, one stroke A standards
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:02.020]   and protected by the best in class data encryption.
[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:04.100]   Open from anywhere with Apple HomeKit.
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:06.500]   Just ask Siri, open the door.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:09.940]   I was wrong.
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:12.700]   It says it has a CR2 battery.
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:14.940]   That's one of those little dime batteries.
[02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:16.940]   But it looked like it had a bigger battery.
[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:18.820]   So I don't know.
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:19.820]   I don't know.
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:24.420]   Installs seamlessly inside your current debt inside.
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:26.180]   Yeah, you don't change out your deadbolt.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:28.180]   Oh, so I still have a deadbolt?
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:30.660]   So you look-- yeah, it looks-- well, you always
[02:14:30.660 --> 02:14:31.380]   still have a deadbolt.
[02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:32.980]   But it looks like from the outside,
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:34.580]   no one can tell you have a smart lock.
[02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:36.940]   Oh, but the key doesn't do anything anymore.
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:37.540]   Right?
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:40.140]   You can't stick the key in the lock.
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:42.100]   OK, well, this is where now I have to--
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:42.580]   It's unclear.
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:43.660]   --ask me this next week.
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:44.780]   Yeah, are you getting it?
[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:45.380]   Are you getting it?
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:46.740]   Are you getting it?
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:48.620]   I'm definitely getting a demo of it.
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:49.420]   I don't know if I'm getting it.
[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:49.860]   You're amazing.
[02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:53.620]   You got more locks than Carter has little liver pills.
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:55.420]   I have more locks than I have doors.
[02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:57.140]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:59.540]   Put this on your desk.
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:14:59.940]   Cool.
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:01.900]   They actually send you those if you ask for them.
[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:04.020]   They'll send you a little faux door.
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:05.060]   Desk door.
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:07.060]   A little tiny door.
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:09.380]   A little tiny door that you lock the door.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:11.300]   A little tiny door.
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:12.300]   Yeah.
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:14.580]   If you just put it in the wall, you kind of think--
[02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:16.100]   It stays so you can slam it on you.
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:19.180]   People would think, what, do you have a turtle that
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:19.820]   can open the door?
[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:21.540]   What is that door for?
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:22.060]   What is it?
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:24.180]   I want it to be a little tiny door.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:26.140]   I should have shown you something different.
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:26.860]   OK, next week.
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:27.180]   Save it.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:28.940]   No, next week, I have something better.
[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:30.220]   The week after that.
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:31.420]   We have a backlog.
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:33.580]   Now we've got a problem.
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:35.260]   Somebody just trying to keep going, Leo.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.980]   Chatter him, trying to make you sure you come back.
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:39.180]   That's adorable.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:41.180]   Oh.
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.740]   Thank you, chicken head.
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:45.340]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:46.620]   You made my day today.
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:49.300]   Stacey Higginbotham, thank you for being pretending, at least,
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:50.500]   to care.
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:56.380]   She is in charge at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:57.500]   What?
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:57.900]   What?
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:59.060]   Oh, can I plug something?
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:00.060]   Yes, please.
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:01.860]   Hey, you guys.
[02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:05.940]   I'm doing an event on why IOT did not predict COVID-19
[02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:08.980]   and how we can build up an infrastructure that can give us
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:11.780]   warning and detection for this and other pandemics.
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:12.700]   Oh, this sounds great.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:15.260]   It is going to feature the CEO of Kinza, the smart thermometer
[02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:19.340]   maker, an epidemiologist from Scripps.
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:24.980]   And Dina Mendelsohn, who is Director of Health Policy
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:26.420]   at a company called Electra Labs.
[02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:27.660]   This sounds amazing.
[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:30.900]   Validation of consumer wearables.
[02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:34.220]   So this is how to make it medically certified, basically.
[02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:35.740]   So we're going to talk about, like--
[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:38.340]   Why didn't Kinza tell us this was happening?
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:39.340]   Exactly.
[02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:42.380]   Why didn't we know that the simple answer is, we weren't
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:43.220]   looking for it.
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:46.060]   But we're going to get into that and talk about what's
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:49.180]   happening and what we need to do going forward.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:53.820]   And it'll be May 20th at 11 a.m.
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:55.180]   PT.
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:56.740]   Yes, 11 a.m.
[02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:57.580]   PT.
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:02.220]   And you can go to staycniot.com/covid if you would like
[02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:02.700]   to sign up.
[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:04.020]   And it's totally free.
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:05.820]   Oh, I'm going to definitely attend.
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:07.740]   That sounds great.
[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:08.100]   Why didn't I--
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:09.780]   You might be recording a show.
[02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:11.660]   Oh, what day of the week is that?
[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:12.260]   May 20th.
[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:13.300]   It's Wednesday.
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:15.500]   Yeah, I'll be on the air with Windows Weekly.
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.260]   They don't need me.
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:18.100]   I can watch and do the show.
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:19.780]   Well, it'll be archive too.
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:20.660]   Nice.
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:22.460]   Oh, you're producing it.
[02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:23.340]   Yeah, this is me.
[02:17:23.340 --> 02:17:25.020]   This is your thing.
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:26.020]   That's all we need.
[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:29.140]   Hey, congratulations, Stacy.
[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:29.620]   Oh, yes.
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:30.460]   And then it's you and I--
[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:31.300]   This is just the beginning.
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:31.780]   Yeah.
[02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:32.380]   It is.
[02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:34.260]   You know what's cool is you don't have to have a venue.
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:37.620]   So this makes it a lot easier, doesn't it?
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:38.340]   I'm hopeful.
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:39.900]   I mean, this is my first one.
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.180]   But I was really excited.
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:42.900]   I literally woke up one night.
[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:43.980]   Someone actually tweeted me.
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:45.660]   It was a doctor who listens to the show.
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:47.740]   He's like, I don't understand why we didn't have this.
[02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:48.220]   And I was like--
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:48.700]   We should have done.
[02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:49.660]   Yeah.
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:50.820]   That's a great question.
[02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:51.420]   I know.
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:52.660]   But it asks.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:53.460]   Well, tell me--
[02:17:53.460 --> 02:17:54.580]   And then I was like, we should do it for everyone.
[02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:57.460]   I get up every morning and I do my kin's a thermometer,
[02:17:57.460 --> 02:17:59.540]   make sure I'm not dead yet.
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:00.700]   And although it's--
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.540]   my temperature seems low.
[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:04.500]   And then I wear an aura ring, which also
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:07.820]   shows me temperature fluctuation and other things.
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:11.340]   I think this quantified self is kind of useful during all this.
[02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:13.340]   So I'm very interested.
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:14.740]   Are you part of the detect study?
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:16.140]   I am.
[02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:16.900]   OK.
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:18.060]   Can the aura ring study?
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:20.060]   Yeah, the aura ring is doing--
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:22.060]   with UCSF a study, apparently they're
[02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.620]   going to send me an antibody test.
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.980]   But I did just take one on Monday.
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:27.740]   So I don't need another one.
[02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:30.580]   But I guess second opinion is always appreciated.
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:31.620]   Well, consider it an aura ring.
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:32.020]   Yes.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.540]   Yeah.
[02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:34.300]   Yeah.
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:34.500]   But--
[02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:36.380]   Are you to store it until you--
[02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:37.500]   after you feel sick again?
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:37.860]   Well, yeah.
[02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:39.540]   And what are you going to do anyway?
[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:41.380]   If I said, oh, yeah, you got the antibodies.
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:43.900]   Is it mean I run out in frolic in the park?
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:44.980]   Naked?
[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:46.460]   Maybe.
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:50.420]   So Dr. Neil Ferguson, who was one of the primary people
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:52.020]   of studying policy in the UK.
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:57.820]   He was part of the Sage Committee, the secretive committee.
[02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:00.220]   And so he just had to quit.
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:02.540]   It's very British because you offer your head
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:08.380]   straws the first because his girlfriend came over to his house.
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:08.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:11.580]   Now mind you, Dr. Ferguson has had the disease.
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:13.100]   So if there are antibodies, he has them.
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.020]   There were two missing points in this.
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:16.860]   One is he's already had it.
[02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:17.500]   Two is--
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:19.100]   They said, oh, and he's married girlfriend.
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:20.460]   She's in an open relationship.
[02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:23.860]   So firing him, it seems, a little--
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:24.820]   It was so British.
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:25.860]   The British just loved it.
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:27.260]   Literally lop off your head.
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:29.060]   Yeah.
[02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:31.340]   Well, that could have a negative consequence.
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:33.700]   So everybody go to stacianiot.com.
[02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:34.980]   Sign up for the newsletter.
[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:39.300]   Then go to stacianiot.com/covid and register for that event.
[02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:42.780]   Is there a limited number of people who can attend?
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:44.380]   I don't think so.
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:45.740]   We'll find out what Zoom can do.
[02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:46.980]   What was it to say?
[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:49.540]   So let's you know.
[02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:51.220]   I think you're going to get hundreds of people.
[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:53.900]   That is really an interesting topic.
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:56.420]   And you've got excellent people.
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:57.540]   Yeah, they're really smart.
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:58.500]   I've talked to all of them.
[02:19:58.500 --> 02:19:59.300]   I can't wait.
[02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:00.860]   Just the cats meow.
[02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:03.700]   Jennifer Raden actually created the detect program.
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:04.900]   Oh, interesting.
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:05.540]   OK.
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:06.220]   That's Scripps.
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:08.220]   Yeah.
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:08.940]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:10.900]   We're doing our own event on Identity.
[02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:11.540]   Did I mention that?
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:12.300]   I did mention that.
[02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:12.660]   Oh.
[02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:13.580]   The last pass event.
[02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:14.460]   Yeah, next--
[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:15.220]   Oh, the last pass event.
[02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:16.140]   Oh, that next Thursday.
[02:20:16.140 --> 02:20:17.140]   Yeah, so that's a great fun too.
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:18.260]   That's also streaming.
[02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:20.580]   Honestly, why don't you repeat what time it's on, Leo?
[02:20:20.580 --> 02:20:23.060]   It'll be Thursday.
[02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:24.100]   I don't know what time it's on.
[02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:25.940]   Sorry.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:27.620]   Nevinam, I don't know.
[02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:28.340]   I don't know.
[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:29.500]   I don't keep track of these.
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:32.860]   This is the part of the show where we pitch poorly.
[02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:34.900]   That's what they do at the end of Stern.
[02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:36.260]   Everybody has their plug, right?
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:38.860]   But it's already 9.30 or 10 in the morning.
[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:40.340]   Everybody's at work.
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:41.260]   Where are you going, Joe?
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:44.540]   I said the event is not on the Twitch schedule.
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:45.620]   That needs to be rectified.
[02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:48.220]   Oh, well, we'll fix that right now.
[02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:49.740]   That is an oversight.
[02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:51.340]   It should be on the Twitch Live schedule.
[02:20:51.340 --> 02:20:53.100]   Karsten says it's at 4pm.
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:53.620]   4pm?
[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:55.380]   Thank you, Karsten.
[02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:58.380]   Yes, Pacific time, because we're in the Pacific.
[02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:00.820]   It should be really interesting that Steve Gibson,
[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:04.140]   Andrew Keene, Gerald Bukell, Cyber Security and Identity
[02:21:04.140 --> 02:21:05.780]   Trends, he's wrong.
[02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:08.580]   It's 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern.
[02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:09.100]   So there's--
[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:10.580]   He cares about where we're at the world.
[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:12.340]   He thinks he's in Harvard still.
[02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:14.100]   Thursday, May 14th.
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.220]   Thursday, May 14th.
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:20.140]   1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern time.
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:24.180]   See, it says it right there in pink.
[02:21:24.180 --> 02:21:28.500]   You don't have to show the ad copy.
[02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:30.940]   It's like looking behind the curtain.
[02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:32.460]   But I know attention to that ad copy.
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:34.020]   I make it up as I go along.
[02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:35.900]   Jeff Jarvis is from his heart.
[02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:38.140]   He is the director of the Townite Center
[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:41.060]   for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:44.220]   School of Journalism at the CUNY, the CUNY, the City
[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:48.940]   University of New York, and a much-esteemed colleague
[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:49.940]   and former TV guy.
[02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:50.940]   And a friend.
[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:51.860]   And a friend.
[02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:53.780]   And he at least is a friend.
[02:21:53.780 --> 02:21:54.780]   Yes.
[02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:57.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:21:59.340]   You know, I just like to tease you.
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:00.180]   Stacey, you know that.
[02:22:00.180 --> 02:22:01.340]   He is so brutal here.
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:02.380]   I'm so sorry.
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.820]   Of course, you're a friend.
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:05.140]   We're all friends here.
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:05.660]   We are.
[02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:06.180]   I--
[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:06.820]   Thank you.
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:09.540]   It does, honestly, it always cheers me up to do this show.
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:13.540]   I really enjoy it, because you and Jeff are smart,
[02:22:13.540 --> 02:22:15.780]   interesting, and it's a really--
[02:22:15.780 --> 02:22:17.980]   that's one of my favorite shows to do every week.
[02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:19.780]   One of my top 10 shows every week.
[02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:21.260]   The highlight of the week for me too.
[02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:24.660]   Especially now when I have nothing to get me out of the house.
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:26.580]   It's like it was scary, you guys.
[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.780]   And as I said on Twitter, Jeff, no.
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:30.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:34.420]   We'll see you next time we do this week at Google every Wednesday,
[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:34.940]   1.30--
[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:36.180]   Every damn Wednesday.
[02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:39.620]   Every dang, jig of dang Wednesday, 1.30 Pacific, 4.30,
[02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:41.740]   Eastern, 20.30 UTC.
[02:22:41.740 --> 02:22:45.460]   You must tune in and watch us live at twit.tv/live.
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:46.620]   There's audio and video.
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:48.620]   If you're around at that time, you don't have to, though,
[02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:50.820]   because whether or not, please subscribe.
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:51.740]   That's right.
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:53.980]   We have on-demand versions of the show.
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:55.900]   It's a podcast.
[02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:58.740]   All you have to do is either go to the website, twit.tv/twit,
[02:22:58.740 --> 02:23:02.860]   or as Jeff says, Jeff knows, subscribe.
[02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:05.980]   That way you'll have a copy available on your device
[02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:07.340]   the minute you need it.
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:09.940]   Formerly known as a netcast.
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:13.220]   But now I gave up on that, too.
[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:15.220]   I gave up on a lot of things, basically.
[02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:17.940]   It's good to give up and accept where you're at.
[02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:19.380]   You're where you're at, Liam.
[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:21.540]   I am where I am.
[02:23:21.540 --> 02:23:23.860]   Just like Popeye, I am what I am.
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:26.860]   That's all that I am.
[02:23:26.860 --> 02:23:28.300]   We will see you next week.
[02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:30.300]   Thank you, everybody, on this week in Google.
[02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:31.300]   Bye-bye.
[02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:34.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:37.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:40.040]   (gentle music)
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:42.280]   (buzzing)
