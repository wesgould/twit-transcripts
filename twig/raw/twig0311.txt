[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.280]   I watched your, I want to hear, you still using Google 5?
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.780]   Yeah.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.980]   Got it right here.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.580]   I watched that.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.080]   I watched that.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.780]   We had, you know, Rana Modio was here.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.680]   And who else do we have besides Ron?

[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.280]   That's right.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.780]   So it was a great, but it's not the same without Jeff
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.280]   Jarvis, I got to say.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.780]   Oh, you find it too.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.880]   Well, no, I haven't yet.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   I put the case on.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.580]   Let's talk about the guest.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.880]   Then I'll explain that briefly.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.880]   Also with his Kevin Marks, former Googler himself.

[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.380]   Kevin Marks.com.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.080]   It's not the same without birds behind him.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.680]   I know.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   I know.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.180]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.580]   It was going to be 102 degrees in San Jose today.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.580]   So I came up to San Francisco.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.580]   I'm going to leave and I'm hiding in a cupboard in Mozilla
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.380]   doing this before home-rewed cyclops.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.380]   Oh, good.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.480]   Yeah, it's way too hot right now.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.780]   Although San Francisco has a little bit of air conditioning.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.480]   Thank goodness.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.780]   So San Francisco is not not as like still 30 degrees
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.680]   cooler than San Jose.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.980]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.980]   So have you done fire?
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.680]   Are you thinking about?
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.280]   Oh, here's one of these.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.980]   I got it.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.780]   Oh, you got it, Kevin?
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.280]   I haven't.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.980]   I've got the next six, but I haven't.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.480]   Right.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   I've got a plupton fire.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.080]   Oh, so we we harass.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.880]   We're not on C-Mobile.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.880]   So changing it would end up costing money, I think.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.180]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.880]   I don't think you'd have an advantage if you're a T-Mobile
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.480]   customer, to be honest, as I was.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.580]   We harassed Matt Cutts till he harassed somebody else.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.380]   And strangely, we both got an invitation.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.780]   Yes.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.280]   Oh, cool.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.580]   I think Jason got an invitation too.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.980]   He's deciding whether to do it.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.580]   I did.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.380]   And my lighting is all weird over here.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.380]   So this is about all you get.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.880]   Okay.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   The dark, Jason.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.480]   I know.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.980]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   No, I got the invite.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   And the more I look over it, the more I'm like, you know, the $30 plan
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.180]   that I'm on right now with five gigs of air quotes on limited data
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.680]   versus what I would get on fight like I find myself on the fence
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.980]   suddenly and I was dead set to do it initially.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.180]   And now I don't know if I should.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.180]   Which makes me wonder if I was going to be more and for whatever
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.180]   reason Google couldn't make it more.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.780]   Because it isn't spectacular in any respect.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.580]   Oh, no.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.580]   But I still want to try it.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.880]   But here.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.580]   So here's my here's my problem.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.580]   I always have a problem.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.080]   I thought it was purpose.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.680]   I went and did a Google event in London.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.980]   And to all the speakers, they gave Nexus sixes.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.780]   Nice thought.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.680]   Perfect.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.080]   I have my Nexus six with my eight.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.580]   Oh, and you can do a five six and I can do a five six.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.980]   And this is just perfect.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.680]   I'm so happy.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.980]   So then I find out that no, I had the international Nexus six.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.880]   Oh, it works with the US Nexus six.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   Now we could fix that.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.380]   I think.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.080]   Oh, no.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.280]   Are you sure it's different or different chips?
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.980]   Oh, maybe it is different chips.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.880]   It is that you're just a crude because there's a.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.480]   Different chips there.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.980]   You can download a five.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.780]   No, no, no.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.980]   It doesn't have certain antennas.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.480]   Oh, so yes, radio.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.880]   It's this.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.580]   Whatever it sees.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.380]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.380]   So why would that's terrible?
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.880]   They gave you.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.380]   I call useless.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.380]   No, but it's very nice of them.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.780]   Geeze.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.080]   They give a little nice six.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.680]   So I call the five people.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.480]   They say, I can't throw any very much.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.680]   I call the next six people.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.580]   They get a little mess.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.880]   I mean, I wrote some stupid messes.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   And I'm, you know, beggars, choosers for God's sake.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.080]   Is there anybody watching the show in Europe would like to trade a US edition.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.780]   Nexus six for a European.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.880]   Well, I'll figure it out.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.780]   Well, but here's here's it.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.080]   So now now.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.880]   I'm looking with some greedy lost.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.480]   We're going to talk about it.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.780]   I think at the either the one plus two, right?
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.480]   It looks really.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.680]   I watched the entire.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.680]   I am excited about the last two.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.180]   Oh, you made it through that without it crashing on you?
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.680]   Okay.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.280]   Oh, I did.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.280]   I did.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   I didn't see any of the codes.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.680]   I know, right?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.880]   And then I also the new Moto X.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.280]   And so I'm thinking and they're both priced very well under $400 and Samsung's having an event.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   Next month.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.580]   So a couple of weeks.
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:44.780]   So so do I, you know, get a one plus two, which does look very appealing and make that my 18 T phone and then make my Nexus six.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.780]   My five phone.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.280]   There we go.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.780]   Okay.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.480]   So let me tell you the pros and cons.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.280]   Okay.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.080]   Jason already outlined one, which is is not cheaper.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.880]   Jason has that oddball team mobile plan.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.680]   The go plays you go plan, which at 30 bucks a month is probably the cheapest plan I've ever heard of.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.980]   You only get a hundred minutes, but who uses their phone anymore and with Hangouts,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.480]   voice, you know, data calling.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480]   That's my way around it.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.080]   And right.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.580]   So that's all I pay is 30.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.880]   And then you have unlimited text and data.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.480]   So that's not how fireworks is 20 bucks for unlimited voice and text.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   And then you pay 10 bucks a gigabyte for data, but you only pay as you go.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.480]   And so that's maybe okay.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.980]   It still has the T mobile international capabilities.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.180]   It basically looks like they're exactly duplicating those.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.280]   Which is good.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.080]   So those of those are actually those are great.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.980]   I used that when I was in Europe and was fabulous.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.480]   It's not fast, but it's something.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.980]   Well, it's throttled to 128 kilobits.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.980]   256 is what Phi says.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.980]   Of this wish did now.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.980]   It was 128.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.180]   That's time I tried it and in theory, you can upgrade it, but actually I couldn't get that to work.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.780]   I paid for the upgrade and it wasn't much faster.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.780]   So I don't recommend it.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.280]   Okay.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.180]   But nevertheless, it's enough to check your email or you know what I used it for.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.880]   You use for photos.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.680]   Yeah, photos exactly.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.980]   So every night I'd get home and I would I have a phone that has Wi-Fi.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.480]   So I would copy the photos over to the phone and just let it run overnight because it take forever.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.280]   But at least they were backed up to photos.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.980]   Drop at a time and that was like a backup, which I like.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.980]   What about like maps?
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.980]   How well it works?
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.980]   It's okay.
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.780]   You know, it's kind of fun while you're cruising.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.080]   You can.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.780]   You can see where you are.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.280]   Although what I ended up doing is getting the here maps, which are free and pre downloading.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.880]   You can pre download on Google Maps.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.980]   It's just it's a bit hard to do.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.380]   Yeah, and it seems like they got a lot to do.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.980]   Liar after one.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.780]   No, I mean, I've used that before.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.280]   He's that quite successfully, but they made they hit it.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.980]   So you've got to do some ridiculous search query and then hit about them that appears magically.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.380]   Okay, as opposed to being impressed anymore, but it is still there.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.180]   And it and it works fairly well.
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.680]   You know, it's still can't do rooting for you because the routing requires and talk to the server, but it can show you.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.380]   That's the kind of thing the data might be sufficient for things like reading information and traffic information.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:11.280]   So if you don't have to download the maps cache, then that works and it'll let you cut you basically you select an area and it caches that area.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.480]   So you know where you're going.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:20.880]   You can kind of fun because you can see yourself going down the river and see where you like so there is a very slow.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.380]   Very slow.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:29.880]   There's a point in which we are in we're going by Bratislava and we're in whatever that country is Slavakia.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.380]   I don't know.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.680]   Anyway, I can't.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   It's the former Czechoslovakia.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.880]   It was the Slovakia.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.080]   I guess part of the book.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.480]   And so it's kind of cool.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:38.880]   You go on.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.580]   We're in Bratislava.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:48.080]   Okay, and when we got in the Danube out of the canal, the mind damn you canal, I could say, oh, we're in the Danube now.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.780]   That was kind of fun.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.080]   There was another guy doing the same thing.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.180]   Right.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.980]   So that's kind of fun anyway, but that's off the point.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:02.580]   The biggest negative on Phi I think is that you you kind of have to mess up your Google voice account.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.380]   Well, I already did sign up for it.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.680]   It asked me at that point, you want to port.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.080]   You can't go back and I didn't know I have the choice.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.980]   I didn't think I had a choice to get a new number.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.080]   If you leave it, leave it, ironically, so I've already done it.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.480]   But I didn't use many voice features.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.180]   And some of the features still there for instance, the forwarding is going on, but the call screening is gone.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.080]   I can't do the contacts groups screening.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.880]   I used to have different voicemails for different groups, family, friends.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.980]   What about the visual voicemail?
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.880]   Visual voicemails still there.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.080]   By the way, Google said there's a 49% improvement in visitor voicemail.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.680]   Transcriptions last week and that's true.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.780]   Really?
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:46.280]   It's they're like, they're like, they're perfect now or almost noticeable.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.780]   That is again.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.480]   Noticable.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.080]   Have they retranscribed the old ones?
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.780]   No.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.580]   But have you noticed that Jason?
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.580]   Is it a lot better for you?
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.480]   I was stunned.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.080]   You know, I have now that you now that you mention it because I actually did see one come through the other.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.880]   Now I was like, wow, I can actually read that start to finish.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.780]   It's like weird.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.980]   I just thought it was a strange deal, but then I put the story of the rundown today.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.280]   I was like, oh, it's a thing.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.180]   It's figured it out.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.980]   It's kind of stunningly accurate like it like I couldn't believe it.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:23.280]   So and I'm still so I'm still getting as you can see, I'm still getting a visual voicemail in my hangouts.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   They do suggest weirdly that you not use Hangouts, but use the Google Messenger program.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.180]   I heard you say that last week's show.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.180]   And I there's I've been I said screw that I'm not using.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.180]   I'm and so I haven't seen any.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.480]   I don't see any reason not to use Hangouts, frankly.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.080]   They say that, but I don't see I can't everything works fine.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:52.180]   So even if you get a new number for five, even if you don't say, yeah, port my Google voice number, you lose Google voice.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.980]   So I feel like that's the biggest negative of all.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.480]   It may pre sage the end of Google voice.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.580]   Or it may just be, well, we we own these numbers, you know, Google your Google voice number is owned by Google.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.380]   So we'll just use those.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.980]   Yeah, my problem with with I can't.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.880]   Hey, I've got an AT&T a limited grandfather.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.480]   So I don't want to lose that be.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.880]   So let's say I switched to five and then, you know, I then I lost after the one plus.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.780]   Well, then I'm off by because it'll only work on the right next to six.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.780]   I wouldn't switch if I were you.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.580]   So switching entirely just doesn't make sense, but I do want to try it.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:39.980]   I just don't get what Google is doing this for because there's no, you know, it's not like the gigabit internet,
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.080]   which reinvents internet and forces the other carriers to the other ISPs to go along.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.180]   This doesn't do anything.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:53.880]   Oh, one more thing that would be valuable if if you work in some areas or go in some areas where sprint is good,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:01.180]   but T-Mobile's not and or vice versa, the fact that it is T-Mobile plus sprint plus Wi-Fi might be of value to you.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.680]   Well, here's the other question I have for you Leo.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.980]   So I get pissed off every single time I walk into my Starbucks.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.480]   I check my email.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.680]   Oh, crap.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.880]   It's found the AT&T.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.880]   I have to go to the web.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   I have to load Google.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.280]   I have to say, yes, I won't do anything horrible and legal.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.680]   I've wasted four times.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.580]   The latte is up.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.780]   I might as well not have bothered.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.580]   It just turned off the Wi-Fi will.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.980]   The Wi-Fi at least automatically signed on to its own damned Wi-Fi.
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.880]   It's well, that's an interesting question.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.380]   It says it will automatically join open access points.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:38.880]   That's because those are open access points, but then they middle box use death so that it is an access point.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.580]   I'm wondering since it's destroying the world.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.580]   So Google's on the step.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.580]   You do not be like that.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.980]   But I suspect they will actually have a they'll be they'll be password and do it in the background.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.680]   I've had a very good suggestion for two years on twig.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.280]   If I do say so myself, which is that they come up with a universal standard that says I hereby agree.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.980]   I will not do these 10 horrible things on your Wi-Fi.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.880]   And when my phone comes into your Wi-Fi, just go ahead and friggin sign on.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.380]   And if you want to show me an ad on a webpage, OK, but to make me stop.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.680]   Oh, you know what you want?
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.280]   I go to that.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.480]   You want a Windows phone?
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.180]   No, Windows phone does that.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.580]   You're giving.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.180]   Yes.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.380]   Just say yes to everything.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.980]   Well, the problem is so there's a sort of protocol problem here.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.280]   So the problem is when the when the zero-conf stuff was being invented.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.480]   The value was it lets you connect to things without having to type anything into boxes.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.480]   And this is this was brilliant thing that Stuart Cheshire came up with at Apple.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.280]   He basically said why is IP networking so hard with Apple talk?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:48.080]   We need to make it as easy and he sat down and worked at how to do it and wrote a bunch of specs and then shipped it and Mac and it's now universal.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.880]   But then a lot of people said, but but we'd actually like people to log in.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.980]   We like to know what's going on.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:14:10.180]   And so there's this industry of hideous middle boxes sprung up where they they will give you a supposed internet connection, but actually everything you everything you touch turns a shit because they've rooted all the web through their horrible browser and horrible things happen.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.680]   So your your phone thinks it has a Wi-Fi connection and starts downloading podcasts and it gets web paid.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.180]   Instead.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.180]   Yeah, it's not getting it.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.480]   Right.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.380]   And you know, all kinds of horrible stuff like that happens.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:31.580]   So now the OS vendors have had to put up their own websites and and when you say first connect, they try and load a page on their own site and see if it's if it's the page they're expecting.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.780]   And if it isn't, they don't switch the net connection.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.080]   They put up that little box that says you should log into this site now.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   Oh, that's what's happening.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.580]   That's interesting.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:46.980]   There was a couple of years back where the page that Apple was serving for that went down and every.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.480]   iPhone everywhere suddenly thought that that all Wi-Fi's needed to be logged into even when they didn't.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.680]   So that this is it.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.380]   It's horrible single point of failure.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.780]   So they they fixed that, but Google does the same thing.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:07.380]   If you if you actually look at the packets, Google tries to someone Google site and then you get that little idea.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.380]   Notification.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.880]   Look, so the problem is that these people are explicitly breaking the protocol on purpose.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:21.980]   Now back when students have been in this protocol, he did define a way for the them to put up a dialogue box along the way.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.880]   But the only thing that ever implemented that was the Mac OS version that he shipped.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.980]   No one else implemented that.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.580]   So that wasn't actually didn't end up as part of the spec.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:40.080]   And so we start with this every internet half internet connection points you try and connect to align to you and your phone has to sit there and sniff it and try and work it out before it does anything.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.480]   So the term for this is captive portal detection.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   Captive portal.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.680]   Yes.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:51.180]   Well, yeah, captive portal is a euphemism for crappy middle box that intersects your connection.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:58.080]   So you'd be exactly your your a captive of the of the Wi-Fi you're connecting to.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.780]   So I have to say Google or Android does a better job of this than the iPhone.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.680]   The iPhone will often silently join it.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.280]   Never give you a notice that you're on this.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.180]   Not necessarily pull up the web page, which I think it's supposed to do.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.680]   They do they do do that.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.980]   I think they will they will put up the thing now.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.080]   It takes forever.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.780]   No, it's slow and it takes forever.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:26.380]   Well, the phone is Google puts up a dialogue box in your notifications that says you need, you know, tap this to log in.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.080]   And it usually does it a lot faster.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.180]   I I you know, because Lisa uses an iPhone and I use Android and almost always Lisa.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.680]   Now, maybe she was sitting there going, I don't know what's going on.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   I'm not getting any internet.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.780]   And and I said, yeah, you just, you know, wait.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.680]   Yeah, we'll pop up.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:50.580]   But also a lot of those captive portals are crap and they're running on like some pulling little piece of nonsense on the router.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.080]   Right.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.680]   And so they're not serving a very good web page.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.780]   I've had that like, where was it?
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.080]   How does it every hotel?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:02.380]   Yeah, hotels and railway stations are particularly bad at this because they're like, oh, somebody sold them a box that they can serve as to people.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.680]   It's like, I'm in a railway station.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.780]   I want to be here for three minutes, but I want to know when the trains leave.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.780]   The ports do the same thing.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.080]   And I have to wait four minutes for you to connect to it.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.280]   You're not actually serving me here.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.280]   Yes.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.080]   So, yes, you're New York subways now have have some Wi-Fi and you've got 30 seconds.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.380]   I just want to do one thing.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.480]   I just want to send out one.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.580]   No, you need to long into the port authorities, a special web page.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.080]   So, you know, there is a camp.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.880]   The EFF has a campaign for this saying make Wi-Fi actually open, but.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   Yeah, that's going to happen.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.580]   What's going to happen?
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.780]   In the old days, what do we call it?
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.780]   Not gun running.
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.080]   What was it called when you when you drove down the street and found Wi-Fi?
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.580]   We're driving.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.580]   Go on.
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:43.980]   We're running.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.080]   I'm like going to run.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.280]   I get that on the hard drive.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   That's good.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.080]   Those were the good old days, huh?
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.880]   Another person has a router.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.580]   Wow.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.980]   We need we are in the fraternity together.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.680]   Well, now Comcast is doing this, aren't they with XFINITY?
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.080]   Oh, God.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.680]   That's not the nightmare.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   I accidentally signed into one of those once and it meant that every time I went out and
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   popped from now on.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.680]   Well, just forget it.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.280]   Just forget it.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.580]   And half of them are down.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.380]   So basically it makes your phone unusable as you wander the world because they've joined
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.680]   in XFINITY hotspot that's not doing anything.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.480]   Well, I have one answer here, folks.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   I just received it.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.480]   Google Fi.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.180]   Oh, you got your karma.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.780]   I got my karma.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.080]   Oh, it's got it's a.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.180]   That's cute.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.380]   It's very nice looking.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.380]   I went down and they were nice enough to give me one at the karma offices in New York.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.980]   Oh, and karma's very.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.180]   So it's it's this simple little.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.580]   So I'll turn it on here.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.480]   This was a Kickstarter, right?
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.580]   Were they I don't know.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.880]   Karma's been around for a while.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.080]   My grandma go is what you got.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.120]   So the deal is that you pay a same thing as five and this is what you only pay for the
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.080]   band for the for the gigs you use.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.780]   No monthly play.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.280]   You buy this for $149, but then there's no monthly plan whatsoever.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.680]   You just pay for the gigs used.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.880]   What's really interesting about karma is that it's social.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.880]   So let's say that you.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.680]   Kevin sign up for a karma account and you don't own one of these when you go sit in the airport.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.280]   And somebody around you has a karma on.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   You go in and you use some of your gigs against through their karma.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.680]   I won't even notice.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.180]   So I don't even notice.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.380]   That's yeah.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:32.440]   Yeah, so I won't notice and and but because I've made mine available to you, I get rewarded with, I don't know, like 10
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.140]   makes or something.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:44.000]   And when I bring new customers on, if I if I use the code on on Twitter and you sign up because of me, I get like a hundred
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.340]   makes or something like this yet.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.640]   Yeah, I've used it.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.540]   A fast rent.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.340]   It's called it's rent.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:49.840]   Got you.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.440]   It's rent.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.740]   They and well because they've got to negotiate with the other companies and that will come.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:02.380]   And and you know, I think the others will wise up and realize that they can't just sell you their own stuff because I canceled my Verizon, my
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.780]   because it was wildly expensive.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:09.480]   And I was I was pissed off of spending all this money on an in case use that I didn't use.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.280]   So how much it's 149 bucks and then 10 bucks a day.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.380]   What's the battery life like?
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.880]   Because the challenge with all these Wi-Fi type things is they think, Oh, we'll make it really small.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.580]   And it's like, no, make it a little bit bigger.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.580]   It's in my bag anyway.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.280]   Yeah, I have.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:21.880]   I have.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.180]   I have.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.580]   It goes on standby.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.480]   It would be nice if it lasted 24 or 12 hours, even.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.880]   Yeah, I forget.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.280]   I forget what they what they promised it is.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.580]   But it's it's so far as it's.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:39.880]   It's just in a screen, you know, I could you could put a battery of the size of the thing that I came right anyway in it and it's it would still last a lot better.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.580]   But instead of like it also, yeah, the other truth is I have in my bag.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.380]   I have my now I have my Google Fi battery and I just plug it into there if I need to.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.980]   Yeah, that's the start carrying those batteries around.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.680]   Yeah, no, I do anyway.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.880]   We're all carrying a thousand million.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   I think I'm buying one built in.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.080]   So here's the camera, which is actually a battery that also does that.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.780]   Well, that's a good idea.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.780]   So here's the deal.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.780]   Well, you actually are you need one of those cases for the karma that is a battery.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:19.280]   Each time each time you're you share the referral link, your friend gets $10 in their account and you get $10.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.080]   Wow.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.680]   Each karma connection is available up to eight devices, either your own or people around you.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.880]   Karma ties data to the person, not the device, a feature they call social bandwidth.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   This allows each person to only share access to their network, never their data.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   So everyone picks up their own tab.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   Each time someone hops on your karma connection, both parties get 100 megabytes.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.480]   You for sharing and then forgetting started.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.280]   How much is data?
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.480]   Is it 10 bucks a gigabyte?
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.280]   14 bucks a gig.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.280]   Oh, it's a little pricey.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.880]   But but if you buy that's if you want to buy one gig.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.880]   If you buy 10 gigs, it's $99.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   And again, after that is it how much per like then you buy it in chunks each time.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   You buy another 10 gigs.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.680]   Ah, because because because you never expires because it's not that yes.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   It's just you know, so I've got like 20.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.080]   There was a special half off deal right before I got this.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.680]   And so what the heck I got 20 gigs waiting for me and I can take three years to use it.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.280]   Right.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:23.480]   Well matter, battery life, nine days on sleep mode, six to eight hours in use.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.480]   Yeah, it's like the other one.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.880]   I like to double, you know, so maybe it's low two to three bags down peak 10.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.680]   Megs download six to eight Megs peak 25.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.080]   Megs.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.080]   So that's the karma story.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.880]   I'd like to see.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.080]   I'd like to see that.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.080]   You know what?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.880]   I'm going to order one and yeah, and you can let me know.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.480]   I'll let you know.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.680]   So I think the point for the both this and Google five.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:02.680]   I don't want to say what Google five is that what they are pressing the industry to do is to forget this ridiculous arbitrage we are forced into where we buy things we don't use like the cable.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.880]   The cable industry does that right.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.680]   How many channels do I never use?
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:16.880]   And how much bandwidth on this stuff and how many minutes of phone calls back in the day did I pay for that I never used and that's what's BS and that's what these companies are pressing the industry to get out.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.080]   So I just bought one because I'm a sucker and I tweeted my code out.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   So if you want to get 10 bucks off, well, we'll see.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   I will it would be nice.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.280]   I got like 50 bucks.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.680]   I got 50 bucks.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.280]   But I did tweet the referral.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.880]   So if you if you before you if you do want to buy you get 10 bucks off, go to my Twitter.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:42.680]   But so we'll we'll we'll reserve judgment on the karma, but I think it sounds like it's a good deal.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.880]   It's better than the horizon.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.680]   I'm trying to see.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.880]   So so this is what connects something this week.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:55.280]   Rosie, my wife said she was fed up with her phone and wanted a new phone and was like, okay, yeah, you've had it a couple of years.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.280]   Let's let's see.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.400]   And so we went through is like, well, what do you want from your phone that you haven't got from that one?
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:07.800]   And she basically said, I want more space to read with bigger type because, you know, she's her, her eyesight's not wonderful.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.480]   And, you know, that problem too.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.880]   And so I said, oh, well, you could get your next six and she looked at that and said, no, I want something bigger than that.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.680]   It's like what?
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.880]   They don't make phones bigger than that.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.480]   Then I then I had a brainwave that said, tablet, there's the Nexus seven.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.880]   Yeah, which I can get for $150 now.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.480]   I'll get you one of those.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.480]   And so now she's got, you know, she's got something this big to read on, which will fit in her purse and battery last of day.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.080]   And she's a big fan of phone calls.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   And then you put Skype on it or what do you have on it?
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.480]   Hangouts.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.880]   What do you use for the phone calls?
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:42.080]   Hangouts and the Hangouts dialer with the Google voice.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.680]   That's as much like a phone as anything, right?
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.880]   The annoying part is there's two things that are annoying.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:54.080]   One is that Facebook does not respect the make the text larger setting on Android.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:00.680]   So you have to run some third party hack to increase the text size in Facebook, which is, you know, classic.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:08.480]   And the other Facebook thing that is what you call it, WhatsApp doesn't work on tablets because it insists you have a phone number.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.080]   Oh, that's so yeah, that's right.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.680]   Which is crazy, which means there's a number of things like that.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.480]   There's going to be more things like that, I think.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.280]   So the SMS is get through with Hangouts.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:25.680]   But the WhatsApp messages don't get through and Facebook, you have to like jewelry rig with random hacks to make the text bigger.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.880]   So I got one other question for phones on you guys.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.480]   Yes.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:36.880]   You too, you too, Jason, which one should I lust after if anyone, the one plus two or the new Moto X?
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.280]   Yeah, that was my next question.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.880]   That was the other question was, I'm not buying you a phone this week because there's a whole bunch of new stuff coming out.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   Right.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.680]   Jason, this is thrown to me.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.080]   Don't get OK, here's the argument against.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.400]   I'm sorry, Jason.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.280]   No, you're saying.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.080]   Let me say the no, no, I'm going to buy time answer and then I'll come back with my answer.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.680]   This is the argument against the one plus two.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.560]   I'm a one plus two fan.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.480]   The argument in favor of, in my opinion, is it's a type C connector.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.880]   The argument against no NFC.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.480]   It is the same big one.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.080]   It's the same screen as last year, which is not a great screen, but it's OK.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.280]   They have improved the camera, but we haven't seen it yet.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.080]   So we're going to have to see what the camera is like.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.560]   To me, the biggest issue is crap customer service.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.920]   If you have a problem with it, you're out of luck.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.800]   So that's the biggest issue to me.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.240]   I talked to their event in Times Square on Friday.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.200]   Well, you might know someone that might help you.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.800]   We'll see.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.920]   So but that's to me.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.080]   I now the battery life is going to be awesome.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.720]   They're increasing at 10% over last year.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.560]   Last year's model with the same screen got 20 hours easy for me.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.200]   It's the dual SIM matter to you at all.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.640]   For international.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.960]   It shouldn't matter to you either unless you're in China.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.000]   Where would you use dual sim like crazy?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.360]   Yeah, it's what they had to do it.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.280]   India and China, because you move around from area to area.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.960]   And so you need both Sims.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:07.400]   I don't think you could use dual Sims like OK, I have a German sim and I leave it
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.800]   in my phone when I'm in America.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.920]   I don't know if that would work.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   Maybe you would.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.160]   I don't know what that was.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.440]   This is two phone numbers, right?
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.560]   Yeah, I don't know how that would work.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.320]   So what about the Moto X?
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.480]   I think that's going to be the one to get.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.120]   Really? Oh, yeah.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.640]   Now or the G.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.080]   So here's one way to go with go cheap.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.520]   The G is basically like last year's Moto X.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.520]   It seems to me.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.720]   But cheap, it's 160 bucks.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.440]   Is it little?
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.400]   Is it like little?
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:34.880]   Yes, little.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.040]   It's only 720 P.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.640]   It's a smaller screen.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.240]   But there were people complaining that the
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.360]   iPhone is big.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:41.880]   Yes.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.440]   So the little phone fans haven't got anything.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.000]   So that's so the G would be the answer for them.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   OK.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.880]   Then the Moto X is going to be bigger.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:53.760]   They really made the, you know, one of the reason people liked Moto X is because it
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.000]   was 4.7 inches, the original one.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.240]   Then they went for 5.2.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.200]   So the one plus two is five and a half inches.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.600]   The new Moto X Pure Edition, which is the only one you can get in the US, is 5.7 inches.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   And then they did the thing that everybody does.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.400]   They went to a quad display, quad HD display, which means battery life's going to suck again.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Oh, oh.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.200]   Because the more pixels you push, the worse the battery life gets, right?
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   Right.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   That was the thing that was putting me off getting Rosie a new phone was that, you know,
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   her problem wasn't that the pixels were 2B.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.400]   It was more, the pixels were too small.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.000]   Right.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.760]   The device wasn't displaying them properly.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.280]   Right.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.200]   So getting even more pixels wouldn't help.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:40.880]   Whereas, you know, this thing's 1080p, which is plenty of pixels, but you have to persuade
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.480]   it to draw big enough that you can read it, which is another little song of dance you
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   have to do.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.720]   Yeah, you have to kind of trick it into that, don't you?
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.200]   But Android does have a way to increase font sizes very easily.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.760]   It does, but as I say, not all that Facebook ignores it.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.400]   So if you're using Facebook, which it was, I had to run some larger thing.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.600]   One more Moto X does use an LCD display this time, which is interesting.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   Not all that.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   So it's not all that so I have to imagine that means some of the cool kind of touchless,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.840]   you know, screen, ambient screen stuff that the old Moto X's do that a lot of people love.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.040]   I'm not sure that you're going to see as much of that here.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:30.240]   Another argument in favor of the OnePlus 2 is 4GB of RAM, which in my experience on Android,
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   more memory does help.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.640]   Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.120]   That helps with speed.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   Okay.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.440]   Argument against maybe Proacon Moot is the Snapdragon 810.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.760]   The phones with the Snapdragon 810s today have been really bad.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.360]   This chip gets too hot.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.480]   The HTC had to underclock in order to get it to operate cool.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.360]   I don't know about the Snapdragon 810.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.080]   Samsung actually avoided it because they couldn't get it to work, although the Samsung X knows
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.560]   that they used in the Galaxy S6 is just as bad or worse.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   So we'll see they have a new variant of the 2.1 variant of the Snapdragon 810.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   So we'll see.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.640]   I do like the various backs, but Moto X does that too.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.120]   No quick charging.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.160]   That's a problem as far as I'm concerned, although if your battery lives 20 hours, maybe that
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.240]   doesn't matter.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.440]   No wireless charging.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:21.040]   I do like wireless, but again, if you're only charging it at night, not as big a deal.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.880]   The Pure Edition will have a 3000 milliamp hour.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.000]   That's a big battery for the Moto X.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.800]   It's too bad we don't get the Play Edition, which is like 36 or 37.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   That's the one I want, right?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.520]   But that's outside the USA.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.520]   Why are they doing that?
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   I don't get it.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.520]   That's weird.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.520]   It's Lenovo.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.520]   They don't.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.520]   I don't know.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.840]   The Pure Edition will be three gigs of RAM.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.360]   There'll be a 64 gig variant.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   That's what you'll want.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.240]   You don't want to do 16 for sure.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.320]   You know, I would say 21 megapixel camera raw raw, except that so does the HTC and that's
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.640]   terrible.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.400]   So the number of megapixels is not.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   It's just unknown.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.120]   We don't know what that camera is going to do.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.080]   I think this is, if you're thinking about getting one of these two phones, I'd wait
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.000]   till it comes out and see what we're feeling.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Yeah, I'd agree.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.560]   Neither of them, to be completely honest, neither of them came out and I was like, "Oh
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.560]   my."
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.520]   No, I think I have to do this.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.680]   This is irresistible.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:23.240]   Even though they're both really priced really well, that's a good price point and something
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.320]   that we're more and more getting conditioned to expect high end specs and performance.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.120]   They're both at a mid-range price.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.600]   Yeah, they're about half the price of the high end stuff.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.360]   But last year with the OnePlus One, you saw what you got and you saw the price that it
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:43.000]   came at and it was hard to deny that that's a really good deal and I should just get one
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.080]   because it's a great deal.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.880]   This year, both of these, they're fine.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.120]   I feel like there's some kind of, I don't know, you have to make, there's a little bit of a
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.560]   trade-off as a result and not nearly as an aesthetic people.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.600]   I think a lot of people should look at the Moto G, believe it or not.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.000]   Well, Moto G is the most popular Moto, Motorola phone in the past couple of years.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.680]   It's their highest selling phone.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.000]   So it makes sense.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   So Leo, you're still, like, I, there was a sale on the, what's the little tiny Moto,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   the ear thing?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.200]   Oh, no, don't get the hint.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.680]   They've replaced that.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   Anyway, already.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:25.040]   So I did order it and then I'm returning it because I didn't open it because I thought,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.760]   I looked at it and I thought, no, it's not going to stay in my, I wear weird ears.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   Nothing fits in my ear.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.080]   Well, it's not going to work in weird ears, that's for sure.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.960]   So let's see, flip shell, should I get a flip shell?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.160]   No, we don't actually get to order this down, are you?
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.240]   Yeah, actually.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.120]   I like, I like the Moto, the last Moto G.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.600]   I can get graved.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.840]   Let's see.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.040]   Take that, Jeff.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   Okay.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.720]   Put that on the back.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.720]   That'll be nice.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   That'll be good.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.720]   Memory.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.880]   Now this is the key on this one is you want to go with the 16 gig, especially on the Moto
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   G.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   Two gig ram.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   One of their options.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.760]   I can have a greeting when it signs on.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.760]   I like Moto Maker.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.600]   I'm glad that they've kept that around.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.520]   And I can do seashells.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.160]   Hello, Leo.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.800]   That's so stupid.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.200]   How about hello handsome?
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   Oh, man.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.760]   Yeah, now I'm happy.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.400]   Hello handsome.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.360]   254 bucks for that 16 gig version.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.200]   16 is a little light.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.680]   That would be the one thing that would really worry me on this.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.000]   It is light.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.600]   Our wife has a 16 gig Moto X, the first one.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.080]   And is always running out of room because of photos and videos, videos primarily.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.760]   So you can make different designs.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:49.840]   Moto Maker is great, not anymore in the US, of course.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.480]   The G in a way to me hits the sweet spot for most normal people.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.720]   I was surprised the number of high-end geeks who also have the G in love it.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:06.600]   It's water resistant, 13 megapixel camera with dual flash, color bouncing flash.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   It's a 5 inch 720p display.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.280]   Life is a good size.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.920]   They say all day battery.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.280]   I wish they'd be better on these battery life.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.720]   Oh, slot for an SD card.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   I didn't see that.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   With 32 gig up to 32 gigs.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.480]   All of them have SD cards.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.960]   That's funny because none of them feature phones.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   Really?
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   One plus is an SD card.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   No, no, no, sorry.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   All of Motorola's newest.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   This is the X.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.400]   The X has a two yes.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   Yes.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   Up to 128.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.080]   Everybody else is turning their back on it.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.120]   The rumor is that even Samsung on the Note 5 will.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.840]   I suppose if I watched all about Android every Tuesday night on this network, I would know
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.240]   this stuff.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   Blog.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.080]   Posted by that great guy, Jason Howell.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.480]   I would know this stuff.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.480]   Keep it coming.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.320]   Kevin Tofel apparently says that this Nesys Sisk's camera is the same camera as the Moto
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   G.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   No, Moto G.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   Moto G.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.680]   Well, I'm happy.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.240]   This is not a bad camera.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.640]   That would be OK.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.320]   It's not bad.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.720]   It's not amazing, but it's not bad.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.680]   What's the best phone camera?
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   A lot.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.160]   The Galaxy S6.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.400]   Yeah, between that and the LG G4 right now.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   And the iPhone 6.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.120]   Yeah, I was underwhelmed by the G4.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.280]   I know that Miriam and lots of people really are crazy about the G4.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.280]   I was not impressed.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.920]   The G6, that's 6, blows me away.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.280]   The iPhone 6 is pretty good, although it's only half the megapixel.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   And then, of course, there's Nokia.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.720]   If you want to get a Windows phone, those Nokia cameras are very good.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.960]   How come you don't have an iPhone, Jeff?
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.720]   You seem like an iPhone guy.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.720]   No.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.320]   I live Laveta Google.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   I love you.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.120]   I got my Chromebooks.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.200]   My Chromebook microphone is not working right now, so I can't do Hangouts on it.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.960]   Miriam practically slapped me because I said I like the iPhone 6 camera.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.320]   She says, no iOS.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.320]   OIS.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.320]   Optical image stabilization.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.320]   She said, you must have that.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.320]   I don't notice the loss of that.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.600]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   We've got lots more.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.360]   Kevin Marks is here joining us from the Mozilla headquarters in San Francisco where he's getting
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.200]   ready for an event tonight.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   Tell us about that.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.600]   So tonight we've got an event called Homebrew website club, which we have every two weeks.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.080]   We normally have it at Missouri and San Francisco.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.200]   We also have locations in other cities.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:42.040]   Tonight, there's one in Portland and there was one in Yertaburg in Sweden, which is in
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.840]   Gothenburg if you want to say in English, which has obviously already finished.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   It's very big.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   It's very big.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.840]   It's very big.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   It's very big.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   It's very big.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.320]   But also we've had them in Chicago, New York.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:59.480]   Basically, it's based on the original Homebrew computing club idea, which was where famously
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:05.360]   the Apple was invented, where you get together and talk about what you've built on your website,
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.640]   what you'd like to build on your website and work together on that.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.160]   So it's part of the Indie Web stuff.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.120]   We've been doing it for probably 18 months now, maybe a couple of years.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.920]   We normally get a handful of people coming around and trying stuff out.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.600]   The number varies a fair bit.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.200]   I enjoy it and I recommend people come along if they're interested.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:35.080]   In San Francisco tonight, 530 at Mozilla, Portland 530.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.560]   Look up on the indiewebcamp.com website and this is the bottom of the page.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.920]   Jeff Jarvis also here from City University of New York where he teaches journalism.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.640]   I have a lot of journalism stories we can talk about.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.080]   It was kind of an interesting time last few weeks.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.000]   I'm sure you got her.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And more.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   New York Times.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.680]   The sad end of the line for the Gray Lady or not.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.120]   Anyway, we'll talk about some more stuff like that.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.080]   But first, can I talk about JustWorks?
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.880]   JustWorks.com.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.180]   If you're a business person, you know that one of the things your employees want and
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:23.360]   expect getting their paychecks on time and an HR department that actually provides HR.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:29.560]   I know this because I finally realized I had to go get some help when Dane complained
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.560]   to me.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.200]   He still paid me for last month.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.760]   Sorry about that.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.280]   I forgot.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.280]   JustWorks.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.440]   Running a successful business is hard enough.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.200]   And the thousands of little details can sometimes make it feel overwhelming.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.880]   Plus, nobody really starts a business because they dream of doing HR, dealing with paperwork.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.800]   JustWork helps you do the things you love in your business and they'll take care of benefits,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.880]   payroll, and HR.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.320]   I like it.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.720]   With JustWorks, you're equipped to take care of your team.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.440]   They'll process your payroll automatically.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.960]   They'll set up team benefits online.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   You can even save on healthcare because you're part of a larger group.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.040]   It's just that simple.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.040]   JustWorks.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.120]   And Geeks love JustWorks because they've got software that helps you do all this.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.880]   Automate payroll and compliance as easy as can be.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.320]   Grow your business, not your busy work.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.320]   It takes a couple of minutes to set this up.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.720]   Literally, if you start right now, you'll be done in a minute or two.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.760]   Just go to JustWorks.com, use the offer code Twig at checkout.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.080]   You'll get 15% off your first year of services.

[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.320]   Imprint, reboot, hundreds more.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.360]   Startups love JustWorks.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.360]   I want you to try it.

[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.160]   JustWorks.com.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.280]   Make sure you mention Twig.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.560]   If you buy, use Twig as the offer code because that's going to save you 15% for the first
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.560]   year of your account.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.320]   Visit JustWorks.com and the offer code Twig.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.440]   We thank you so much for the support of this week in Google.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.640]   Jeff Jarvis, Kevin Marks.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.000]   Facebook results are out breaking news.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:17.680]   Amazing numbers, they're amazing numbers.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.040]   Monthly active users.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.040]   What do you think?
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.040]   1.49 billion.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   What?
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.000]   They couldn't do another 100,000.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.800]   Oh, so close to.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.560]   How many people are on the internet?
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.960]   That's got to be everybody.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960]   Ten billion.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.160]   10 billion on the internet.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   No, that's the plan.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   You have a 10 million to get to 1.5.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   10 million.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.160]   First 3 billion.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   First 3 billion.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.160]   It's massive.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   It's not Australian coming.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.160]   But they're close.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   That's close.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   That's .01 billion.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   That's all they need.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.960]   800 million people use WhatsApp.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   That's amazing itself.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.040]   Wow, that one blows me away.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.600]   Remember when it was a big deal that Facebook had half a billion people?
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.280]   That wasn't so long ago.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.760]   WhatsApp has 800 million.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.800]   Messenger Facebook Messenger.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   Big success.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   700 million.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   Facebook forced that.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   Instagram.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.440]   You know, I thought they said 300 million last month, so it's still 300 million.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.280]   So maybe not growing.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.680]   One and a half billion searches a day.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.200]   A billion people getting online through internet.org.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.280]   Or I think all offer could get online.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.680]   They're like homes passed.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   What's Facebook groups?
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.680]   I didn't even know that existed.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   850 million people do.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   I don't know.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   Leo doesn't.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.880]   No, it's just the global groups.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.880]   It's not quite pages.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.240]   It's somewhere between the pages.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.880]   Basically it's a chat room that you can put together on Facebook.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   Oh.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.400]   Yeah, like every one of our classes at school has a Facebook group.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.960]   Oh, I never heard of it.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   The one I didn't, you know, I forget about is Facebook events.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   You've probably got one that you don't know about.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   Yeah, probably do.
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.160]   450 million people use events.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.600]   That just shows you, you know, we're geeks and we kind of turn up our noses as things
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   like this.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.800]   But real people go, no, it's Facebook, everything.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   It does everything you need.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.960]   40 million small businesses are using pages.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.360]   I like Mark.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:15.000]   In 1876, the year the first telephone call was made, there were 1.49 billion people on
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   the earth.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.120]   Now we've got that many people in Facebook.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.640]   Where's the money part?
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.040]   Go to the other link that I put in the.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.360]   So, this is the obvious Twitter box where they go in about mouse and then they pop up.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.040]   Where's the money part?
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.040]   The money part.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.440]   The earnings came in at 50 cents a share, 4.04 billion in revenue, beating the forecast
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   by three cents a share.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   Okay.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:51.440]   Nonetheless, stock fell in 5% and after hours, mainly because higher expenses, they say,
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:57.000]   you know, it's really become the case that the stock market buys on the run-up.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Yes.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   To the quarterly results.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.200]   And then whatever they are, sells, so nearly average.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.640]   I mean, average daily users came in at 968 million.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.720]   Look at this one.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.520]   This to me is the number that really matters.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:20.560]   We mentioned 1.49 billion monthly active users on mobile 1.31 billion.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.560]   Mobile is Facebook is mobile.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   Is mobile.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.880]   Plus, get this one.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.800]   Engagement came in at 46 minutes per day on average.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   Wow.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   That's more than YouTube.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   Instagram Messenger.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.440]   Wow.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.440]   That's a pretty linear graph, Kevin Marks.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.680]   That's a kind of graph where you could pretty easily predict the future.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.200]   It's almost a straight line growth.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.240]   It's interesting because I remember them getting nervous as they were approaching the number
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   of people online.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.920]   Do you remember Mark giving that to you?
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.600]   That's why we just stopped counting mouse.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.680]   You just start counting interactions or something.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.240]   But I guess they carried it right away.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.960]   Internet.org does matter so much to them strategically because they've got to get more
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.960]   people to see on the internet.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   You've got to see them.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.720]   Well, how many people are online?
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.640]   What is the number?
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.680]   I think it's in the 3 billion now and next another 3 billion coming.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.680]   Okay.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   That's not right.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.600]   A billion of them Chinese.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:24.560]   Facebook daily active users in millions daily is well over 800 million.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.560]   Daily.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.360]   That's kind of it.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.320]   Expenses came in at 2.77 billion up 82% from the same period last year.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.640]   So that's what scared Wall Street.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   Right?
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   That's what scared them a little bit.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   But geez.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   Well, why are they up so much?
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.640]   That's a lot of money.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.120]   82% increase in expenses.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.440]   Must be some one time stuff.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   Acquisitions?
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.360]   No, I don't know.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   So Q2 growth, Twitter versus Facebook.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:57.920]   Twitter gained 2 million users in the second quarter, Facebook 50 million.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.880]   Mobile advertising, 76% of total ad revenue for the quarter.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.880]   Wow.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   Nobody else can figure out.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.880]   No one else can figure out.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   No one is still in that.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   No one is still in that.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.880]   It's killing us.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   76%.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.920]   Did they break that down at all?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.120]   Into what kinds of ads?
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.320]   Because they've got different kinds of ads.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   No.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   Okay.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.480]   Because a lot of it was apping stores at one point.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.800]   But I'm not sure if that's still working for them.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   Wasn't that the hot thing for a while?
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.480]   Those app ads?
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   And then it was over.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.200]   Well, I'm sure it's over.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.600]   But I think I suspect it was.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   I didn't see.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   I don't see him anymore.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   My Facebook feed.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   Do you still see him?
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   No, I don't.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   It went away.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   I don't read my Facebook feed much.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   Listen, look.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.680]   I decided to go into Facebook.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.520]   I dove back in.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.880]   I really dove back in and got serious about Facebook.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:48.680]   And because I realized I've got three times as many followers on Facebook as I have on
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.800]   Twitter.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.160]   And so I took a seriously joined in and I'm loving it.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   I got to say, it's very good.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   You know, a few things here.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.080]   It's the same meme will come by right now.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.960]   I cannot see the picture of that sad lion.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.320]   That poor lion is having me nuts.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   You know what though?
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.760]   That tells you, I think that that's not a bad thing.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.560]   That's what everybody's consumed with.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.440]   So as long as it's accurately reflecting what's on people's minds right now, I can live with
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   that.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.880]   I think is seeing the video that was viral a year ago.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.880]   Yes, I agree.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.880]   I agree.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.640]   I talked to the head of the feed and you know, you think there's some magic formula of water
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.600]   to this and he just said, yeah, we're working on that.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.040]   You know, I feel that they've gotten better.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.440]   I feel like they've gotten better.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   They have gotten much better.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:44.040]   I mean, remember the days when scoble would take over your entire feed.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.640]   I must unfollowed him.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   I don't know.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.640]   I know.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   I still there.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.640]   I was thinking about this afterwards.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.400]   What I wish is when they do bring something back, make it obvious why you're doing that.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.200]   Because what they're doing, he said, we're doing it because there's some new activity.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.720]   But then I've got to go digging for what why is this here?
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.720]   It's mysterious.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.840]   And they could say that we just got a sudden boost of comments or some new comments.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.360]   I see a lot of Jeff, whatever for some reason because I must have given them a signal that
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.160]   I like your posts because I see a lot of you.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.160]   What do you got?
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.160]   Is that a mad?
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.400]   That's a suggested post.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   That's an ad.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.400]   That's a giant post it.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   That's weird.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.400]   Oh, that's an ad.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   And is that an app installer?
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.520]   I mean, it's like, I wouldn't click this thing, but I don't know.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.360]   What is it for?
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.360]   In vision.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360]   I don't know.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.360]   You've got your design process.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.360]   Trust me, I'm one.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   No, I don't think so.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.160]   And I'm getting one for Happify, which I think is a website.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.600]   And my ad.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.360]   Stop negative thoughts.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:45.400]   So I wonder what that this compares with media company or with Google.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.360]   The RPU, I love saying that.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.800]   The RPU, what's that?
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.200]   Average revenue per user.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   Oh, how much?
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.600]   Two dollars and seventy six cents.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.400]   Two dollars and seventy six cents.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.840]   Is that a year or quarter?
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.840]   Oh, that's for the quarter.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.840]   That's for the quarter.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.920]   So that means they're making, you know, maybe ten dollars a year on you.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   That's a lot of money if you think about it, especially when you have 1.5 billion users.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   That's making up on volume.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.520]   Ten bucks a year, though, is what they make on you.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   Wow.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.360]   That's what you pay for that service.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:23.760]   The company spent 1.17 billion dollars on R&D for the quarter.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   R&D.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.360]   Up from only 4.92 million in the year ago period.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   That's what happened.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360]   That's where it is.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.960]   Well, which is investment.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.600]   They're trying to figure out how to do a better job.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.520]   And they're doing Oculus and they're doing other things.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.960]   They're developing, they're investing.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   It's impressive.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:46.960]   I mean, it's a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell of a hell.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:53.680]   I just read it from people who talk about it and talk about what a well-managed company it is and how good it is to work there and that kind of stuff. So it's taken some of the mojo for old daddy Google.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:49:04.000]   I feel like, yeah, I feel like for a while I was hating myself when I visited Facebook and lately I actually enjoy it. I love it.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   What's Google's output?
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.400]   How does that compare?
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   I don't know. It's going to be so different, though, Kevin, because you just don't have the same kind of Google just has incredible volume of browsers.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   Right.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   But, you know, the thing is to compare the ARPOO of, oh, here we go.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.400]   Okay.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.400]   So this is in 2014.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.400]   Oh, $45 a quarter.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.400]   What?
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.400]   In 2014.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   So here's Google's massive ARPOO.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:30.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   Gee, have?
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   We just said $10 a year for Facebook. Google's doing $45 a quarter.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   Now this is old data.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.400]   As you said, 2014.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   This is quarter?
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   That's per quarter.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   Google's doing okay.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   This was when Twitter--
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   And Facebook's then at 724.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   And Twitter at--
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.400]   That's three and a half.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   But you said it was two now.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   Is this per year?
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   That's annualized.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.400]   Okay.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   You won.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.400]   Oh, this is annualized.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   Okay.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   Is it annualized?
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   Okay.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   So the seven there is now 10 or 11 for Facebook?
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.400]   Well, not quite 10.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.400]   So what's an ARPOO for a time-make or something?
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   You know, it's interesting because people complain about how Facebook is and truths and stuff.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.400]   But if you use Facebook as a service, how much would you pay a year if you wanted to?
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   If you didn't want to have Facebook gather information on your Google or anybody else,
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   how much would you pay per year for what you get from them?
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.400]   And I think 10 bucks would be cheap.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.400]   Oh.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   Oh.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   And 45 would be cheap for Google.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   Ah.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.400]   Come on.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.400]   Come on.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   Come on.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.400]   Now I can do four bucks.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.400]   Anything less than five bucks a month.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.400]   Versus what you paid a Comcast for what?
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.400]   For just bits.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   No value added whatsoever.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.400]   I was paying five bucks a month for Posthaven.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.400]   So I see an article here from Giga Home, may it rest in peace?
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:08.400]   Estimate, estimating 2010 New York Times ARPOO of $170.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   Wow.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   But you have far...
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   They have a lot fewer poos.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   The poos.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.400]   And that's also, is that user as a subscriber or user as in...
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   Did you do it?
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   ...let's say website, ever.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.400]   You know, the user becomes weird in that case.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.400]   It costs $600 to subscribe to the New York Times for a year.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.400]   So they're saying only four times as many people look at it and pay for it, which seems unlikely.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.400]   I don't know.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.400]   I can't.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   Don't ask math questions.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   We're...
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   You can do that in your head.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.400]   We have to think.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   No, it's the...
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   This is the way ARPOO is kind of messy metric because it makes sense for...
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:49.400]   It does make sense for Comcast because you've got a customer who's paying you regularly.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   But for something like Facebook or Google, it's a bit weirder.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:57.400]   But in some ways more important because it's a question of, well, am I able to monetize
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.400]   that $1.49 billion?
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.400]   And so it's a pretty important question.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   I think Facebook's success in mobile.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.400]   If I were the stock market, I'd be jumping for joy.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   I'm stunned.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.400]   This is...
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.400]   As far as I'm concerned, that's a buy opportunity.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   Because...
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.400]   I might even do that myself.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.400]   That's impressive.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   That is really impressive.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   Okay.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:25.400]   So there you go, quarterly results in for Facebook and...
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   There it is.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   So someone says in the chat room, "We do we do...
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   The company we do pay annually is Amazon.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   We buy pay them for...
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   100 bucks a year."
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   And that's just for second-day shipping.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   And if you...
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   And if you...
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   And if you...
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   And you say, "How can we pay it?"
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.400]   Yeah, happily.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   And Zen some TV.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.400]   I like the TV, actually.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.400]   The Prime...
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.400]   The...
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   The Prime...
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400]   The...
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   The...
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   The...
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.400]   The...
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.400]   The...
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.400]   It doesn't play on Android, which is a kind of pain in the bum.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.400]   I can't...
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   I can't watch Prime on my Android.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.400]   Oh, I know.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   The Prime is...
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.400]   So I have to use the built-in app on the TV to watch...
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.400]   Yeah, me too.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   Just kind of annoying.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   Plus the apps are very different.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.400]   Some TV apps allow you to buy stuff, some don't.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.400]   It's very weird.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   It's unpredictable, what you're gonna get.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.400]   I'm sure you talked yesterday about stage fright, Justin.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:23.040]   This is the very scary vulnerability on about 950 million Android devices that can be literally
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.400]   owned by an MMS message.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.400]   Well, the...
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   The amount of earnings depends on the version, I think.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   Okay.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   It's...
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   I think it's...
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:38.400]   Jason probably knows slightly more than this, but I think around 4.2 they started scrambling
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   memory, which made it much harder to actually take it over with the buffer overrun, but you
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.400]   can still crash it.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:47.400]   That's exactly what Google had said is that anything post...
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:53.400]   Yeah, I think it's 4.4 has more checks in place, still possible.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   And stage fright at its core is system level stuff.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   So just using Hangouts is kind of like the delivery mechanism.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.400]   That's just one example of how...
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   Without even reading, by the way, the MMS...
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.400]   In fact, you might only see that you received an MMS.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.400]   Right.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.400]   You may never even see it because the MMS could activate...
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.400]   Take over your phone and then delete itself.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.400]   Because these messaging apps they auto retrieve, which is an option that you can turn off,
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   by the way.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.400]   When they do that, they might process it for like a screenshot or something like that.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:27.400]   You know, they actually do some churning on that file before you ever even watch it,
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.400]   just to kind of see what it is and pull some information from it.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.400]   What does your patch come in?
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   For an actual takeover, you'd have to craft it for the particular device, I think.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.400]   Yes, because it has to leap to appropriate part of memory.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.400]   So you could probably crash any Android, but to actually do that, you know,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   the Android, but to actually take over the thing, you'll have to have a crafted packet
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.400]   for your particular...
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   We did a deep dive on this on security now, of course, if you want to know more.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.400]   The big issue, really, is that there are many, many Android phones out there running old
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   operating systems, which will never be updated.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.400]   So the challenge is, what can Google do to patch this?
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.400]   Right.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   They could...
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:08.400]   And if the phones are getting some kinds of updates, if they're getting the Google Cloud
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   Services updates or they're getting the app updates, they could patch the app,
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   the sort of the mainline apps to deal with this.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   I hope that that will propagate too, but it is when something is quite...
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   It's pretty hard, yeah.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   There's so many apps.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   Yeah, but there's an 80/20 thing here.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.400]   If the primary one is the MMS thing, then what you do is you...
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   Oh, I see.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   You patch the top ones of that.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   Oh, and this is why there's been a...
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   Yeah, I've seen this over the last couple of years of Google to move.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:43.400]   Many of the Google services out of the system and into the Play Store so that they can update
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   themselves in the Play Store.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   It's an updating thing.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   Also, Google Play Services.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.400]   The other thing they do is, and I've got the name of it, basically there's an API library
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   you can use, which lets you call newer OS books for certain kinds of things, and they patch it
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   onto older OS versions.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   So that means that if I call some new notification thing that only exists in ice cream sandwich
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   and art, they will make that work on the...
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   At least patch something through and not crash on the older version, so you can call it.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   There's the...
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.400]   Who's libraries are deployed through?
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   Here's the workaround.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.400]   I don't think it's such a bad workaround.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:23.400]   If you go into Hangouts, you go into the SMS settings and go down to Advanced, you can
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   turn off automatically retrieve MMS messages.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.400]   That would do it, right?
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.400]   Yeah, whatever your SMS...
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   Or whatever your app of choice is.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   Yeah, I'm in Hangouts, right?
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   But MMS is the issue, so turn that off.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   Right.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.400]   It seems to hit WhatsApp as well.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   Yes, WhatsApp uses the rendering engine.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.400]   I don't know if it does or not.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.400]   Does it do so?
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   It can't not do it.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   Oh, it's part of the stage fright.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.400]   Is that the core?
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.400]   It's the core library here.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   So that's why it's got system level access, because basically it's got a right to chip.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   Everybody uses it.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:03.400]   Although it wouldn't be a hard thing to do if you're WhatsApp to stop doing that.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   Would you not be able to render at all if you turned that off?
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   But they've still got to deploy updates to 800 million people.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   Right.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.400]   They've got the same issue.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   Non-trivial.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   By the way, this has not been seen in the wild, despite the fact that...
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:21.400]   And there's no proof of concept code, because that's being saved for Black Hat or DefCon.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   So it's nothing to freak out about.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   But what it underscores is the difficulty Google has is in with Android being out there
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:38.400]   on so many devices, so many old devices, and really no mechanism for fixing it.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.400]   For fixing those devices.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   Yeah, it's unfortunate because you want to place blame somewhere.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   And in this case, the blame lies partially in Google for creating a system, you know,
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.400]   an open environment that can be...
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   I hate to use the word splintered, but can be divided up in so many different directions
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.400]   that it makes it difficult.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   And then you can also blame the carriers and the other entities that kind of get in the way
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   of updating or decide, "You know what, that's 18 months old.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   I'm not going to update that."
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   So anyone using a year and a half old phone, which is not super duper old, is just kind of
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   screwed.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   It has to have a device that can be affected by this.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   Right.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.400]   Google is about to buy a fake hamburger company.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.400]   Well, it tried to.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.400]   It tried to.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400]   It didn't get them.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.400]   So we're worth more than $200 to $300 million.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.400]   What?
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.400]   It's made from plants.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.400]   Here's the thing.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.400]   I don't like the veggie burgers that try to act like meat.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   Not like the ones that admit their vegetables.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   What if it succeeded?
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   What if it tasted just like a real thing?
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   It would be good for the earth, I think.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.400]   It'd be very good for the earth.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.400]   And for cows.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:53.400]   Never mind the cows on the billboards.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   This is not the mayonnaise one.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.400]   The mayonnaise out of peas.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.400]   I don't know.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.400]   That's actually taking it.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.400]   But remember, didn't Sergey put money into this guy who was making fake muscle material?
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.400]   No, fake.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   That was cloned.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   That was like the last thing muscle.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.400]   It was real muscle.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.400]   It was cloned.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   Okay.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.400]   This is not the cultured beef project.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.400]   This is a company called Impossible Foods.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.400]   They make the Impossible Cheeseburger, which looked like a cheeseburger.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   I don't know if it tastes like a cheeseburger.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.400]   Anybody try one of these?
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.400]   And why is it?
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.400]   Why?
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.400]   Google says you're worth $200 million.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.400]   They say, no, no, we want more.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   I agree with you, Jeff.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   I've had many a veggie burger.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   They failed to satisfy.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.400]   Wendy's is supposed to have one coming out that's like a black bean burger.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400]   I like it.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.400]   I love a black bean burger.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.400]   Black beans?
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.400]   Okay.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.400]   A little low-shey, but I love a lot of them.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.400]   I feel like this is imminent.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.400]   Like this is part of the whole global climate crisis.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.400]   I mean, this is something we've got to solve.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   Eating meat is so inefficient.
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   And yet you're not going to get me away from that steak.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.400]   No way, no how.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.400]   So we've got to solve this.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.400]   So I can still like Germany as you were just in.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.400]   The idea of them going out without meat.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.400]   Oh my God.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.400]   I've never seen a country eat more sausages.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400]   Yes.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   I love them.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400]   I love them.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.400]   Oh, I do, but I just can feel my heart.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.400]   There's probably not much trans fats in this sausage.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400]   Probably okay.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400]   Really?
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   Sausages are okay?
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.400]   It's a bit, that's a Brit talking.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   Brought.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   Brought's British Sausages have lots of healthy, healthy plant material.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   One thing you can say for sausages, it does at least use the whole cow or pig.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   No, but well, well, we've got this, this week in diets, but the whole, well, we've got
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   the whole saturated fat is bad for you thing is gradually being undermined and what they've
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400]   realized is that what was really bad for you is trans fats.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.400]   And so when they try to substitute saturated fat with trans fat, that's when it goes fast.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   Isn't that funny?
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400]   We were killing people with margarine.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   Right, exactly.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   So the sort of German style Italian style sausages, which are basically tubes of pork fat,
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.400]   and nowhere near as bad for you as American style sausages.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400]   Well, good because they're damn delicious.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   I would eat tubes of pork fat all day if I could.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   So Dr. Mom, it's okay if I eat salami.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.400]   Salami is supposed to be pretty good.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   If you ever read me.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:33.400]   Read your, read your, but that's what I was cutting out of my diet and, and pepperoni.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   I love salami.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.400]   The other thing about salami and pepperoni is that you eat like, you know, 10 grams number
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.400]   of time.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400]   You do not eat like, oh, see, that's my salami.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   Well, maybe you cut little bits off it.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   And so that's the other reason it's good for you.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.400]   Whereas if you're, if you're making any breakfast, you do eat like half a pound of them.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.400]   So there's a big difference in the amount of intake you take.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.400]   One of my favorite places in the world is the food of all at Calf Houste's Vestin's
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   Caudé in Berlin.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.400]   It is palatial and the sausage area.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.400]   There's just no end of sausages to pick from.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.400]   You can smell the smokiness of the, the debrachina is my favorite.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   Oh God.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.400]   And just, and just a little bit of mustard on the thing and you dip it, the mustard and
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:23.400]   eat it with a little gritchen and.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:31.400]   Oh, we went to the oldest versed grill in, was it Nuremberg?
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400]   I can't remember.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.400]   Nuremberg would be probably a little Nuremberg versed.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.400]   Oh, and the Nuremberg sausage, you know, there's a battle over whether Nuremberg, maybe this
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   is a little sour.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.400]   But man, they were, they were so, I have a picture I'm going to make you all hungry.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   Oh, they put, but they put it on a sauerkraut.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.400]   So maybe that will turn some people off.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   I don't know.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   It was so good.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.400]   Well, also the hotel breakfast in Germany are like, here's a giant plate of firm sausages.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   Make a server sandwich.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.400]   So you're saying though that I shouldn't stay away from the carbs.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   That's just eat the meat.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   Um, you know, there are, there are diets that say that.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:15.400]   The broad advice that I've got from this is that the Dachshoe pyramid has been misdesigned
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.400]   for about 40 years and it has too much carbs in it.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.400]   And so you want to adjust the balance of, uh, Carl Fatt and protein.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   And the problem is, is that most of the time you diet, you cut the fat, um, you increase
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   the protein a bit and you end up eating more carbs as a ratio.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   So you want to look at the ratio between the three.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.400]   That's the, that's the stuff that I got from the diet.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.400]   So many, and, so many in the chat room lives in Germany says, we don't need a lot of sausages.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.400]   We eat donor.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.400]   It's true.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.400]   There's a Turkish, there's a Turkish donor shop on every corner in Germany.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.400]   That is a true.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.400]   So I'll, I'll agree with you on that.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400]   And I do love a donor.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   This was this sausage.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400]   They looked like those little Nuremberg sausages.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   I can't remember where it was.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.400]   Virst, kuku.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400]   And the beer was good.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400]   But you know what the best part of that was the mustard.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.400]   I never had such a...
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   The mustard is the greatest.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400]   It's just to die for.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400]   So in fact, it is to die for.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.120]   It's the beer you should stay away from though, right?
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.400]   That's the one with the carbs in it.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400]   There you go.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.400]   You can't win.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.400]   Yes, you've only got the little Stein.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.400]   You didn't get the mass one.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   No, she actually warned me.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.400]   The waitress said, no, you don't want that.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400]   They knew.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.400]   They knew ahead of time.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   All right.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400]   Enough with this v. Converse.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   Although that would be a fun show.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.400]   No, yes.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   My son actually is, is already bidding for that show.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.400]   He wants to do a show on cured meats.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.400]   I always wanted to do, open a restaurant that was nothing but
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.400]   stuffed meat things.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.400]   Google is getting stuffed meats.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.400]   What's a stuffed meat?
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   Well, you know, no, no, I mean, meat stuffed into things.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.400]   Dumplings.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   Oh, yes.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.400]   Stop it.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.400]   No, all that stuff.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.400]   [sighs]
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.400]   Google Street View is now mapping pollution.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.400]   Doesn't that make sense?
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.400]   They have cars going everywhere.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.400]   They can put sensors in the cars.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   That makes sense.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400]   That's what makes me wonder.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   That's what makes me wonder.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.400]   What if Google had a deal with UPS or the Postal Service to put
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.400]   sensors on all their vehicles?
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   What could they learn?
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   This is big data.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:27.400]   Let's have everything collecting data all the time.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.400]   The initial trial was in Denver.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   Three cars with air quality sensors drove around for 750 hours.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   It was part of pollution all the time.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.400]   Yeah, I know.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400]   Let's do electric cars.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   Is there any electric cars?
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   They're doing this in conjunction with Acclomer.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400]   What is the process?
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.400]   Is all the buses?
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.400]   Oh, wait.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.400]   They're diesel buses.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   All right.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.400]   All right.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   All right.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.400]   And then as long as we're getting a smarter, smarter Google,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.400]   Google Search can now tell you if a store is crowded.
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.400]   What?
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.400]   How do they know that?
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.400]   Because of maps?
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.400]   Because they know where you are.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400]   And they can --
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.400]   Well, do they know where everybody else is too?
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   Yes, exactly.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.400]   I mean, it's basically something we've done with traffic, right?
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.400]   If you look at the traffic stuff, they tell you where people are
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.400]   in cars based on where their phones are.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.400]   So you can know that the best time to go would be like five o'clock
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.400]   or whatever.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400]   But full screw has done this for ages.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.400]   Oh, really?
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   I asked Dennis and Dennis and said, "Yeah, we've been doing this
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.400]   forever.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   If you look at the venues --
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400]   They know when it's busy.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.400]   But Foursquare only has Foursquare data."
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.400]   Yes, Foursquare only has more data.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:39.400]   But the -- yes, so Foursquare has Foursquare and Swarm data,
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.400]   which is fewer people than Google has.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.400]   But they do now have ambient data as well as checking data.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.400]   Business hours and popular hours have been on the Foursquare web
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.400]   and mobile venue pages forever, according to Dennis Crowley.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.400]   And if you actually sign up, if you claim your venue on Foursquare,
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   part of what they give you is here's the traffic from people
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400]   and people.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.400]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.400]   Oh, I'd like that.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.400]   It's a very handy thing as a business owner.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.400]   You can see where they -- when people are coming and what people
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.400]   are saying about you as well and so on.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.400]   Well, people are saying what you can see directly.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.400]   But the traffic stuff is interesting.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:19.400]   Okay, Google's gotten more powerful than you can now use
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   "Okay, Google to send messages via WhatsApp, WeChat, NextPlus,
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   Telegram and Viber."
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.400]   How do you do that, Jason?
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.400]   You say, "Okay, Google send a message via Viber?"
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:35.400]   Yeah, send a WhatsApp message to blank answer message here.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   Nice.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400]   Okay.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   That presumably means -- is that unilateral on Google's part
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.400]   or does WhatsApp have to cooperate?
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.400]   Yeah, the developers have to -- have to cooperate by building
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400]   in the appropriate code.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.400]   Every Android app should allow.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.400]   Is there an intent to that?
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.400]   It's just a send message intent.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.400]   It's an intent, yeah.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.400]   Yeah, it must be an intent.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   Yeah, I mean, Google's been doing this over the last couple of
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.400]   months kind of opening up the voice actions a little bit here
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.400]   and there to different apps.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.400]   So 70 apps now.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.400]   It's going to be coming through.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:13.400]   Breaking news, zip car, Spotify, TuneIn, YouTube, all recipes,
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.400]   RunKeeper job, and these will all show up in Google now as well.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.400]   So that's nice.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.400]   Love that.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.400]   App integration makes it even more useful.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.400]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.400]   Come back with more.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   Jeff Jarvis, Kevin Marks, Leo LePort.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.400]   We're talking the Google running a little late today.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   So we'll get through these next --
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.400]   It's Tuppies' fault.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.400]   I installed Windows 10 and I could not end Windows weekly
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   until I completed it, which when it was like a long show.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.400]   You know, I was trying to fix my microphone problem on the machine.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   I decided to rebuild it.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   Took about 38 seconds.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.400]   Stop it.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:52.400]   Shut up.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.400]   You got Google Chromebook there.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.400]   That is one nice thing about Chromebook.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   Although, you know, Apple still doesn't do this.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.400]   Apparently they're going to, but right now Windows, when you log
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   into your Windows account and you kind of are have to if you're
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.400]   going to use Windows, it knows all your stuff.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.400]   I got my desktop wallpaper.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400]   I got Facebook Connect.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.400]   All the things that were connected.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.400]   Just stayed connected, which is kind of nice.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:18.400]   I might be using more Windows 10.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.400]   I have to say, I'm impressed.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.400]   Apple does that too, but you've got to tell it where it's getting
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.400]   it from, right?
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.400]   You can go through your account.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   You can go through your account.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   Add accounts.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   Add accounts.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.400]   It counts.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   It counts.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.400]   It really does it.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   It's so easy on a Chromebook.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   But the Chromebook stores nothing anyway, so it's just --
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   But also, Android, when I got Rosie the Nexus 7, when I booted up,
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.400]   it says logged in as her.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   It said, do you want to get everything off your phone?
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.400]   So it was able to get all the stuff off of Samsung phone and
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.400]   install the apps from that and get most of it there without having
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.400]   to do much fiddling with it afterwards, which is how I found
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.400]   that three of the apps didn't work.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.400]   Yeah, no, I like that.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   That's one thing I do, and I'm sure Jason, you do every few
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.400]   weeks is set up a new phone.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.400]   And it's really nice.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.400]   It's become easier and easier and easier.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   It has become easier.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.400]   It has become easier and easier.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   I sometimes do it just for fun.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400]   You would.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   They're not going to watch Game of Thrones tonight.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   Let me wipe my phone and start over.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.400]   I just feel like sometimes it really -- sometimes, like the S6,
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.400]   I keep doing that to the Galaxy S6 because that thing has so many
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   problems, and I just keep wiping and starting over.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   And it's good for a while, and then it starts getting messy.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400]   Really?
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.400]   I think it's something to do.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   They're using this Exynos processor, but there's actually -- it's
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:43.400]   two processors, two dual-core processors, and they default to
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.400]   the slow one unless you need more power and then kick into the
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   fast one.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.400]   And I think the handoff isn't very good, and you can feel the
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.400]   phone get really hot and the battery, you can almost watch it
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.400]   go down as it switches to the fast processor.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.400]   But I think the back and forth handoff isn't done well.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]   That's my guess.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   I don't know.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.400]   Samsung is in deep doo-doo.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.400]   I feel like they're just -- I don't know who's going to take
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:16.400]   over, but you know, they just -- maybe Motorola.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400]   Motorola is doing the right thing.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   They're making it a pure phone.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.400]   Our show today brought to you, my friends, my pager duty.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.400]   Are you on pager duty?
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.400]   Nobody -- I think nobody carries a pager anymore, but all of
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   us have had the experience of being on call.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400]   Maybe not all of us.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   If you haven't, you are lucky.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   Being on call is tough.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.400]   Pager duty makes it better.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   Don't hate the pager.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.400]   Hate the game.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.400]   If you're on call, you will love pager duty.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   Get the boss to take a look at this.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   It decreases alerting noise for IT operations, for developers.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   Make sure that the right person is notified at the right time.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   It's nice because it integrates with everything you use.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   We use new relic and integrates with that.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   Nagios, keynote app dynamics.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   You even have -- there's over 100 ready to use integrations, but
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.400]   you even have the capability of rolling your own.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.400]   They've got very nice APIs with pager duty.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.400]   When an incident occurs, pager duty actually looks at the on
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.400]   call schedule.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   And then it looks at your personalized alerting preferences.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   So the right team member is notified in the right way.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.400]   And if that person doesn't respond, pager duty will automatically
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.400]   escalate issues to another team member until it is responded to.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   It's smart.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   You could dispatch alerts.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.400]   I guess you could probably still use a pager, but also automated
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.400]   phone calls, SMS, email, push notifications, which means you
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.400]   can be on call, but be there if you're needed.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.400]   Decrease the noise too, because incidents are automatically
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.400]   filtered and de-duped, so only actionable alerts are delivered.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   Great analytics tools means you can proactively make system
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.400]   improvements to prevent future issues.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.400]   That's nice too.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.400]   And boy, is it relentless when it comes to reliability.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   You can depend on pager duty, fully distributed across multiple
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.400]   data centers, multiple hosting providers, multiple contact
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   method providers per method.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:19.400]   Yeah, pager duty is robust, reliable, and very smart.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.400]   You can fully customize it to fit you and your team, regardless
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.400]   of size or location.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.400]   That's why Microsoft uses them.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   GitHub uses them.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   Boeing, Nike, Pinterest, Box.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.400]   You'll see the list at pagerduty.com/twit.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.400]   Sign up for a free two-week trial, or just sign up for as little as
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.400]   19 a month.

[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.400]   Hate the game.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.400]   Sign up at pagerduty.com for a new account and you'll get the
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.400]   t-shirt for free.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.400]   That's a great t-shirt.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   When you go to the pagerduty site to watch the videos, they have
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.400]   some very great, really, it's the kind of company you'd like.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   It's great.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:08.400]   pagerduty.com/twit.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.400]   Google Translate Now Translate's printed text in 27
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   languages.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400]   I had it all set up.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   I had the sign reader set up when I went to Germany and Austria
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.400]   and Hungary.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   I had the talk thing.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.400]   Have you ever used the talk thing?
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   Oh, yeah, I have.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.400]   So it's like you've got a simultaneous translator in your
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.400]   phone.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.400]   You speak and then it says it in German.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.400]   Of course, you didn't have to use it in German because everybody
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400]   in Germany speaks English.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.400]   Better English than I do.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   Y'all.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   Amazing.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.400]   You speak in Sweden.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.400]   I can do that.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.400]   I can do that.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.400]   You know what?
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   I can do that.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   What I realize now is everybody around the world has a better
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.400]   educational system than we do.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   We used to have the best, higher education is free in Germany.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.400]   Yes.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.400]   You know, if you want to get a higher education, you can.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.400]   It's free.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.400]   I just started.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:07.400]   And you see the results because that is a well-run country.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   Well, the language thing is fascinating as well because
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.400]   something we've been talking about with IndieWeb is how do I
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.400]   mark up my page when it's in different languages?
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.400]   Right.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.400]   And most of us are imperfectly multilingual.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.400]   We speak one language well and some other languages a bit.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.400]   And some people are very, very fluently master languages.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   But Google has baked into it this weird assumption that every web
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   page is in a single language.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400]   And if you actually go to their webmaster device, it says make
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.400]   different pages in different languages.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.400]   And then they don't respect the markup you put in the page to say
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.400]   what language it's in.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400]   They run it through their guess what language this is program.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   And then they will say this page is in Japanese.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.400]   Do you want to translate it?
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   Right.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400]   Which means if you've got a page that is generally in a mixture
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.400]   of languages, it will fail on you because it says it's based in
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.400]   Japanese.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.400]   It will translate the Japanese bits.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   But also it doesn't take into account the fact that most people
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   in the world do understand multiple languages to different
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   degrees.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   It has this sort of very monoculture monolingual approach that
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   is very American to some extent.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   I mean, English too.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   Making it one of the worst big English was part of the
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400]   British Empire.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.400]   Great.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400]   It made life very easy for me in school.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   If you go to the first link under my numbers, I'm not going to
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.400]   use any way to worry.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:30.400]   It's the new Google News Lab has a way to see what languages are
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   used for queries on search in what cities?
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   Oh, how interesting.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400]   What is going on?
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.400]   This is Shanghai.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   Number one search in Shanghai by a long shot is English.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.400]   Well, this is also what it is based on Google.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.400]   Oh, that's 2004.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.400]   Let's zip ahead.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   It got bigger for a little while in 2008, 2009.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   Now in 2015, actually, English is the only one because most
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   people in China aren't using Google.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   English, Japanese, German, French.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400]   There are people using Google in Shanghai will be tourists.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   Oh, OK.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.400]   So if you go up to the cities, let's use a different city.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   What would be good?
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.400]   Berlin, New York.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   Yeah, Berlin.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   Paris is going to be all French.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   Oh, look at that.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   A lot of German searches.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.400]   Wasn't that way in the early days of the web.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.400]   It was kind of.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   Oh, tell me what you should try.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   Geneva.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.400]   Ah, what language they speak in Geneva.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.400]   They have a few.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   Oh, they don't have Geneva.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400]   OK.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.400]   We'll try London.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   I'm just curious.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.400]   Paris has got to be like 100% French, right?
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   They don't even bother telling you.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400]   They can't.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.400]   It's like, I can't be both out.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   I'm busy.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400]   Where should I try?
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.400]   Deli?
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.400]   That'd be interesting.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.400]   I was trying to try London because London is a very polyglot city.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.400]   I think I broke it.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.400]   You broke it.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   Yeah, it's not rendering.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400]   You.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   The JavaScript graphs aren't loading.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   I broke.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.400]   You don't like JavaScript too much?
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400]   I can.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.400]   That's another round.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.400]   But I will stick my language around for now.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400]   I have London.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   The other thing that Google does.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.400]   Look at London English is like not even.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400]   There's no second best.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   Oh, be good.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.400]   Oh, there's something.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.400]   Well, it changes over time.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.400]   See, in the early days of the web, you didn't have much choice, right?
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400]   You had to use English.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   2011 English.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   It's a little bit more English.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.400]   Part of that is that they assume that everyone's browser is set to English by default, so they'll try and give you a more sensible level of default.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.400]   Oh, that's set.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.400]   They don't pay attention to the regionalization.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.400]   They do pay attention to the regionalization except when it's set to English.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.400]   If you set it to German, I think you'll get German in America, but it's setting it to English.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.400]   You're out of luck.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.400]   There is a lot of silliness around this.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.400]   There is the assumption, because they have, especially when you're logged in, they know who I am.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   They know what languages I search in.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.400]   I've got a preffle my phone, yet somehow they've decided that, oh no, we're giving it to you.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:35.400]   I'm not sure if this is still true, but it used to be true that if you go to Switzerland and go to Amazon, they give you German, even if you're in the French-speaking bit of Switzerland, or the Italians-speaking bit of Switzerland.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.400]   They decided that German was the language you have to speak if you're using Amazon in Switzerland.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   Well, that's a mistake, right?
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:46.400]   It's this sort of strange, it's this sort of nice simplifying assumption that you make if you're an engineer and you're not thinking very hard.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   How about chauvinism?
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:52.400]   Country equals language, which is not even true for America.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   There are something like, something where between 20% and 30% of Americans speak another language a lot of the time in the home, and many more than that actually are able to speak them.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:20.400]   So it is this sort of strange monoclot assumption, which is based on the fact that that's the people who are executives of their company.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:25.400]   And so that hasn't been challenged strongly, that's up to now.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:32.400]   There is still this assumption that you're speaking with a language, which is strange, because as the companies grow, this needs to change.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   But there's still this assumption that each web page is in a single language, and that's how things should be.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.400]   What is the social web acid test?
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400]   The social web acid test, I'm glad you asked.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.400]   What?
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:50.400]   Play in the video, the video is only like a minute and a half long, so play this, you need sound.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.400]   Look, this has got music.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   This is a demo.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.400]   Ben takes a photo of me.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.400]   Ben Ward Miller takes a photo of Aaron Pericki.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   And Robert comes in the photo.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   So this is the way he does tags.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   And what's supposed to happen is that I get a notification that I was tagged in the photo.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.400]   Even from a different website, not from Facebook, just from a website.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.400]   It is what happened on my phone.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.400]   Wow.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.400]   So it's like a notification.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:22.400]   And step three is somebody sees that photo in their reader.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   This is really one of their vote participants.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   And whoever sees that is going to post or apply in that reader.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   So I really want to push my luck here.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.400]   Does anybody confirm they're going to send a comment on IRG?
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   Look at all the comments.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   There we go.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.400]   And is that using any pub?
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.400]   I mean, sub pub, sub pub, sub pub, sub pub.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.400]   I'll explain that.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.400]   It's a bit sick.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.400]   So he's got notifications on his phone.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.400]   So now if I go back to the computer.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   Or you could just use Facebook.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.400]   There they are.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.400]   Hey.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.400]   Hey.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   Sweet.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.400]   So what reader would they use?
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.400]   They had sign-in to Woodwind.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.400]   This is what they saw on in their reader was this post.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.400]   And that is a fully functioning demo of Swan Zero across three different...
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.400]   The social web acid tests.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.400]   Three different locations.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.400]   So Kevin explained it all.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.400]   All locations.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.400]   Super SoulSight Street.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.400]   Victory for indie webcap.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:32.400]   So the music was actually composed by Aaron as well, which is kind of fun.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   It's called an Ordinary Day.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.400]   He composed it for a different film project, but then he decided it fit really well.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:44.400]   So the point of this is this is something that was defined in 2010.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:50.400]   Well, at the point where we're talking about federated social networks, which is back in the open social days,
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.400]   we're all trying to make these things work together.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.400]   Before Facebook was the hegemonitist now.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.400]   And the test is explained as that series of steps.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:04.400]   Ben takes a photograph.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.400]   He tags Aaron.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.400]   Aaron gets notified.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.400]   Other people see the thing in the stream, comment on it.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   And then both Ben and Aaron get notified that that has happened.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.400]   So it's this flow that happens very naturally on Facebook because it's a single system and does that.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.400]   And the challenge is how do you make this work across multiple different systems?
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:30.400]   And so that's what's going on there is there's a set of different protocols we're using in indie web to do that.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.400]   So there's micro-pub to post to the sites.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:41.400]   There's web mention, which is how I say I've done something to you on my site.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.400]   I've tagged you with that.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   So in the first case, Ben posts a photograph.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.400]   He tags it to say it's a photograph of Aaron.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.400]   So he puts a person tag on it that says AaronParecki.com.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.400]   And then he sends a web mention to Aaron's website.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:03.400]   And so then Aaron has a process running that detects he's had that web mention and sends a notification to his phone so he can go and look at it.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   The commenting bit, that's done with another site.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.400]   There's a indie web reader now.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.400]   There's a couple of them.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:19.400]   But the one that we used in that demo is Kyle's reader, which is reader.carwm.com.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:26.400]   And you log into that with your indie website and then you've subscribed to feeds and then it gives you a feed reading experience.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:36.400]   And it gives you a little comment, retweet, like box at the bottom, which uses micro-pub to post the comments and the retweets and the likes.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   And they will go back to the person who's post you've given them on, which was the third stage of that.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.400]   We wear Aaron Got the notification.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   Well, Aaron Got the notification.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.400]   Sorry, Ben got the notification because it was his post.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:25:01.400]   And then Aaron got a notification because Ben put that comment on his post saying that these people had commented and then resent the notification to Aaron that the posts had changed so he could detect that change and show it.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:08.400]   And it's like the pen and teller thing where they do the three balls trick and you go, that's clever.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   And then they show you how they did it and then you go, wow, that was really complicated.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.400]   It's a bit like that with this.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:22.400]   The point is that if you're doing it in a single system, this is just a bunch of database queries that happens within the system and you can build that thing and it's a known thing.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:30.400]   So if you're doing something like Twitter or Facebook in a single system, doing this stuff, it's well, I'm not saying it's not work and getting the user interface right is hard.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.400]   But it's something that's straightforward to build.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:39.400]   Doing in such a way that works between sites is a different kind of work because you've got to agree what the protocols are for all these different pieces.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   You've got to work out what different kinds of notifications there are and write things to handle that.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:53.400]   And so this has been a test that was set up as a thing to pass in the same way that acid test was set up for browsers to inter operate to pass five years ago.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:59.400]   And at India Webcamp, I think it was two weeks ago, the India Webcamp in Portland, we finally got all the pieces together.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   And I was just saying one place, but actually it was also distributed.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]   Ben was posting from New York.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.400]   Kyle who responded was in San Francisco and Aaron was in Portland.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:14.400]   And I think Amy responded as well when she was in the UK in Brighton.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.400]   So there was this whole like it was.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.400]   And it wasn't just a demonstration.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.400]   The point is that we've now got these protocols and we're using this stuff all the time.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:30.400]   So we've now got the building blocks that we can put together to build these kinds of systems across multiple different sites.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:39.400]   So I think that's, I'm excited by it because it's a demonstration, but it's also showing people that the kind of things they do every day in Facebook can be done elsewhere.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   So we just got to work on the 1.5 building users thing.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.400]   Cool.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.400]   For the reason I feel like we've all given up on the Federated Web, but.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.400]   Well, you're using it.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.400]   I love it.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.400]   But I just feel like most people are just going to say, well, why not just use Facebook?
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.400]   It's like it's sad to me.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:05.400]   And I think you're fighting the good fight, but sometimes I feel like maybe you're Don Quixote tilting in windmills.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.400]   Maybe it's.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:13.400]   I mean, the thing is that, you know, at the point when we, when they wrote this test, you'd have said, why don't just use my space.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.400]   In 2010, yeah.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   In 2010, so that the assumption that the silos are permanent is a mistake that the.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.400]   No, we shouldn't.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.400]   We shouldn't.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   I agree.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.400]   We should fight.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400]   So making sure that the biggest.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.400]   It's, I talk about like fragility debt.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:37.400]   So the, you got the idea of technical debt where you build something and you sweep the bugs out of the carpet until it blows up in your face.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:43.400]   The fragility debt is the same thing where you rely on a particular system for a long time and you actually move everything into that.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.400]   And so it's, it changes and the world has been pulled out from under you.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.400]   And that is a problem that we have.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   We've, you know, we've seen that in tech many times with whether it's a system version of policing and app, whether it's, you know, the one that hurt me was Apple discontinuing ideas can suddenly hold a bunch of data I had went away and my website went down and so on.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:12.400]   So it's, it is this thing where you can, you can rely on these, you, I'm not saying don't use Facebook.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   You know, India doesn't say that at all.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:30.400]   What it says is use your own site and share copies out to Facebook and make sure to Twitter and make sure that you can read stuff back so that if, if those systems delete your account or go down or get acquired and change their idea of what they're doing, you haven't lost everything.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:36.400]   So it's a, it's a, it's a defense in depth thing. It's, it's the sense of having, having only your own where person is important.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.400]   It's not important to everyone in the same way.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.400]   It's important to those of us who publish on the web all the time.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:53.400]   But having that option is good and being able to store your, store your things in a way that isn't completely reliant on one company continuing in the direction they're continuing is important.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:59.400]   Jeff Jarvis, you were at VidCon. I was, I was.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:04.400]   How was that? It was cool. I, I wish I'd gone before 23,000.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400]   This is your first time. 20.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.400]   Wow.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   Of course, 99.9% of the martinage girls, which is odd.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:25.400]   I have to say, and you know, I'm, I know I'm the old radio, old media guy who's mocking YouTube and the YouTube fan base and they don't, they don't ever fly.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:33.400]   And one piece of evidence that people like me use is all those teen girls in the front row.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:37.400]   But on the other hand, the Beatles team girls kind of like the Beatles.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400]   They seem to have legs.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   And it's so, so I, I, I, Howard Stern, as you may know, makes fun of podcasts and the internet and, and I were on Stern.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   So I called Stern.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.400]   I think it was on Monday.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.400]   Yeah. People were telling me.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400]   Hey, George, mention to you guys.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:56.400]   I plugged twig because I said, listen, these are, these are real businesses.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.400]   And what did he say to them? Oh, they're not a size. Well, he, because what he does.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.400]   I would know, but he's on satellite radio and I've never been able to listen.
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:09.400]   He says, oh, watch it, watch it. He does an old fart thing where he says, you know, podcasting his BS.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:14.400]   And if you really want to work in radio, you have to get a job in broadcast and you have to get an audience there.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.400]   You have to prove to yourself and learn your ropes like I did.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.400]   And I called it and I said, Howard, you're the one who killed radio broadcast.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   You killed it. You're the, you're the man who killed it.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:30.400]   And for you to expect people to do what you did after you've already killed it and pulled the ladder up behind you, that's, that's gone.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   And I said, plus this stuff is really big. And I said, I went to VidCon.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:36.400]   They all started laughing. You know, what cost of did you wear? I says, not Comic-Con.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   And I said, these things are based, you know, like who?
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:48.400]   So I mentioned PewDiePie at all week. He's been, he's constantly, he's been, he's been, he's been constantly, he's been pushing me on Twitter.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   He's been pushing PewDiePie. The joke was PewDiePie just bought Howard's turn.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.400]   But he's, you know, they don't make how much money do you buy?
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.400]   PewDiePie makes $7 million a year, $7.8, $5 million a year.
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:02.400]   And, oh, and how many followers does he have? 38 million people follow him.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:08.400]   And, you know, granted, I should point out that his peak in radio, Howard had about 20 million.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:13.400]   And, and Sirius is approaching 30 million total subscribers. Granted, those people pay every month.
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:23.400]   You know, not at all comparable. But pretty amazing. And I mentioned you. And I mentioned, you know, you know, Jake, Jake Eager, who I interviewed on stage about the young Turks.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:28.400]   And you both have fairly similar businesses in size and scale. And they're good businesses.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:36.400]   And, and there's a future here. And he, and so I also yell at Howard saying, why the heck do you want to be a wage slave?
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.400]   If he and I long before Jason Calicon has ever said this just recently.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:46.400]   I'm very nice by Jason, in which he said, how would you just do on demand on Spotify?
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:59.400]   Yeah, I've been arguing to the, for, you know, I think I reveal this, when his contract, last time was to be renewed, his people contacted me and I introduced his people to the top echelon at Google.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:08.400]   And nothing came of it. But, but imagine Stern on YouTube, imagine Stern. I said, well, why are you sharing? He said, I got a paycheck.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:14.400]   I said, yeah, but you're sharing the value and the revenue was serious. You should have your own empire. You should own your own thing.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:22.400]   People would pay for it. It's really true. If Howard did an app, I would think he'd make more money.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:31.400]   Because I would listen to Howard Stern, but I can't because I don't have serious. You would keep more money. Yeah, I pay, I pay 12 bucks a month or whatever it is now. It's probably 15 bucks a month for all I know.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:39.400]   On three autos, all kinds of things, plus for the online, serious for one reason. Howard Stern. Yeah, see, I'm not that devoted.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:49.400]   But if there were a Howard Stern app, I might listen. So, though, the thing is, so I imagine if Stern did leave his contract is about up, if he did leave, would I keep serious?
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:58.400]   A year or two years ago, I would have said, yeah, because I don't listen to broadcast. I said to him, by the way, and he said, well, broadcast is still big. I said, crap. And it's crap. He said, well, yeah, it is.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:04.400]   That's not that big. No. The thing is, a couple years ago, I would have been getting to book testing.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.400]   Say again? Well, yeah, but as a last ditch effort to save a dying business.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:16.400]   Well, the podcast, the podcasting podcasting. Hey, I'm a perfect example.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:24.400]   A public radio executive had listed to be on Stern. I love it when NPR people love Stern too. I read last love Stern.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   The executive from elsewhere in public radio and said that he gives millions of dollars a year in fees to podcasters. And now he's at the point of putting podcasters on the air just to make the air cool.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:46.400]   Interesting. And that's the flip that you want to see at VidCon. That's the flip. That's when these guys become bigger than broadcast. And I got to tell you, it's going to happen any minute now.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   Because just stuff about them touring. That was weird. But just look at what kids are. First of all, anybody under 18 is not watching TV at all.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:01.400]   One of my daughter took me through all the things she watches. There's maybe there was one with big red lips. And she interviewed Jerry Seinfeld, like him.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:08.400]   So there was a great moment when Katie Couric interviewed Zae Frank on stage.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:16.400]   And so Zae just looked at it at one point and said, what happened with the world? Cause Zae is there running a lot of time right now too.
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   Yeah, he's running motion pictures for BuzzFeed. And he's trying to like, like, buys he's trying to create shows on broadcast. And Katie is on the Internet. He said, what happened here? They crossed streams. So to speak.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:40.400]   And so VidCon also, but here's what got me Leo. My Piffany from VidCon was this. It wasn't my Piffany. It was from the stage. It was from the Green Brothers and others on stage.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:52.400]   And I think Zae Frank too. It's not as if, well, you share video of this sort of YouTube. You're not saying to somebody, this is very good content. You should watch this content because I recommend it.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:35:00.400]   What you're doing is social signaling to say, this says something about me and my relationship. And what I think of you, why I'm sending this to you.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   And the content is a social tool. And Jake Uger realizes that. You realize that broadcast will never realize that just as newspapers can't realize it.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:19.400]   And it makes you think differently about what video is and why it's there. It's a social token.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.400]   That sure ended the conversation.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:37.400]   No, but it is a, well, it's exactly. It's a thing that you use as a shared currency of experience. You say, I saw the thing that you see this thing, which is, you know, you used to be network television was the way you did that.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:45.400]   And now it's the Internet and its memes and it's things like that. But it's also all these other channels and things that we have no idea existed.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   The one that got me was the digital stuff. You know about that.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.400]   So digital is a good article, which I'm trying to find.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   That's a joke. You're talking about digital equipment corp. I remember that.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   No, no, no.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:10.400]   Digital tour. DIGI tour. Basically, this is a company that set up the idea of taking these video online video people around to do live shows, which they sell tickets to.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:19.400]   They also sell a Meet the Star experience for $200 or something, which is basically you line up and take a selfie with the star of this video show.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:32.400]   And they're calling it. And it's, it's, and, you know, they're not like, they're not sending out stadiums, but they're doing lots of tours around lots of towns and lots of parents are bringing their teenagers to the shows to see this.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.400]   And the show's not even making any sense. It's just the point is that you have.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:46.400]   You know what this reminds me a lot of in the early days of rock and roll entrepreneurs would put together these kinds of tours where each band would play three songs and it'd be screaming girls.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:58.400]   This was a very, this was the, in the early days of rock. This is what was going on. Exactly this. And it wasn't huge audiences, but it was the beginning of something.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:06.400]   You know, I don't know if I don't know if this is it, but I do feel like there's something happening.
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:15.400]   I watched, you know, one of the grandmothers of this world is I Justine. And, you know, 31 and a grandma.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:20.400]   I know she's been around. I just, I adore you. I'm just joking.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:28.400]   But it was wonderful. I just sat in one of her sessions from the entertainment weekly stage, by the way, at VidCon and just watched her interacting with her people.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:39.400]   And she is amazing. She's just so warm and so enthusiastic and the combination of the girls who adore her and the boys who have terrible crushes on her, obviously.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:46.400]   And she's been doing this for years and she turned into a book and she turns around and she's doing, you know, the thing that VidCon is that, you know, there's three layers of VidCon.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:52.400]   There's the community level, which is the fan, which is the 23,000 girls. There's the creator level. And then there's the industry level.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.400]   The industry level is old white men like me, all trying to divvy up the money if the two floors below.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:07.400]   And the news layer, I mean, the creator there was fascinating. It went to a news panel with people on there who, you know, it was one snippy journalist I saw.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:10.400]   I said, well, a journalist with a lowercase J.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:22.400]   These people were reinventing news. And then on the lowest level, you sign up in a lottery, as I understand it, and you give your top choices for the YouTube stars you want to see.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:28.400]   And then you get, you win and you get a wristband. And the wristband cannot be mangled in any way.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:35.400]   If you want to give it to a friend, if you want to trade with a friend, the friend has to be with you at the moment they're put on and once they're on, that's the star you're seeing and nobody else.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   And then they go and they line up. As Kevin just said, just to have the selfies.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:42.400]   Yeah, this is just all about teenage girls.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:55.400]   I just put the link in the chat. But this is, there's a great article on BuzzFeed by Ellen Cushing about this, which he went on the road with this digital thing around different places with this with this crowd.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:06.400]   And it is fascinating. It's fascinating. It reads me because it is this thing makes, so this, you know, they sold 120,000 tickets for this thing.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:15.400]   And it is a bunch of teenagers in a van going on stage and saying hi to people. They're not really, you know, there's no performance.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:20.400]   There's no performance really. There's a little bit of performance. But the performance is at a school talent show level.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:26.400]   But it's also like a key rock. It's like a radio van going around and you can watch the jocks.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   It's a showcase. It's not. Yeah. That's all it is.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:37.400]   But so it's a sign that something's happening. It's not the end of the line by any means.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:49.400]   I'm the wrong guy to ask because I, you know, and I think Howard, frankly, I know, with all, with all due respect, Jeff, I know you love Howard, but he's oh, it's, he's, he's, it's, it's like saying, hey, Ed Sullivan, I think there's something going on here.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:40:00.400]   But he's got his thing. And he's done. And he's made plenty of money. He doesn't need to do it. He's 61 years old. Yeah. Yeah. But as, you know, as am I. So it's not. We're the wrong ones to talk to.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:07.400]   But I'm saying to him, I'm saying that there's one more, there's one more big innovation left in him. There's one. Is there really?
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:17.400]   The reason I push him. Yeah. And the reason I push him is one big star like Howard. One big star like Howard could prove the business efficacy of the Internet.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:29.400]   Yeah. And as, as entertainment. And, and I think that, you know, the, the satellite was nowhere. He came, they had, you know, a couple hundred thousand subscribers. He came on there approaching 30 million. He built that.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:39.400]   It really was Howard who did that. And then the same thing can happen. I think if the, if it is as Howard, it's Oprah, it's, you know, name who it is.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:48.400]   A big name star who says screw it. I'm not going on the Internet. I'm going to own it all. I mean, the one person who's gone come the closest is Louis C K, I would say.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.400]   Yeah. I don't really even care. I think that's sort of irrelevant.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:41:01.400]   Because whether Howard Stern gets involved or not, it's going to happen. This, by the way, this stuff is all hormonal, this VidCon stuff. It's just hormones.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:17.400]   But so T and as is most teen culture. As was Beatles. And so was the Beatles. So, but I do think that you're really close to the transition right now. And I'm sure network television executives are well aware of this.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   Where people just aren't going to watch TV. They're going to watch YouTube. They're going to watch, you know, six second Vine videos. They're going to.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:36.400]   And what's interesting to me mostly about these guys is they're learning how to create for a new medium. No one ever told me that you someday six second videos would be the platform.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.400]   If had they, I would have said, well, good luck with that.
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:47.400]   Yet it divine stars as we've talked about before, our genuine stars. There's no question about it.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:58.400]   I would hate if you when you tell me, Oh, YouTube, you should build your business on YouTube. I would say to you. Yeah, until Google decides to cut ad revenues in half or whatever.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:11.400]   Well, right. But that's just the indie web argument again. It's like you want you want to take advantage of the platforms that exist and put your stuff on there. But use them as a stepping zone to build a broader band, you know, which I just seen is a great example of that.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:26.400]   You know, she she was bootstrapped herself on Justin TV. She was the justine of the place Justin, but has gradually moved herself across a bunch of different platforms because she is, you know, she is good at this. She's a consummate performer and a very nice person who does relate to people.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:33.400]   And that is part of it as well. It's all about, frankly, from her end in my end, and we just interviewed Justine on triangulation last week, if you want to.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:51.400]   I think I could take a little bit of credit for discovering Justine. She says and I agree. And it's true for us that what we do is a community building. It's not viral video. It's community building viral video has is something that a lot of people in a lot of these teens are good at viral video.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:43:01.400]   But, you know, if you look at her views, some of her things have 15 million. Some of them have one million of vast majority are in the tens and hundreds of thousands of views. That's not where the money is.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:16.400]   It's in a lot of other things. It's community building. Howard has a community will follow him anywhere, but he's already built that. That's done. He doesn't. But he's sharing it with Sirius. Yeah. Well, that's his decision. I think he made a little money on that deal.
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:26.400]   400 million, right? Well, no, I see. Here's the thing. A lot of that money was made in stock that they didn't give him. Well, how much did he make? 100 million? Yeah, probably. Okay.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:37.400]   So he's okay. He's not hurting. No, no. He's not going to be the guy who changes the thing. Things. And it's not going to be Seinfeld comedians. No, it's somebody who comes along.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:48.400]   No, that's true. It's going to be somebody you never heard of. And it might not even be these kids going around in these showcases at VidCon. But that's going to happen regardless. It will happen.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   Because how we consume content is changed dramatically. And back to, so I'm trying to buy a new car now, because my 10 year, 11 year old Toyota is near its death. No air conditioning in this weather. I'm about to do it. By the way, I'm thinking about getting an Audi.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:16.400]   Oh, you'll love it. But I talked about this when you were gone. The problem I have with Jason, the problem I have is the only car that now has Android Auto is the Hyundai Sonata.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.400]   Don't get that. And Android Auto is not such a... It's Gingerbread.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:39.400]   No, Android Auto, I thought was supposed to take it for your follow-up. So we talked about this last week with Kevin Tofel and Rana Madi. Rana wrote his review. You should read his R's Technica. Very nice review of Android Auto. One of the things he discovers is that the operating system then running in the car is Android Gingerbread.
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:49.400]   Wow. And this is to me more telling, because everybody has to work with the Highway Transportation Safety Board, it's very limited what it can do.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.400]   Yeah, that's the problem. Better to put your phone up and just put it in the air vent.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:45:01.400]   Yeah, the phone will do anything you want. Don't worry about getting it to come show up in the screen in your car. That's, I think, a mistake.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:11.400]   Well, the thing, that will come, but you want as a Chromecast-like thing, which to be fair, it is close to being. The Android Auto is that. But you want this thing that is showing from your...
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:18.400]   But you'll never see, for instance, you'll never see a lot of apps on that screen because they won't let that happen.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:24.400]   Right, I agree with that. But all I'm saying is this. So the car I have now does not even have an aux plug.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:30.400]   Well, yes, you can get that. Just Bluetooth is all you really need. If you get the audio, you're good.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:38.400]   So at that point, do I need Sirius when I have... No! Why do you think I don't pay for satellite radio? I have it in every car.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:46.400]   If I want music, I listen to Spotify. And by the way, T-Mobile gives you unlimited data. It doesn't charge you for data for 30...
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:53.400]   For most music, including Apple Music and Spotify. Or Google Music. Straight and free. Yes.
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:46:03.400]   Wow. Anybody who... Nobody... This is... Radio's Dead. Satellite radio's deader than Dead. The whole thing is completely changing because we consume media differently.
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:16.400]   Last night, I was watching a TV show on cable because I'm an old man. And Michael comes in who's 12. And we start watching YouTube videos on my big screen because I have an Android TV device, the Nvidia Shield.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:21.400]   And that's what we watch, is YouTube videos. That's what he wants to see.
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.400]   I don't think Michael has ever watched a TV show. Ever.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:30.400]   Not what he's doing with the kid. How about you, Chris? Do you ever watch TV? Chris is 17.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:38.400]   I do watch TV. I watch HBO. I watch... Oh, so he's watching some cable channels.
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:44.400]   But you're too old. You're 17 now. You're too old. Oh, you don't watch it on cable. You watch it on the internet.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:54.400]   You watch your Netflix. My sons got into... It's always sunny in Philadelphia. So he watched the whole thing on Netflix from beginning to end.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:02.400]   Chris, what do you watch on YouTube? You're not watching the VidCon stars. You're watching something else on YouTube. What do you watch on YouTube?
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:08.400]   I watch a lot of regular content. I watch that. He's too old. I watch that. Let's play stuff all the way.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.400]   Let's play. That's what he watches. Yeah. You're a gamer, but everybody, I think of your generations.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:18.400]   I watch some vlog stuff. I watch the SciShow channel. I watch a pretty huge variety.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:31.400]   I look at my son. He's a 21. He grew up watching a lot of YouTube video stars. What's the ones where they make disgusting meals? Epic mealtime.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:40.400]   Stuff like that, which I think is juvenile and stupid and not particularly well created or funny. But that's because I'm an old fart.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:47.400]   It's fascinating, isn't it? Hey, we got to take a break. There's so much more I wanted to talk about.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:51.400]   But we'll just have to come back and do this next week. Is that okay?
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:58.400]   Yeah. Okay. It's one of the reasons I really like having a weekly show. There is always something to talk about.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.400]   Please come back.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:05.400]   And you too, Kevin. I love having you on. We're going to get your picks and your numbers and all that stuff. But first award from LegalZoom.

[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.400]   Um, I've got a couple of indie web things.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:43.400]   The first one can be a little challenge for you. So, I assume we can get this working. Okay.
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:46.400]   Read it dot car. Wm dot com.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.400]   Say it again. Reader dot Carl.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.400]   Kyle, I'll type it in the chat.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:59.400]   You can go to my L E M dot com.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.400]   Kyle, W M. W M.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:05.400]   So, this is that news reader that you guys were talking about or whatever.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.400]   You saw in the video. Woodwind.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:11.400]   Woodwind, yes. So, go to that. You got to log in. So, log in with your own site.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:16.400]   I have my own site set up and I have all of the right links and the rails and everything done.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.400]   So, that should work for you. Okay.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.400]   You don't have to blur my phone number. Everybody knows it.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:26.400]   Okay. Because I can get a verification code. Let me do that by a phone.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.400]   And that's the fastest, easiest way to do this. I love that system, by the way.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:33.400]   Yeah. That is awesome.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:38.400]   Well, this, I'll tell you about it afterwards, but there's another, some twist is on that coming too.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.400]   But log in with that for now.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:42.400]   And the only easiest way to get this answer. Now, you've got a feed reader.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:47.400]   And you have to follow somebody. You have to put your own link to follow.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.400]   And it gives you feeds and it will follow H feeds from India where people.
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:54.400]   So, I should join.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.400]   You need to go back to where you were. Hang on. What did you?
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:00.400]   You successfully authenticated. Congratulations. What's next?
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:05.400]   Create a sign in form to use indyoth.com to sign people in. No.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.400]   Did I something wrong or wrong?
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:12.400]   I mean, we'll go back to, it should have really, actually back to read it up card over again.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.400]   So, sign into Woodwind.
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:18.400]   Okay. Keep just talk about it.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.400]   That would do it.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.400]   These things happen.
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:24.400]   So, but it's a RSS feeds that it reads.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:29.400]   It reads H feeds and it reads RSS and Adam feeds. Yeah.
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:34.400]   Okay. So, I've authenticated. Allow indyoth access.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:39.400]   Is there a button? I should just repeat one of those green ones.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.400]   Yeah. I've clicked a few of them now.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.400]   Oh, all right. Oh, God. No, you don't have to log into that one as well.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.400]   I have to log into this. That's okay. GitHub. Okay.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.400]   Indyoth sign.
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:55.400]   Okay. Anything else you'd like to talk about?
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:59.400]   Oh, dear. This isn't working well, is it?
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:03.400]   Well, it's early days. Yeah.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:05.400]   So, okay. So...
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:08.400]   Stop, stop showing my screen. Let him talk.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:12.400]   And I will pursue this a little farther.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.400]   Can I show you my screen? Can I do that?
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:17.400]   No, don't do that. You will regret it deeply.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.400]   Okay. All right. I'm going to use Twitter now to authenticate or Google Plus now.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:24.400]   Google Plus usually works fairly well.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:27.400]   Yeah. I keep getting back to this Indyoth. I think something's broken.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:31.400]   You know what? Here's the problem. Everybody watching the show is doing it.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:34.400]   And we probably just broke whatever back end.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.400]   I warned. I warned Carl that was about to happen.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:42.400]   No, you can warn people, but nobody really fully understands the power of Twitter.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   Yeah, it's not working.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:49.400]   Okay. Just describe it. I've attempted to authenticate on every platform. It doesn't work.
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:52.400]   So, basically, it's a feed reader.
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:53:02.400]   But once you authenticate with your site, it also gives you the reply-like retweet buttons on it.
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:06.400]   But those post to your own site so that it means that the replies go to your site
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.400]   and the web mission send them back.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:09.400]   I want that.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:14.400]   I want more and more ways to pipe things into Leoville.net.
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:17.400]   Right. So that's the advantage of that.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:23.400]   So if you look at my feed now, known.kivvarks.com,
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:28.400]   you will see that most of it is little responses I've written to other people's posts,
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.400]   because that's how I'm using it now.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:32.400]   Nice. I will start doing this.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.400]   So you can see the response to the post.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:42.400]   And if you click through to those posts, you will see that my comments have appeared to them and so on.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:45.400]   Okay. So sorry that was a bit of a dance quick.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:46.400]   I'll get to trial fair.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:51.400]   One of the things that we are working on with IndieWeb is improving that auth experience,
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.400]   making it simpler for people who've got something installed,
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:58.400]   because the initial version of it assumes you're hosting your own site
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:02.400]   so you want to piggyback on someone else's auth, like Google's or Twitter's or whatever.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.400]   If you're hosting with a site that actually has its own auth,
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.400]   we're going to have a shorter path for that.
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:10.400]   And Kyle who has been building that with silo.pub,
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.400]   so that if you log in with a WordPress site,
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.400]   it'll just use the WordPress auth for it,
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.400]   rather than reading it, use for a second auth as well.
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.400]   So there's bits of that coming.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:19.400]   We've got that working. I'll come back and show you that.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.400]   You know what? I know what's wrong.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.400]   And Ben told me this.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:27.400]   I have to use www.leoville.net.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.400]   Ah!
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.400]   That's my bad, my fault.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.400]   Oh, you've got that? Okay.
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.400]   We'll try to get with this.
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.400]   That's an issue with no.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.400]   Is it a serious issue with...
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.400]   No, no issue with...
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.400]   No, it's not me. I know it's... Well, it could be me.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:41.400]   I don't know.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.400]   Please enter a URL now. It really is confused.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.400]   I think we did break it, actually.
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.400]   Oh, good.
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.400]   So now it's working.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.400]   No, it's good.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.400]   Okay.
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.400]   So I could subscribe to my own feeds.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.400]   Well, you could do that. That's kind of redundant.
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.400]   You could subscribe to my feed.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.400]   You could subscribe.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:02.400]   No.
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.400]   But he likes listening to himself.
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.400]   It's all right.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:06.400]   At the moment, you still...
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:07.400]   So reply makes a...
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:08.400]   Oop.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:09.400]   Now, I'll subscribe to you.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.400]   What is the URL I should use?
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.400]   No, in.cavymarks.com is me.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:16.400]   So these have to be specially set up.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:19.400]   No, you put it for HTTP,
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.400]   Windows.js in front. Sorry, that's a...
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.400]   Really? Come on, Kevin.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:26.400]   Now, which feed of these...
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.400]   The top one, the H feed one.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:30.400]   H feed. Okay.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.400]   So now... Oh, look.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.400]   So there's my post.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:35.400]   So now go to that settings page,
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.400]   the link that you went to before.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.400]   The what?
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.400]   And the top, it says settings.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.400]   Top, top, right, settings.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:44.400]   Okay.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.400]   Okay.
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.400]   Check MicroPUB.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.400]   Yeah, I support that on my site.
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.400]   Yep.
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:49.400]   Okay.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.400]   Author.
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.400]   I don't have to go through Authorize.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.400]   You've already done it once, so it should be quick.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:55.400]   Yeah, we'll just do that right through IndieAuth.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:59.400]   Yeah, and again, we're going to...
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.400]   This flow is going to get a bit more streamlined.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:05.400]   You feel like we're reinventing the web as we go.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:06.400]   I'm doing...
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.400]   We're reinventing the web as we go.
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:08.400]   We're reinventing the web as we go.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.400]   What?
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.400]   Okay.
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:11.400]   We're going to work this video...
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.400]   Let's try it with two slashes on the colon.
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:17.400]   I feel like it's all tied together with baling wire and stringing.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.400]   It is a little.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:19.400]   Okay.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:23.400]   Okay.
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:25.400]   Why not just use if this then that?
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.400]   Somebody asked.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:27.400]   If this then that is...
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:31.400]   The point is we're putting a protocol that should work underneath all this.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   You can't.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:35.400]   Everybody is saying, "Oh, use Facebook."
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:37.400]   But you don't want to rely on any...
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:42.400]   You want to rely on an open standard that will work even if Facebook or if this then that or Twitter goes out of business.
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:43.400]   Exactly.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:52.400]   And part of the point is, at the moment it's running on your own site, we want to make sure that you can log into these with Facebook or Twitter or Wordpress or Tumblr or Twitter.
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.400]   Tumblr or whatever as well.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.400]   That stuff is in the works.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.400]   So if I now go to the Kyle said, I do see in my...
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:02.400]   I see woodwind and I see a feed and I should add more subscriptions to this.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.400]   And then I can interact with you.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.400]   Once you've got the micro pub thing working.
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.400]   I'll get the micro pub thing working.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:09.400]   Okay.
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.400]   And I'm sure Kyle will look at this and go, "Oh, I should improve that process."
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:19.400]   So the other thing I wanted to show you, which is related but kind of fun.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:24.400]   If you go to www.pestergram.com.
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.400]   Okay.
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.400]   Pest a gram.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:28.400]   Pestergram, I'll put that in the...
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:29.400]   Okay.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.400]   No, I got it as well.
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:40.400]   So this is a site I first hacked together three years ago, as kind of a joke, which turns Instagram into Pinterest.
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.400]   You showed this on the show way back then.
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:44.400]   I like this.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:52.400]   So one of the... and if you click on... so you put a tag in at the top, then it'll give you the stuff about that tag.
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.400]   So... yeah, if it comes, that'll be a good one.
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.400]   And then you can also click through to people and see their feeds or to places and see the place feeds.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.400]   Nice.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:12.400]   But the thing I changed this week was that I marked this up with H feed, which means you can now subscribe to feeds from Instagram per tag in the feed reader.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:16.400]   So if you put in... don't know.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.400]   Don't put into it because that's not going to be a good tag.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.400]   Put in the indie web.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.400]   That's a decent tag.
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:22.400]   Right, so...
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.400]   Should I put a hash in front of it or...?
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.400]   No, just put a... just do that and you can return.
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.400]   Okay.
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.400]   So there's the indie web post.
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:34.400]   If you copy the URL from that at the top, it's pestergram.com/tag/indo, wouldn't it?
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:41.400]   And then go back to... with known... we go back to the reader and subscribe to that.
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:43.400]   Then you will see if you get the feed from that.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:44.400]   Ah!
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:46.400]   So I go to Kyle M's again.
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:49.400]   reader.kylewm.com.
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:51.400]   Subscribe to.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.400]   We'll paste that in.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:56.400]   And of course...
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:58.400]   Press return.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.400]   Yeah, no.
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:00.400]   No.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:01.400]   He's not here.
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.400]   Press return.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.400]   There we go.
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.400]   Oh, I was just thinking.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:05.400]   Oh, neat.
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:10.400]   So now it's putting those in as well because there's a post from Tantec and... and so on and like that.
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.400]   And if you had the things set up, you'd be able to respond to those on your site.
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:17.400]   If I'm not sure that propagate... I didn't think that propagates back to Instagram yet,
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:20.400]   but it gives you a way of following these things and tracking around.
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:24.400]   That's part of the problem is that it's not in Twitter or Instagram or Facebook's interest
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:27.400]   to support any of this stuff because they want to silo everything.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.400]   Well, but they have APIs and bridges and things.
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:33.400]   So the... you know, this... the pestergram site I built by calling an Instagram's API is...
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:34.400]   Right.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:37.400]   And then just generate them in a web page that implements these protocols.
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:38.400]   Right.
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:41.400]   And similarly, Bridgey implements posting back to Twitter, which is...
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:43.400]   I like Bridgey, which is cool.
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.400]   Yep, with that.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:51.400]   And the silo.pub thing that Kyle built, lets you post to Tumblr and WordPress and Blogger.
[01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:56.400]   So we're sort of gradually building the glue to connect these back to the existing silos.
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:00.400]   But we're still using these relatively simple protocols underneath.
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:05.400]   And the challenge is always, how do we make these... how do we authenticate into more than one place?
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:08.400]   You know, if you've logged into Facebook, you've logged into Facebook once.
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:13.400]   Whereas with these, if you logged into this, you've got to log in to your own site and then log into Instagram, whatever.
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:19.400]   So there's always going to be a little bit more friction when you're bridging two things together than having one.
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.400]   But I still think it's a... give that another try.
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:24.400]   Why not?
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.400]   Maybe people have gone away.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.400]   It should work with India, right?
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.400]   That's India's...
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:30.400]   No, don't click India.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.400]   Go back.
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:32.400]   Don't click India.
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.400]   That's what you're doing wrong.
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:34.400]   Okay.
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.400]   Micropub, authorize micropub.
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.400]   And don't use Twitter or Google.
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:40.400]   I'll use Google.
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.400]   It's my Google+ page.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.400]   No, it's your love to do Google.
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:44.400]   That will work.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.400]   Yeah, I am.
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:48.400]   Maybe I'm just impatient.
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:51.400]   Maybe it's just a question of impatience waiting.
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:52.400]   Oh, it's waiting for India.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:53.400]   I keep sending.
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:55.400]   I couldn't... shouldn't hit it again and again.
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:56.400]   Poor India.
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:57.400]   Oh.
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:00.400]   While I'm doing this, Jeff, do you have a number?
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:06.000]   Yeah, well, I could go on a rant about how a study has found that the Spanish linked
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.400]   tax actually hurt media and even killed sites in Spain.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:10.400]   Of course it did.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.400]   But that's boring.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:14.400]   So instead, what I'm going to do is a thing that's guaranteed to bring phone calls in on
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.400]   any talk show anywhere in America.
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:19.400]   And that's a discussion of pizza.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:20.400]   Yeah.
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:25.400]   Ten best pizza places in the US according to comments on TripAdvisor.
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.400]   Oh, that's such BS.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.400]   Of course it is.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   I already know it's wrong.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:29.400]   It's wrong.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:35.400]   Because everybody knows the best pizza place in America is Pepe's pizza in New Haven.
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.400]   No, it's Gino's East in Chicago.
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:39.400]   Okay, I'll give you Gino's East.
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.400]   Well, I have a little bit of a tourist.
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:42.400]   I've actually did a story.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:45.400]   I went around the country for People Magazine back in the day.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.400]   You must have gone to Pepe's.
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:49.400]   I did, but I still give it to...
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:50.400]   Do you like a deep dish though?
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:51.400]   That's different.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:52.400]   Well, that was pretty amazing.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.400]   Yeah, but it's a different thing.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:54.400]   It's not even pizza.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:55.400]   That's a deep dish.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:58.400]   Julianna is in Brooklyn.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:59.400]   I'll have to go there.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:01.400]   Pizza time in St. Augustine, Florida.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.400]   I can almost guarantee is not.
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:07.400]   Moose's tooth pub in Pizzeria in Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:08.400]   Number three.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.400]   Because that's illegal as pizza.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.400]   That's not even pizza.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:13.400]   That's a BLT.
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:15.400]   Bacon.
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:16.400]   Moose's tooth shrub in Pizzeria.
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:18.400]   I think we remain slantro...
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.400]   Slantro-Halloween Mayo.
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:20.400]   That should be illegal.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.400]   This is what's wrong, by the way, with Yelp.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:25.400]   Even Zagat.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:29.400]   The reviews are from people who live around there.
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:33.400]   And I bet you, it is the best pizza in Anchorage.
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:34.400]   Which says nothing.
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:36.400]   It says nothing.
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:39.400]   Have you ever been to Kesti, New York, New York?
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:40.400]   No, it looks good.
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.400]   That's like nice looking calzone.
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:46.400]   Donnie's pizza in Napolitana in San Francisco.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:47.400]   That's the one I just basically did.
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:48.400]   That's a good one.
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:49.400]   I recommend that one.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:50.400]   Never even heard of it.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:53.400]   No, if you want Italian pizza, it's really good.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.400]   It makes it so fresh, it makes Italian pizzas.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.400]   It looks good.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.400]   It stops when he's sold.
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:58.400]   The dough he's made for the day.
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:01.400]   I always go to Tomasos, so I'll have to trade Tony's.
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:04.400]   It's more central than...
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:06.400]   What do you call it?
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:09.400]   It's not in the Italian neighborhood, whatever that's called.
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.400]   It's in the heart of San Francisco's Little Italy,
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:12.400]   according to this.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:13.400]   Oh.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.400]   I didn't even know San Francisco...
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:15.400]   Oh, you mean North Beach?
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:16.400]   Is that what you're talking about?
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.400]   What's the name of the North Beach?
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:18.400]   It's not in North Beach.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:19.400]   Is that the one I'm thinking of?
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.400]   Oh, yeah, it is in North Beach.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:22.400]   You know what?
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.400]   It's where North Beach Pizza used to be.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:24.400]   Oh, no.
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.400]   I'm thinking of Una Pizza in the Polytonia.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:28.400]   Yeah.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.400]   This used to be North Beach Pizza.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.400]   All right.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.400]   Now we're really losing the audience.
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.400]   So this one's at 11th Street,
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.400]   11th and Howard.
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:38.400]   This one is really good.
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:39.400]   Oh, 11th and Howard.
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:40.400]   Yeah, it's got to be good.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:41.400]   It's under a freeway.
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:44.400]   What I used to appear on Ron Owens Show on KGO,
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.400]   back in the day, many years ago.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:47.400]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:48.400]   Ron's an old friend.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:49.400]   Oh, yeah, Ron's great.
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:51.400]   And whenever the phone lines look dead,
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.400]   my pizza, I would always not always say, you know,
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.400]   this town doesn't have any decent pizza.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.400]   Boom.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.400]   Boom.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:03:59.400]   There we go.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:00.400]   Yeah.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.400]   There are certain tricks that every talk show host knows.
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:04.400]   Yeah.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.400]   All right.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:07.400]   I think we're just really way out of time.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:08.400]   I apologize.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:09.400]   We had an hour late start.
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:11.400]   I apologize to everybody involved.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.400]   I will get MicroPub working and I will start playing with this
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:16.400]   because I think it's very intriguing.
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:18.400]   I think we want to know more about IndieWeb.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.400]   What's the best way to find out, Kevin?
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:22.400]   Come to home to a website club, as I said,
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:25.400]   or indiewebcamp.com.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:27.400]   Indiewebcamp.com.
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:28.400]   Yes.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.400]   And then get a known site up and running, either
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.400]   self-hosted or at withknown.com.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:35.400]   The easiest way to get started is to go to withknown.com
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:36.400]   and get your own site there.
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:37.400]   Yep.
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:38.400]   I agree.
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.400]   I'm going to give you one more number of web pages.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:40.400]   Yes.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.400]   And off the week here.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:44.400]   So first round capital is 10 years old and they did a survey
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.400]   of their companies and they found, I'll just give you this one
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:48.400]   finding.
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:51.400]   It's at 10years.firstround.com that companies with a female
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:55.400]   founder performed 63% better than their investments with all
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.400]   male founding teams.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.400]   No kidding.
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.400]   Ah.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:04:59.400]   There you go.
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.400]   No kidding.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:05.400]   Meanwhile, the chair is now debating the merits of pizza.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.400]   Pizza.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:07.400]   Yeah, myself.
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:08.400]   It's a slightly different piece.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.400]   Does Lisa count as a female founder?
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.400]   I think she does.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:13.400]   So there you go.
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:14.400]   There you go.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:17.400]   Hey, thank you very much Kevin Marks for joining us as always.

[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:31.400]   Woodwind.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:32.400]   Woodwind.
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:33.400]   It was a woodwind.
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:34.400]   A-weeda.
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.400]   Woodwind.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:40.400]   We want to thank Mr. Jeff Jarvis for spending his evening with us.
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:41.400]   Good to be back.
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:42.400]   Boston.
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:43.400]   Good to be back with you.
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:44.400]   I missed you.
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.400]   I'm really glad to see you.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:47.400]   Thank you for holding down the fort when I was gone.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.400]   Always a pleasure.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:50.400]   Always a pleasure.
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:52.400]   Jason Howell is our producer and technical director.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:53.400]   Thank you.
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.400]   Jason, job well done.
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:55.400]   Hey, Jason.
[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:56.400]   Thank you, sir.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.400]   Best way to learn about Android.
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:58.400]   All about Android every Tuesday night.
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:05:59.400]   I like to think so.
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:00.400]   I think so.
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:02.400]   Excellent show last night.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:03.400]   Thanks.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:06.400]   And we do this show every Wednesday, supposed to be 1 p.m.
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:07.400]   Pacific.
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:10.400]   I think it's really more like 1.30 and sometimes even later.
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:17.400]   It would be 4 p.m. Eastern time 2000 UTC live.twit.tv or get it after the fact on the man audio
[02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:20.400]   and video is always available after the show.
