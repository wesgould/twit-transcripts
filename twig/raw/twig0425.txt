[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.000]   I've ever seen any company announce.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.760]   And if you add the stuff from Nest last week, it's a Google Palooza.

[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover...
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.600]   Ah, gosh, it's so hard to say. Just really anything we feel like it. Mostly having to do with the internet and computers and technology.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   Jeff Jarvis is here. He's the professor of journalism. Wow, he's almost blue now from...
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   Trying to do...
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   I'm trying to do...
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600]   This is working better for a while.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   That doesn't matter. I don't care. It's fine.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.200]   Jeff is for some reason always confused cameras.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   I think he's like a vampire. He doesn't really exist.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   I am. I am. I also can't...
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   Those things that require you to turn on. I can't do it.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   I can't do it.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   Professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   He is our esteemed colleague and expert in many things.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   Author of what we're actually doing.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   I'm actually dead.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   He died in 1987 at right after his appearance on that show.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Was that show moonlighting?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   No, he's always welcome to have him.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   I'm thrilled to be back from France to say hello to Jeff and to also the wonderful Stacey
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   Higginbotham of IOT Stacey on IOT.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   That's her newsletter and of her IOT podcast.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   Hello Stacey.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   Hello.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Stacey.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   This was a really big day. We had a massive, very important announcement.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   A huge announcement from Sonos.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Oh, boy, you're going to start with that.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   Actually, it's interesting.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   A huge people.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   Because Sonos had to really think about this because both Apple and, it turns out, Google
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   are coming straight at them along with Amazon.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Sonos has promised for a year that they would put Alexa into a speaker.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   They did. They finally did.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   It's the Echo powered Sonos 1, which has a lot of interesting features.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   It knows where it is.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   It's a smart speaker.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   They announced, which I'm very relieved to hear, that every Sonos speaker will now be
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Amazon enabled because if you can connect a dot to the speaker, you'll be able to do things
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   like play Yani in the bedroom and things like that.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   They announced this a year ago, but they finally delivered.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   We're happy, right Stacey?
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   I'm super happy.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   And you forgot a huge deal.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.000]   The biggest deal is the new Sonos 1 that will come out later this year is going to have
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.200]   both Amazon Echo and Google Assistant on it.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   They really highlighted the Echo.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   Oh, so it's going to have an Assistant 2.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   Yes, so there's a couple of things.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   One, the first thing that we care about is if you have an existing Sonos, you will get
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   an update.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   I know where is my update?
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   And then two, you'll get Apple AirPlay 2, Apple 2, AirPlay, Apple 2, whatever the order
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   of operations there is.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   That'll come in 2018.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   And then the next big thing is they launched a speaker for $199 that's going to give you
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   a Google and Madam A.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   Sorry, I just set off people's Google.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   I like it so that I can connect my dot.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   I have a few dots lying around as you know.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   I can connect my dot to any of my Sonos is in my house.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   I have even more Sonos is and that will echo and enable all my Sonos is.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   Next year it'll add Google Assistant.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   To do that, I presume I'll have to add one of these Google devices to it.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   No, you'll have to add a new Sonos.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   That's what they're saying.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   You'll have to get the new Sonos 1.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   Your old stuff supports Madam A and Apple AirPlay 2.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   That's why I was confused.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   Your new one will get those two.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   All right, that's good news.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   Sonos 1 comes out October 24.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   It's only $200.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   It's kind of like the Play 1 speaker.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   It's the simplest of their speakers.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   And really, clearly, its main purpose is to integrate into a larger Sonos system.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   So that is very good news.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   And they were smart to announce it early this morning because then at 9am Pacific, Google
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   just dumped a ton of new products on the world.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   And wow, I said at the time as we were covering the event, Florence, I and I were here in
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   studio covering the event at the San Francisco Jazz Center, this is the largest product announcement
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   I've seen from any company ever, certainly from Google.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 new products.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   And arguably, the new phone was not even the biggest of these products.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   But let's start.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   Let's do it in, we'll walk through these in order.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   They started with the Google Home and the new Google Home Mini, which looks curiously like a donut.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   Especially.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   But it weighs less than a chipmunk.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Sorry.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   How do you know that it weighs less than a chipmunk?
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   That was the ad they did.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   Really?
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   It's smaller than a donut, where it's about the size of the donut and it weighs less than
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   a chipmunk.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   Especially the coral one.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:01.440]   At some point, guaranteed somebody's going to pick up the coral one and say, "Mmm, donut."
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.200]   But this is kind of like Amazon's dot, except that Google's decided to put an actual speaker
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   in it.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.080]   So the dot has a tinny little speaker, but this is the Amazon product, but this will have
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.680]   supposedly a better speaker.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   We don't know.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   We'll know.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.440]   The blues and the dot versus the regular home.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.920]   Well, it really comes.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.160]   Oh, with this instead of the bigger one.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.880]   We missed this, the whatever, the mini.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.520]   The mini versus the home.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.200]   I don't think anything except the size of the speaker.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   Speaker in the home.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.520]   Regular home is pretty good.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.720]   I can't imagine in something the size of a donut and the weight of a hamster that it
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.600]   will sound as good as the larger home, but...
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.160]   Squirrel, no chipmunk.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   Chipmunk.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   Not hamster.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.480]   There's a big difference.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.000]   This will connect via Bluetooth, they said, to other speakers though.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.640]   So you could have it power a bigger stereo or a bigger Bluetooth speaker if you wanted
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   more.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.840]   And I know, Stacey, this was of interest to you.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.040]   It will work not only with the newly elaborated Nest line, Nest Aladdin.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.000]   That's a whole bunch of products last week, but will also work with WeMo with Samsung's
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.760]   smart things with Hue, TP Link's home.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.840]   You liked that new TP Link home, I think, didn't you?
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.920]   I have the cool, what are those called, outlets that are rectangular?
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   I like those.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   They'll work with August door locks.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   It'll...
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   That's my thing.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.560]   You like the Augusts.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:34.360]   So you will be able to say, hey, G lady, ask August if my door is locked.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.120]   I don't know if you'll be able to unlock the door.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   That'd be kind of cool.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.360]   You'd say, hey, let somebody in.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.160]   Apple or Apple, August lets you do it on Amazon Echo if you enter a passcode.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.360]   That's smart because otherwise a burglar might shout through the window.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   I can see.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   Let's see.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   Siri, unlock.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.920]   Oh wait, Siri, talk to me.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.800]   Siri, unlock back door.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.560]   That's usually what I get with Siri.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.360]   Here's what I found on the web for unlock back door.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   I hate her.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.840]   The Nest thermostats will work, but I presume it will.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.160]   Nest now has a lot of security stuff in Nest.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   They just announced...
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.920]   Last week they announced their security stuff.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.360]   They also put Google Assistant on their indoor fancy cam.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.160]   They call it the Nest Aware Cam or Nest IQ.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.160]   I have one over my shoulder here because Lisa wouldn't let it be inside.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   Lisa's a smart lady.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.320]   She's in no cameras inside, which is ironic because last week Amazon announced it along
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.560]   the alarm clock from my bedside table that unaccountably has a camera in it.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.440]   Yeah, that thing is weird.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.680]   I put it on my desk.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   I ordered it.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.280]   I have a show on my desk from Google.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.440]   I mean Amazon.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.440]   That's in my kitchen.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   That little...
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   What do they call it?
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.440]   The dot spot.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   Spot.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   Spot really begs to be put on your bedside table, doesn't it?
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.200]   I think that's what they wanted us to do, but who's going to stick a camera on their
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   bedside table?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.040]   It seems dangerous.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.440]   I mean, it's weird to me that I have a speaker or a microphone, sorry, a microphone on our
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   bedside table.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.560]   I have a dot on my bedside table because it's hooked up to speakers and it's really nice
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.560]   to ask for music.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   I love that.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.240]   I think that's a great use.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.960]   So that's the new Google Home Mini.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.680]   It's kind of the best looking to the bunch, I think.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.320]   I think it's very attractive.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.400]   Again, even Google recognizes it looks a lot like a donut.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.280]   Do you order the colors or all those colors?
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.840]   There's great chalk.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.360]   Do you imagine this segment for you?
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.040]   And coral.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.120]   You can also...
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   There are new bases.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.040]   You see, here's a nice copper base for the Google Home.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.040]   Yeah, so they have a whole bunch of new bases for the Google Home.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.760]   Google, well done Google, by the way.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.960]   They were able to get this up and running on their store right away.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   Many of these things can be...
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   Yeah, I ordered a bunch of stuff with them.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   The old days where we kept on hitting.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.480]   Again and again and again and then we were out.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.360]   One of the things that really became clear to me during this event is that we are now
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.160]   all three of the big players are doing ecosystem plays.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.680]   Amazon, Apple and Google.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.040]   Yeah, really good point.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.880]   B&R ecosystem and everything will work well but no promises otherwise.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.280]   Ochles seems to be pretty open in terms of the home automation stuff but even then it'll
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.960]   probably all work better with Nest, right?
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.640]   It doesn't have to.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:43.200]   So it's unclear if Google Home and all will have, will have Weave which is the device
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.920]   communications and discovery protocol that Google and Nest are both now doing.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   So if they have that then things should work better.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.280]   But I don't know if they're going to have that yet.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   Or I don't know how well that's going to work.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   Guys, guys.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   Uh oh.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.800]   This is very important.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   What's that?
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.200]   Google is doing pop up stores with donuts.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   I love donuts.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.520]   Who is making these donuts?
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.960]   That's actually I have a very specific donut.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.320]   Like are you a fooded donut person?
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.840]   No, because I cannot eat a five pound pastry.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.160]   But I'm willing to try.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.720]   Google's New York City pop up shop is now open at 96 Spring Street.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:37.240]   Austin's is going to be the 21st of October on rainy run down there right now, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   Oh, sorry.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.720]   Do the show from here.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   Can get to Soho.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.480]   How long it take you to get down there?
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.680]   Up two and a half hours.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.680]   This is the verge.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.600]   I'm looking to see the donuts.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.560]   The made my Google pop up shop Monday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.160]   They're doing not only Manhattan, but also Brooklyn.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.320]   Oh, it's a very large place.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.160]   Seems ever as go October 4th.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   Are they really crispy cream donuts?
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   Crispy cream donuts.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.560]   How damn I'm going.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.720]   You had me at Krispy Kreme.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.040]   Is that your brand?
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.120]   That is one of my brands.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.120]   Yes.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.640]   That's what I'm looking for a sugary light fluffy donut that I can eat half a dozen of.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:26.400]   She pleases my brand for like terrible, terrible, Austin and voodoo donuts.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.480]   It's different every city.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   Food.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.000]   Oh, hang it.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.680]   I love October 21st and 22nd.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.960]   It's just going Johnny's donuts.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   This is all.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   This is all.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   This is all.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.960]   I haven't done it in years.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   Those things.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.200]   They should have done howdy donuts for Austin.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.840]   All that diety you've been doing, Leo.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   It'll just go away.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.920]   Yeah, we're going to be going on.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.240]   They call them sinkers for a reason.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.480]   I got the schedule on the rundown.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   Nice.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.040]   Thanks, Jeff.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   I presume that you can go in there and this is actually a good idea.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.720]   You could try this stuff because there are lots of questions.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.720]   For instance, Karsten Bondi, our producer, is wondering if those new Google headphones
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.000]   will do the translation thing, which is the coolest thing.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.840]   We'll talk about that in a minute, with the old Pixel or if you'll have to have a new
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.800]   Pixel for all the benefits of the Google earbuds.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.640]   That's a lot of processing power.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.640]   Oh, sorry.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.720]   I don't want to get ahead of ourselves.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.680]   Here, by the way, are the bases I mentioned.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.640]   If you have a Google Home as we all do, you can get coral.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.280]   What should they cost for those?
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.880]   Around 20 bucks and black.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:37.000]   They just pop it in there and it will compliment your home decor if you happen to be coral,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   brown, or black.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.880]   Yeah, I think they think people are more attached to these things than they are.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.680]   Google really was big on fabric.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.920]   In fact, they even brought out their industrial designer to go on and on about the fabric.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.000]   Like how many?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.360]   Yeah, I hate the fabric.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   I really do.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   I do not like it.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.120]   I do not like it Sam I am.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.160]   It gets gritty when I eat him.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.040]   No, I just don't like the look.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.200]   I want that copper base, but I don't really want to spend more money on a device that
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.800]   I'm like, eh.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.280]   Eh, eh, eh.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.200]   I think this is Google saying, look, this isn't Skynet.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.000]   This isn't a scary robot.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.080]   This is a friendly little donut sized, durable weight, fabric cupboard covered listening
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.440]   device in your house.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.840]   So why would you ever be afraid of that?
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.480]   Come on.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.880]   It is unassuming.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   Unassuming.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.200]   Perfect word.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.960]   That's the semiotics I was looking for.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.080]   Well, he's in the fence.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   Did you see?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   He is.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   My goodness.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   I should have taken.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.080]   I don't know.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080]   I don't know.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   I use that one correctly.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.160]   Well, never mind that.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.800]   So moving right along after they announced that they talked about this.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:08.200]   This is the Google home max premium audio to its assistant speaker also fabric covered.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.640]   It's hard to tell from this image how big it is.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.360]   It's not as big, not as monolithic as it looks.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.600]   It's actually, I had to look really hard.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.720]   It has four speakers, two tweeters.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.160]   They call them subwoofers mid-range, really.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.360]   And I have to look hard.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.480]   That isn't that big.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   It's a little...
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   What does...
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   It's a size of a loaf of bread.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.600]   I would say it's a size of a loaf of bread.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   $3.99.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   That's expensive.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.760]   This isn't sanity.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.160]   But you know what it is?
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   Okay.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.200]   The coolest thing that it does is Google calls it neural beamforming, which is a fancy way
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.520]   of saying, "Hey, it knows where it is in the room and it adapts its sound."
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   Smart sound.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.720]   Smart sound.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:56.360]   What struck me about this announcement was, "What the heck has Sony and JBL and all these
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:03.320]   other companies been doing for the last decade as machine learning has become much more accessible
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   to people?"
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.400]   Even Sonos came this close to losing everything.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.640]   Without their announcement to this morning, even they would be out.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.280]   And they're much more intelligent, much more than a connected than JBL or anybody else.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.560]   They did their tuning.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.600]   So remember probably two or three years ago, it's got a nice thing.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.280]   Odyssey or the other stereo tuning systems where you put out a microphone and it does
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.440]   all these sounds and then it tunes it up.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.080]   The Apple HomePod and this new Google Max do it without doing it.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.480]   I think they're not out to the end of the year.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.720]   I don't know what the HomePod does.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.200]   Yeah, we don't know it until the end of the year.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.800]   But my sense is they just automatically kind of listen and sense it.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.360]   The oldest thing is big.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:55.440]   It is 13.2 inches by 7.4 inches by 6.0 inches, 11.7 pounds.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.960]   It's heavy, which it should be.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.120]   It's bigger or usually heavy.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.640]   Heavy because of transformers, the big magnets in this bigger.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.960]   It's a loaf of bread.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.040]   Maybe a little bit bigger, but it's roughly a loaf of bread.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.760]   When you say big in speakers, that's a big in this kind of stuff.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.000]   That's what we call a small bookshelf speaker.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.640]   How big is a Sonos?
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   This is rough.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.720]   It's bigger than that.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.000]   The Play Five is a little taller.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.080]   The Play Five is actually wider too.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   And wider.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.080]   The Play Five is I think like 16 maybe.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.880]   I'm just looking at a Play Five right now and I'm like, it's wider.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.760]   It's wider than 13 inches.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.480]   Really, if you could get a smaller with big sound, that would be better.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.280]   So we'll just have to wait and hear what they sound like.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280]   They look fine.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   They look good.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   The good news.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.680]   I'm amazing on the ad.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.480]   The thing that I'm really happy about, they support not just YouTube music.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   Interesting.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.480]   They didn't mention YouTube music.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.960]   They didn't mention Google Play, but it does support that.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   And Pandora and Spotify.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.480]   And so that is all very good news.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.880]   Google is not saying it's just us.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.320]   Also I Heart Radio and TuneIn.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.080]   So you can listen to us.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.520]   TuneIn is what allows Amazon Echo users to listen to all of our stuff.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.760]   You just ask for whatever you want on TuneIn.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.600]   I Heart Radio is a radio.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.600]   So it lists Netflix.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.760]   How is it Netflix?
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.040]   That's because you can say Play.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.600]   Notice Stranger Things had a big role at this event for some reason.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   You can say, Play Stranger Things on my living room TV.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.840]   That will require Chromecast.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.000]   So that bit has Chromecast just add functionality.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.840]   Didn't they just add?
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.680]   You can do new things with Chromecast like assistance.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.720]   Yeah, but it doesn't have a microphone.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.880]   So you need some other words.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.480]   They've always talked about the sick Google I/O.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   They talk about the sick Google I/O.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.720]   Now what they did show, hold on, they did show something cool.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.880]   I think that was today.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.440]   They showed my front door from my Nest Cam and that would pop up on your Chromecast.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   They promised that again on June on the Google I/O.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   They promised that.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   They did.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.240]   But they now, I guess, they will do that.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:13.000]   As long as they do everything they promise, which isn't a guarantee, this is a nice ecosystem.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.280]   If you're all in on Google and you get Nest and you get assistance everywhere, you have
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.960]   a Pixel phone, you have a Chromecast enabled, everything, your house will be pretty responsive
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   to you.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:32.760]   Now Nest has indoor camera, indoor camera, indoor camera, yes.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.960]   And security system and thermostat.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.480]   Yep, right?
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.360]   And the smoke detectors.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.960]   Right, smoke detectors too, right?
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.120]   Don't forget the smoke detectors.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   And the video doorbell, they're competing with Ring.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.560]   They have something called the Nest Hello video doorbell that's coming next year.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:57.600]   Yeah, but this is really, this is to get you into that whole, this is, this, we're going
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.680]   to try to, they offered us a Rick Osterlo, who's head of hardware at Google and took
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.400]   the stage this morning.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.920]   They, Google sent me an email saying we'd like to get Rick, Rick, on one of your shows.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.840]   So we'll, I mentioned this show, I mentioned the three different venues.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.480]   He wanted to be on Twitter on the Sunday show.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.440]   I said, that's actually not a good place for him because we won't have a chance to really
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   talk to him.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.240]   So I mentioned Twig, all about Android, our new Tech News Weekly, which is a newsmaker
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.320]   interview show and the new screensavers.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   And I'm just going to let Rick decide what he wants to do, but we will get him.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.120]   No, you should tell him to come on this one.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.720]   It should be on this one because of you, Stacey, because, because of the, because of the internet
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.240]   of, no, because of the internet of things thing.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.320]   But boy, this is Rick because it is her middle name after all.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.760]   Stacey internet of things, he can buff them.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.800]   That's actually how I mentioned her.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.080]   This is an ecosystem and he's in charge of all hardware now, right?
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.560]   He's not just nest.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.680]   He's, I mean, he isn't in class nest, right?
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.560]   It's not just, he came, he was in Motorola when Google acquired Motorola.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.960]   He ushered the Moto X and I'm, that's where I first met him.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.240]   Nice guy, smart guy.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.160]   And I think this is, this is what he's been charged with.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.800]   Make this all work across the ecosystem.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.440]   I like it.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.880]   Do you think Stacey?
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.360]   I should just throw everything out, all the smart things, all the Amazon's, all the Sonos's
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.120]   and just line the home with Google.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.280]   I mean, if you want to.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.760]   Yes, follow me to the line.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.160]   I see the advantage though, because if we want to see how we learn the syntax of that
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.000]   assistant, everything will work.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.240]   So I would say it, you should probably go all in on Google, Google homes, Google assistant.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.960]   So the Google home devices as opposed to the echo.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.960]   Because it's confusing.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.360]   It is confusing and their home ecosystem is much better.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   Wow.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   That's a big deal.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.840]   Well, but they don't have anything like the echo show.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.400]   I can't.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   They don't.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.640]   Of course, my TV can, I tried it yesterday.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.040]   You know, I have an Nvidia shield, which they just updated of version six.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.240]   It has assistant.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.440]   So I pressed my shield remote and I said, what's the weather going to be like this weekend?
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.560]   It turned on my stereo receiver, my AV receiver.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:18.120]   It turned on the shield, turn on my stereo receiver, turn on my TV and display the weather
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.040]   and said it's going to be 78 degrees and sunny.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.040]   How long did I take?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.040]   I took a long time.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   I took a long time.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.760]   But if your TV were already on, if you are, I mean, yes, because it had to do a lot of,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   but it did it.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.840]   That's what's interesting using CEC and all that is.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:39.600]   So I probably wouldn't go all in on the smart home devices with Nest to be honest.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.160]   I find them very expensive for what they are.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   I like my ring stuff.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   See, this is the problem.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.880]   I've invested a lot in ring.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.880]   I've invested a lot in EKG.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.200]   Well, the ring is going to come to Google.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   Right.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   Ring and Google, they already did announce will work.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.560]   So okay.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:59.720]   And then, you know, I am not, I am not ever putting an automatic lock on my door.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.240]   That seems like a recipe for disaster.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   Okay.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.760]   You use the August locks on your front door?
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.960]   My front doors are weird.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.160]   They're multi point locks.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.440]   So I have an August lock on my back door and I have a.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.840]   Don't you worry that somebody could hack your back door?
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.600]   You know, it beforehand, if you wanted to kick my door in at the back door, locks are
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.080]   just a suggestion.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.000]   They're just an indicator that please don't come in here.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Because really.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.880]   And I had a couple of years ago when I had those hacker people come to my house and hack,
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.760]   hack my house after I gave them my Wi-Fi password.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.760]   They had locked and unlocked my back door and I was kind of like, "Hmm, that's so freaky."
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   I don't know.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.960]   Because you know, you make an excellent point.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.320]   You break the window and open it or you kick the door in.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:54.880]   Locks have never really been fully secure unless you have a metal door and I mean, you
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.680]   have to really do a lot of structural stuff to keep it completely.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.080]   Can you see my dog?
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   Look at her.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.000]   She's, can you, I guess you can't see her.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   She's all on her back.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Okay.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   She's on the door.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   That's all.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.680]   You're going to go to the left again.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.920]   There's a sweetie.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   Is she alive?
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.320]   Yeah, that's what she does.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   She just does that.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.680]   Is she hoping you'll go over and scratch her?
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   No, she does.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   She gets it.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.840]   That's just how she likes to lay.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.920]   It's more comfortable that way.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   I don't know.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920]   Is that comfy?
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   I'm sure she's not as incorrect.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   Yeah, you sure she's.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   She blinked.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   She blinked.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.920]   She's kind of tonic.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   Okay.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   So what's her name?
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920]   She's dog-atonic.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   Sophie on her back.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.280]   That's the name of the show.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.640]   All right.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:52.520]   So the max, the mini, the home, now we get something new with the home.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.200]   Do they just do color things?
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   There's nothing.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   There's nothing new.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.720]   So the mini is the mini home and the max is the maximum home.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   Good.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.040]   But they're all home devices, which is interesting.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.080]   It's really that is now a product line.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.240]   I think it's a good way to think of it.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   They've got the mini.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.960]   They didn't include the Nest stuff here on the Google store page.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   Just go ahead and integrate it.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.880]   All she'll always in charge.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.080]   The fact that they keep Nest separate is kind of silly to me.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   Can't you go to home?
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.320]   Let me see if I go to home and entertainment.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.320]   Can't you get Nest?
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.000]   Yeah, you can get Nest stuff here.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   You do, okay.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Oh, I see.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.760]   It's in the home and entertainment.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.000]   In fact, on that page, this is the lineup.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.960]   Google mini, Google home, Google max, Google Wi-Fi, Chromecast.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.080]   Ultra, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Nest Thermostat, Nest Protect, Nest Cam IQ, Nest Cam and Door,
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   Nest Cam Outdoors.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.360]   So it really is the full range.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.040]   Does having Google Wi-Fi in any way help?
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.400]   I don't think so.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.280]   In fact, I do not particularly like Google Wi-Fi.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.680]   I think there are other better mesh systems.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.280]   We use plume and the Iro.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.520]   I think the Orbeezer better.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.640]   I was surprised that Google said it was the number one selling mesh Wi-Fi system.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   That was two.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.520]   I didn't really dig deeply into that.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.200]   Kevin and I were IAMming back and forth and I was like, really?
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.040]   He's like, it's available at retail stores and it has the Google brand name.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.440]   He has one and he likes it.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   So where he has the--
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   It's adequate.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.960]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.200]   I like it.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.400]   You use it?
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.800]   I'm not going to buy five of them and compare them.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.840]   Yeah, that's what I did.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.040]   And that's why that's where you wrote plume.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:29.840]   But I feel like I don't think there's any reason that you need it.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.240]   They didn't make any case for that.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.040]   It's just another one product.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.680]   But if there is, I'd love to hear about it.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.240]   And we'll ask Rick that.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.200]   That's one of the things we can ask Rick.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.000]   So now we get to the thing that--
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Well, let's take a break.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.360]   And then we do, we're going to get to the thing that Jeff is most interested in.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   Yes.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   Jeff.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.040]   Oh, Jeff, you're a good color now.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   Oh, hey.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.280]   I did some more adjustments.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.280]   He went balance.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   He had some color in your face.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.280]   Nice.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   You got a quick tan.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   I'm sure--
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   I'm the president.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   Oh, you little spray orange?
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   Yeah, little spray.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   That's good.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   That does it.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   Amazing.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280]   Jeff, you're warm and I'm cool.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   So it balances out.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.960]   Well, it's true, too.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.120]   You wouldn't think going to France, you'd get a tan, but I think I did actually get a
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   little color.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120]   Yeah, you did.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   Well, I wasn't Provence.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.480]   That's sunny down there.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.000]   We experienced the Mistral.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.640]   The famous wind that drove Van Gogh crazy.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.360]   I understand why.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   Went for three days.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.160]   It's just constant, strong wind.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.680]   It's extremely annoying.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.040]   But then it's a stopped one day and everything was-- the skies were blue and clear and it
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   was beautiful the rest of the time.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.600]   And I was actually really glad.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.440]   We walked in Vincent's footsteps.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.920]   You don't want to wear as little yellow house was.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.960]   We had a drink in the night cafe that he painted with the pool table and stuff.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.480]   We had a cup of coffee there.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.120]   Our guide said it's fine to have a drink there.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.920]   Don't eat there.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   It's still there.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.320]   It's painted yellow still.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.720]   We went to the asylum where he ended his days.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:10.080]   And everywhere they-- in Arl and Avignon that they do that, they have his paintings positioned
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.320]   on outside where they were painted.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.360]   So you could say, oh, yeah.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   There's the mountain.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.240]   It's really-- I was actually kind of moved.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.680]   It was really beautiful.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.960]   I was really glad to be able to do that actually.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.280]   How did I get on that?
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   I apologize.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   That was a digression which was--
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280]   It was my fault.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.080]   It was something about you going in France and the color of your skin.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.080]   Yeah, it was my job.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.080]   I brought it up.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   We're doing an ad.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   Sorry.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   I brought it up.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.080]   I brought it up.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.480]   My friends, our show today, is brought to you quite literally by Sonic.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.560]   We actually have the best internet connection in the world here.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.960]   Well, at least I feel pretty good about 10 gigabit symmetric internet fiber from Sonic,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.000]   the best internet provider in the country.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.880]   I hate doing these ads because most of you can't get Sonic.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:05.760]   But if you're in the North Bay or if you're in the San Francisco Bay area, please do yourself
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.400]   a favor and get Sonic.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.560]   Sonic's mission is to bring internet freedom to all with unlimited, uncapped internet from
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.480]   a provider that stands up for you.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.920]   That delivers residential and business fiber to the premise networks, gigabit connectivity.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.720]   Let's look at what you get.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.120]   You get a gigabit down.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.760]   You get 15 email accounts, a gigabyte of storage.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.960]   You get personal web hosting.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   You get a new domain.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.280]   You get fax line service.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.000]   You get a home phone connection that's really a home landline phone with unlimited local and
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.080]   long distance calling.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.360]   It's easy to switch to port your number over from your current carrier so you won't even
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.680]   lose your phone number.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:50.200]   You get all of that for $40 a month.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   What I love about it and the reason I want to tell you about it is because this is placing
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.080]   a drawing online in the sand and saying, "You can do this."
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:04.880]   What those big cable companies and phone companies you're charging you is outrageous.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:10.600]   You can get a gigabit for $40 a month, sonic.com/twit.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.960]   They have no bandwidth caps.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.640]   If you go look at the EFF ISP rating card, green checks across the board, they stand
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.480]   up to government requests.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.560]   They do everything right.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.560]   They stand up for privacy.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.400]   They have friendly and local customer support, uncapped bandwidth, affordable pricing, and
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.520]   they make a living.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.640]   It's a profitable, successful company.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.120]   This just puts the lie to everything else.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.240]   Those other guys are telling you, "Get the best.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.280]   Go to sonic.com/twit and join the internet revolution.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.560]   Receive your first month of sonic, internet, and phone service free plus bundle it with
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   dish.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.640]   Get the TV too and you'll save $120 on your sonic bill.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.040]   Sonic.com/twit.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   Thank you, Sonic.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   Thank you for gigabit.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.040]   10 gigabit.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:02.280]   By the way, nothing in this building can use 10 gigabits.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.640]   The best we can do is a gigabit, but I love it.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.400]   All my devices are gigabit.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.800]   It's not just me.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.320]   We have all the, everybody's uploading and editors are working and no slowdowns at all.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.320]   It's just marvelous.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   I just...
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.320]   40 bucks.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   How do they do that?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.520]   I interviewed Dane Jasper, the founder and CEO.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   He's actually an old friend.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   I've known him for years.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.840]   His license plate says Linux.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.840]   I love that.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.520]   He said, "No, we make money.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.880]   If we get one in five in the neighborhood, one in five of the people living in the neighborhood
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.600]   to subscribe, we make money."
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.760]   I want to come to New Jersey.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   I know.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.280]   I do think that Dane's ambition is to slowly roll it out across the United States.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.760]   He really has wanted to do that.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.120]   That's been his ambition for like seven years though.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   Yeah, it's hard to do.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   I'm still waiting.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   I know very hard.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.880]   So in addition to the capital costs, like a lot of...
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   Dane has similar capital costs, but he doesn't have unionized workers.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:02.640]   And if you look at the infrastructure behind Comcast or Verizon, his company is much smaller
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.240]   from that perspective.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.640]   And then a lack of union workers helps and pension workers.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:14.480]   So less so Comcast, but the older telcos, they just find that hard to believe.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.640]   They still have people on pensions.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.640]   My father-in-law is on an AT&T pension.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   Well, actually that's the blight of a lot of old companies, including all our car companies.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.640]   Right.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.840]   Well, I mean that's a huge number of people who are pensioned.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   That is a lot.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.840]   But anyway.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.480]   It's a promise they made.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.080]   They got to do it.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.600]   And you see some of those companies not.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.840]   And I think that's really criminal.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   In fact, a lot of public groups.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.600]   Well, they don't have the funds.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   They can't.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.480]   Firefighters, police, they can't.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   And then they stop.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.440]   And I think that's a breach of promise.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.440]   It's sad.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.440]   Anyway.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.880]   We are not going to solve pension problems today.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.880]   That is true.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.820]   Well, I remember when my friend Drew Curtis was running for Governor of Kentucky, the
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.360]   guy from FARC.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.560]   He said this is the crisis that is unacknowledged that Kentucky is going to face.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.640]   They have pension obligations.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.040]   They cannot meet this year without going bankrupt.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.800]   And this is the problem.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.240]   And none of the other candidates would even mention it.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.840]   Your family's home.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.400]   Is there a baby?
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   Or Sophie.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.040]   She's barking at the door.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   Sophie said, yep.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.040]   See, I hear Andrew.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   Yep.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   There's my family is home.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   Family's home.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   Good.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   I was saved from the boredom of being with mom.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.760]   I was I was catatonic dog at tonic on the floor.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.160]   I can't wait to your home.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   Oh, thank goodness.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.320]   Let me out of here.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.560]   Why did they trap me in here?
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.800]   She's so cute because Jeff Jarvis made a.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.360]   Jeff is Jeff is sorry.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.920]   I mean, I know what breed she is.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.120]   She's a much she's a much she's really sweet.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   We rescued her.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.000]   Exactly the size Lisa wants.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.360]   Lisa wants to get another dog and she's a.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.360]   She like mine.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.920]   Yeah, we'll take Sophie.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.920]   She's sweet.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   You love so.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.400]   Don't say that.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   Don't say that.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.320]   She's also a beautiful color.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.520]   She's yes, she's nice.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.880]   She's stubborn and she's loud.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.880]   Like me.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.160]   Oh, hey.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.680]   I told her we can get a dog if it's 10 years old.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.920]   I want an older dog.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.200]   I like the pet insurance system.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   So Jeff was waiting.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   Jeff loves his.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.640]   I was waiting his Chromebook.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   I do indeed.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.880]   I'm on my hands on my pixel right now.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   I have two.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.080]   I have three pixels.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   It's super anuated.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.720]   There's another great word.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.280]   It's you are just a doctorable tabular today.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.160]   We need a glossary for the show.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.320]   Super annuated is a fancy way of saying old.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   But it's a night.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   I like the word super anuated.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.560]   It's a good word.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.400]   It's yeah.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.680]   You're just you like me.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.840]   You have no you have the first generation.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   No, that's Jason.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   I was first and second.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   I was two seconds.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   I was first.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.840]   Okay.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   So one of the reasons we all bought Chromebook pixels is because it had i5 Intel processors.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.080]   It had lots of RAM.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.960]   But they weren't cheap and they're not cheap this time.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.800]   This is the new Chrome Pixelbook from Google.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.640]   But I think Google might have overpriced this once again.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   $9.99 for the base unit.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.440]   It is a convertible.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.240]   That means you can use it as a laptop.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   You can fold over the screen and use it as a tablet.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.200]   You can tent it.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.640]   They do now offer a pen and we'll talk about that.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.480]   That's a separate $100 add on.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:51.160]   It is a 12.3 inch screen and it's the first laptop with Google Assistant built in.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.600]   To the point that it has a Google Assistant button.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.280]   Although when it's folded over, it will listen for the okay, you know who.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.360]   So if you don't want to talk to it, you can press the button and type to it.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.960]   I like seeing this because it feels like Google Assistant is now the future voice for Google.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.000]   They're just going to make this be everywhere.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.600]   It does support Android and they mentioned, I was glad to see that Adobe, who was it?
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   No Snapchat was going to make a special Adobe Android placed or version of Snapchat for
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.320]   the Pixel that would use the full screen.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.840]   10.3 millimeter thick.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   Very, very thin.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.200]   All aluminum unibody.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   2.4 pounds.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   Yep.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.800]   Just a kilogram.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:45.240]   So this is pretty sweet until you get to the price.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:52.280]   9.99 gets you a i5 with 8 gigs of RAM and a 128 gig hard drive.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.840]   $200 more, you get double the size of the hard drive.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   That's all.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.800]   I'm kind of regretting paying that now because who needs a big hard drive and a Chromebook?
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   If you're going to use it to, I know, same here, if you're going to use it to, I use
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.520]   Google Play to watch all my shows.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.080]   So you download them?
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   Then I use Netflix and I use Amazon.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.120]   And so I download a lot onto my Pixel C.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.600]   But even then, 128 gigs would probably be enough, I would guess.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.600]   That's a lot.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.200]   I mean, you'd have to be kind of diligent about clicking things off.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:36.040]   Then, if you really think, oh, a thousand bucks isn't enough, I want to spend $1,700.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.600]   You could put an i7 in here, 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.080]   I wish the middle one had 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   Same here.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.080]   That's the one thing that was two things.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   It was me off.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   That pisses me off.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   I want 16 gigs.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.080]   And five to 12 gigabyte, but you can't get that right now.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   Remember the old days when you could actually just add memory on that nice?
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   Yeah, I do.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.960]   But I'm old enough to.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   But those were not 10 millimeter thick machines.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.120]   No, they were not.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.000]   So just looking at the pictures, type C connectors as before on the left and the right, that's
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.480]   handy because you could charge it on either side.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.760]   It has a...
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.040]   Stay on that picture for a second.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.440]   On off button here.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.960]   What is this button, a volume?
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:16.960]   Maybe.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.960]   Well, let's go ahead.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   And then a headphone jack.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   I don't know.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.360]   This is a longer button here.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.600]   So on that picture, Leo?
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.600]   That's what fooled the...
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   What is this thing?
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   The rumors.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.600]   That's just a shadow.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   I know.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   Maybe not.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.000]   And the thought was that the keyboard was going to slide underneath.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Pixel phone.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.600]   One thing I don't like about this is in tablet mode.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.880]   I know I'm going to knock keys off.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.720]   I did that originally with one of the...
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.880]   Another machine I had.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.440]   And the flip around 180, I don't like much.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.440]   I like to fix this.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.880]   Lenovo convertible.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.760]   This technology, despite what Google calls it, they call it a 4-in-1, isn't called 4-in-1
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   in general.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.400]   It's called convertible.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.320]   And I have a convertible Lenovo X1 Yoga.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.120]   And it retracts the keys as you flip it over.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.440]   That's what I want.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.680]   But the negative on that is it means that the hinge is a little creaky because you have
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.880]   to do more with it.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.400]   It's physically retracting me.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.560]   Or the Microsoft model or...
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.680]   I mean, there's lots of different models, but they're not my least favorite.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   It's that.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.040]   I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   So I don't like it all uses it now.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:39.120]   And with the chrome, they sold the Pixel in Best Buy for a month and obviously they
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.120]   had staff there.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.440]   The only people are going to buy this is you and me.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.160]   I already did it.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   Pretty much.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:52.560]   Now I'm getting buyers remorse that I should have gotten the 128.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.320]   Me too.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.800]   If only they'd put 16.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.640]   I'd have been making so much middle one.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   That would be the right...
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.400]   Then that would be the sweet spot.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:10.600]   The pen is not unlike the Samsung Chromebook Plus or Pro where the pen is thinner and smaller
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.640]   and embedded, it has a little slot.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.240]   The pen is just a standalone pen.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.960]   It isn't even like the Microsoft pen which has a magnet.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.040]   I don't think it has a magnet on the side so you don't lose it.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.840]   It's just like you're going to put it in your pocket pen.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:30.320]   But the good news about the pen is it is a Wacom style.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   It is from Wacom.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.640]   Like the screen and the pen.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.640]   Wacom or Wacom?
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   I've never known.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.640]   They said Wacom.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.920]   I think it's Wacom.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.160]   But they said Wacom.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   What's Stacy?
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.160]   Stacy yawning?
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.160]   No, no, no.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.160]   She...
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.160]   No.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   My sonos is updating.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.160]   Oh!
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   Oh!
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.160]   Oh, that's for your sonos.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.160]   You too.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   Oh, jealous.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   She's just so jealous.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.160]   I'm going to go home.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.400]   I want to go home right now.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.160]   I've been checking throughout the show.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   I'm like, "Come on!"
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.880]   I'm going to go home right now.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.960]   You don't have sonos?
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   No.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.960]   I surprised Jeff.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   I thought you would.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   Oh.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   All the smart kids do.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.240]   Because it was so when it came out, it was so damn expensive.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   It is.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   It's ridiculous.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.560]   And in one way, that's why I'm thrilled that Sonos finally just did something right
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.240]   because it was starting to look like I was going to have to sell my Sonos stuff and buy
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.680]   all Apple HomePods or now that they...
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.720]   Home Max from Google.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.040]   Maybe all of those.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.320]   Solid State NVMe drive means a very fast drive.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.440]   Having a seventh generation Intel processor, even the i5 is plenty.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.920]   That's really fast.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   Lots of RAM.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.920]   Okay.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   That's good.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:45.560]   This will be the best Chromebook, but you will pay the premium price for this thing.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.560]   The pen has...
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   I mean...
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   2,000 levels of pressure.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   It's very...
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.960]   It's just what you want, frankly.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.320]   And they say 10 hours of battery use.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.200]   The Pixel had excellent battery life.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.160]   So I'm going to count on that.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   I still...
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   Well, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:10.960]   So I just need to have the best Chromebook because that's what I live on.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.440]   What I don't know is whether I'm going to travel with it.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   Number one, because I still...
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   I like...
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.000]   Yes, I don't know, but it's bigger.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   I like my Pixel...
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   But if I'm on the subway and I want to turn over and watch something, that versus the Pixel
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.440]   C, I think the Pixel C is better or plain even.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.680]   I don't want to ruin the keys.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.160]   So I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.840]   I'll be whining about this for a few weeks after we get it.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.840]   Here's the pen.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.960]   It's the only pen that works with the Google Assistant.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.960]   They demoed that.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.960]   I thought that was cool.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   You circle a word.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.960]   It'll give you the definition.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   The assistant goes, "Oh, you want to know what that is?"
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   It'll give you the definition.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.240]   You circle a face.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.720]   It will look that person up with Google Image Search, which is very cool.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.480]   If you're sensitive, tilt support, they say virtually no lag.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   That's always an issue with artists.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:05.840]   Both Apple, especially on the iPad Pro and with their pencil and Microsoft with its surface
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.880]   pencil, have done a very good job of making it almost very close to really drawing.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.040]   That's really what artists want.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.240]   When you draw, it feels like that's ink coming out of the pen.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.880]   We'll see if Google can do that.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.040]   That's one of the reasons, though, that you want to put a fast processor and lots of RAM
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   in there.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.800]   It says Edge to Edge.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.640]   Trackpad, what does that mean?
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.400]   They say they're doing a better trackpad.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   We'll see.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400]   I don't know.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.200]   This trackpad is not traditionally very good on Chromebooks.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:39.560]   By the way, the pen uses a replaceable quadruple A battery.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.560]   It's not rechargeable.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   Just --
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   A quadruple A battery?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.760]   They have like triple A's only smaller.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   Oh.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   That means that.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   I don't know.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   How do you say it?
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Four A's?
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   A battery?
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   Yes.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   I don't know.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   Is this common?
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.760]   I've never counted common.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.000]   It's not common, but it's widely available.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.920]   Is it common for a laptop to have a gyroscope and a magnetometer?
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.080]   No.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.080]   Not to my knowledge.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.560]   Why would they have that?
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.560]   Because of Android apps.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.920]   The Android apps expect the features of an Android phone.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.920]   Okay.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   Yes.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.240]   And one of them, of course, gyroscope is so you know the position of it.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.320]   The magnetometer, whether that's a compass, right?
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.320]   Yes.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.000]   So it would be for nav, I guess.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.040]   It doesn't have a GPS though.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.600]   It also doesn't have LTE, which disappoints me regularly.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   It does have automatic --
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.080]   Well, they did the right thing if you have -- but you have to have a pixel.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:37.880]   If you are using a pixel, it senses it, it knows it, and will automatically turn -- put
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.440]   the pixel in hotspot mode and connect through the --
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.760]   And you have to have a pixel that's not on an AT&T grandfather account that won't let
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.920]   you tether.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.320]   I said whiny.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   I'm whiny.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.760]   Yeah, you should be on Google fine.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:58.160]   Oh, all Windows UltraBooks have gyros for rotation.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.800]   That's where you have the gyros for rotation.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   Well, right.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   Okay, right.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   Right.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   Thank you.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   So when you -- that makes sense.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.440]   So when you rotate it, it knows which way's up.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   That makes sense.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   I don't know what the magnetometer is for.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440]   I would guess it's a compass.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.440]   Oh, here.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   Oh, don't guess.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   We'll Google.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   Why guess?
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   Don't guess.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   It's a big word, Leo.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   You should just know it.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.000]   Well, I know what it is.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Magnetometer.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   It's just a measure of magnetism.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   So it's a compass.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   It's a compass.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   A compass.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   What does it do?
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.040]   No, that's the question is what more does -- why would you have --
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.480]   They're used in the military to detect submarines, probably not.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.280]   Oh, now you can detect submarines with your Chromebook pixel or your picture with a Chrome
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.280]   or --
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   All right.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.040]   So it creates a miniature Hall of X sensor that detects the Earth's magnetic field along
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.820]   three perpendicular axes and it produces --
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.820]   A compass.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:55.820]   Right.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   I know.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.820]   Hold on.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:03.280]   Well, a compass only has one axis.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.720]   It's crucial for detecting the orientation of your device relative to the Earth's magnetic
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   north.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.320]   So the gyro and the magnetic work together.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.640]   It's about orientation somehow.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   Device precipitates.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:21.400]   This will be a beautiful -- this is why Google does the pixel in general, the pixel books
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   is to show what can be done with Chrome OS.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.800]   Well, they finally have that mid-range machine that we wanted in the $500 Samsung converter.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.120]   I like the Samsung.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.560]   I bought a couple of those.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.560]   So we wanted --
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.560]   Can we talk about --
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.100]   Can we talk about how I feel it is misleading of Google to keep -- they called it a laptop
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.720]   so many times during this thing.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.440]   And it is not a laptop.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.320]   It is not accidental to call it a laptop.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.280]   They're really trying to emphasize that a Chromebook is a laptop.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   I can't -- no, but it's not.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.080]   I can't do things like run my Audacity program.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.080]   Stacey.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.520]   Stacey, you can do 99% of what you need.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   Okay.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.320]   I spend like 10 hours a week.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   Audacity.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.320]   Programming.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   No.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.320]   Try -- Oh, no.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.320]   I can't do it.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.960]   So try the Android app, Ophonic.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   And see.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:20.720]   More Android and Chrome extensions that will allow you to do some of the things.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   I agree with you.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:28.200]   I mean, I'm -- the main reason I still use an all-purpose laptop is because I want to
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.160]   do photos, right?
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.160]   Photo editing.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.760]   Well, in the price -- And there's polar and there's stuff, but it's not quite --
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   It's priced like a laptop.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   It's not quite -- I agree.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.760]   But that's my big point.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.760]   It is not a laptop.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.760]   That's exactly my point.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.320]   You go in the store and you're going to see even Windows laptops are $500.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.080]   You're going to see all these things in the $500 to $800 range.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.560]   And then $999 in all these is Chrome OS.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.760]   I think it's going to confuse people.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.840]   But if you are all in, if you get Chromebooks, you'll love it.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.840]   But the real market for Chromebooks is schools and businesses that don't want to spend a
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   lot of money, they want something simple to manage, they don't want any viruses.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.840]   That isn't somebody who's going to spend a thousand bucks or more on a laptop or a Chromebook,
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.840]   I don't think.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   Right.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.840]   I'm so with you.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.080]   Look at this thing and I'm like, some people might even buy it and be pissed when they figure
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.080]   out the limitations.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   Because --
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.880]   That's the only real -- I don't think Google cares if they sell a lot.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.360]   They know they're not going to sell a lot.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.600]   Stacey, I also know people who just say, "Thank goodness, all the hassle is gone."
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   New OS is installing crap, all this stuff.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.880]   It depends on how you're using a machine.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.400]   Most people aren't even issuing podcasts or editing audio.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.520]   Most people are doing Microsoft Office stuff.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   So this is the equivalent of that.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.520]   I'll give you an example.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:46.080]   When I get up and I have breakfast and there's -- I open up a laptop.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:51.040]   But all I ever really do is I do my news beat checks, I surf all the news sites, answer
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.800]   email, see what's been going on.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.040]   Maybe look at a YouTube video.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.720]   That is all possible on a Chromebook.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.640]   Chromebook is my breakfast laptop.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.880]   It is not my work laptop where I have to get something done.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.520]   It's not my photo editing laptop.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.920]   But for most people, if they're not doing podcasts or editing photos --
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   Why would they spend that kind of money?
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   You could buy it.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   It is a lot.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:20.440]   Because, Stacey, this is the speed matters.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.360]   Especially before there was a $500 Chromebook, if you had a $200 or $300 Chromebook, it was
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.840]   not capable of having tons of tabs open.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.480]   It wouldn't work well.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.720]   But this machine works incredibly well.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.120]   This is -- I've been on a Pixel since they started.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:42.480]   So the two-deck year of three years I had with Sundar Pichai when the first CR48 Black
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.480]   Chromebook came out.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.960]   And I said, "Sunder, I don't understand why anybody buy this when you could get a computer,
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.640]   a full computer for the same price."
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:56.120]   This is also, Stacey, I don't argue this, for people who -- for the post-computer world,
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.440]   where all you have is a phone.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.960]   This makes a lot of sense.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   Okay.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.080]   The post-computer world better not rely solely on me looking at my phone.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.080]   The post-computer world we're finally getting to.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.440]   And it's going to be things like my computers.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.040]   You see, actually, Google did such a great job showing this off.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:17.680]   It's things like, "Show me this," and it pops up on a screen that's useful, or "Circle
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:24.480]   something with my pen on my exorbitantly expensive, not laptop," and "Tell me the information
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.480]   I need."
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.800]   So I see what you're saying.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.840]   I feel like the marketing around it is not good.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:36.640]   The marketing -- calling it a laptop when it's not a laptop and then pricing a Chromebook
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.000]   so high just feels.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Snob.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   And a lot of -- Snob.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.560]   Not a snob.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.520]   I just have programs I need to run, man.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:51.880]   And I think about my daughter who does video editing for fun in giggles because she's a
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.600]   tween girl.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.360]   And -- She's going to have Snapchat on her new Chromebook.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   Oh, Lord.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   Oh, Lord.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:04.320]   And by the way, you get snaps -- once you get Android, you get Photoshop -- I mean, Lightroom
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:11.040]   Mobile, you get Snap Seed, you get plenty of great tools in Android.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:18.440]   And if companies like Adobe and Snap decide, you know, see that this is a form factor that
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:22.560]   we're going to want to support, they'll make their software automatically fill the screen,
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.560]   they'll use it.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.480]   And that's exactly what Google said on the stage.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.880]   Snap is going to make Snapchat for the Pixelbook.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.600]   What's going to cause you to put it -- Can we talk about fragmentation?
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   No, this is --
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   Stuff like that.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.680]   I mean -- This is inherently part of fragmentation.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:37.680]   With Android?
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.680]   No, there's no fermentation.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   What do you talk about?
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.800]   I'm like, my God, now you're going to have to have two different apps.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.000]   One for the phone for a factor, one for the -- They already have.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Well, yes.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.560]   That is an issue, Stacey.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.440]   And where it's most awkward now is when I'm -- let's say I'm on the Washington Post,
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.800]   and I want to tweet an article there.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.600]   When I hit the Twitter, it opens up -- and I wanted to just go to the web Twitter situation.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:05.440]   It opens up the Android -- App is up the Android Twitter app, and it doesn't work.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:09.360]   So I have to close that.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:17.760]   And I still can't find where I take off those defaults of going to the Android app instead
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.480]   of the web, which is what I want.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:26.160]   I live in fear of clicking always and never being able to go back on things that I care
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.160]   about.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.160]   That's very awkward.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.160]   I live in fear of clicking.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:34.760]   That's my web story right there.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   I'm with you, though.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   I agree.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.520]   I hate how it defaults to why aren't you using the app?
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.600]   I'm like, shut up if I wanted to use the app.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   Exactly.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   Exactly.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.600]   And it pushes that too much.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.040]   So that's still very awkward.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.040]   That's not great.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:51.160]   And so it's not ready for saying, oh, but all the Android is on there.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.400]   It doesn't work perfectly yet.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.400]   And I don't know that it ever will.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.400]   We'll see.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:01.080]   Look at Google highlights for apps on their page.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:06.040]   This is on the store page for the -- they show all the Android apps in productivity.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.120]   For creativity, AutoCAD, infinite pater, Jamboard, Lightroom, Sketchbook.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   It's interesting.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   They don't mention a snap seed.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:18.840]   For entertainment, Google Play, music, Instagram, Netflix, YouTube, Snow Accident.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:24.600]   They made a big deal about Netflix because that brings movies to your Chromebook and works
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:31.000]   with Pixelbook Pen, only two programs so far, Sketchbook and Squid.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   But the two is enough.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.560]   I mean, it's -- you know, it would be nice to have more, certainly the iPad.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.480]   I want some note-taking.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   Those aren't note-taking ones.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   I want --
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.280]   They talked about that as a use case.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.600]   So I imagine there will be.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.520]   I would -- I am -- you know what?
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.400]   Both Jeff and I will be using these, Stacey, and we'll get back to you.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   I agree.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.840]   I think the price is on the biggest negative.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:53.840]   The price.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.360]   But it's the same for the -- it was exactly the same for the last Chromebook.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.360]   It's no different.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.360]   Yep.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   And I don't think they sold a lot of Chromebook pixels to be honest.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.360]   No, they didn't.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.360]   And I don't think they care about them.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:05.080]   But the people who have them love them and are devoted to them and are much --
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.080]   Stacey is absolutely right.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.920]   And best buy this thing going to sell it all.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   All right.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   Come back.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   We'll talk about the phones.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.520]   And kind of a surprise.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.280]   Most of this -- the rumor mill was very right on about.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.640]   But they missed two -- not sort of missed.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.040]   They mentioned that they thought there would be some earbuds.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.160]   But they missed some of the critical features on the new earbuds.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.480]   And they did completely miss the camera.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.480]   Because --
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   Why did the --
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   Why would Google make a standalone camera?
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.880]   Oh, I have a great -- I have a reason for that.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.880]   So you're going to love it.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.880]   I can't wait.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   Stay tuned.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:48.080]   Because that's coming up on this week in Google with Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.240]   Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMashin.com.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.080]   Our show today brought to you by 23andMe.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   Love these guys.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:02.320]   I did 23andMe way back when they first started -- started by Susan Wojcicki, Esther Wojcicki.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.320]   One of the Jowojcis.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   No.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.520]   By Ann Wojcicki.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.320]   Ann Wojcicki.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.880]   So Esther's the mom.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.720]   Yes.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:15.360]   But her relationship with Google was she rented a garage to Sergei and Larry in the early
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.080]   days of Google.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.280]   And Wojcicki was married to Larry Pei.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.240]   And Ann fell in love with Larry.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.840]   They got married.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.000]   The other daughter Susan runs YouTube.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.040]   So this is all in the family.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.200]   But Ann started this 23andMe.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   And I love it.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.720]   Well, my whole family is doing it now.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.720]   Brilliant family.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   It spread.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.240]   I couldn't -- first came out and I got it.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.880]   They said, "Well, that was a little nutty.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.120]   Now they are fascinated with the data."
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.320]   Well, everybody spit into a tube.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.480]   Once you do it -- yes.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.240]   So that's important to mention.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.480]   Some people might say, "Well, I don't know.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   What do I have to do?
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   Go to a lab?
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   Do I have to give blood?"
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   No.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.480]   They do this all from your saliva.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:56.680]   You spit -- the only hard thing is you have to get enough spit.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.440]   It's a lot of spit.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.680]   It's not that much.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.600]   My father did it.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.040]   He didn't do enough spit the first time.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.320]   So they said, "I'm a freak get to do the spitting again."
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.320]   Oh, that's cute.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.520]   Yeah, you really have to kind of work up the saliva.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.120]   Because that's -- I guess your DNA is in there, right?
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:19.720]   So once you do this in a couple of weeks, they'll say, "Okay, your stuff is up."
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:25.000]   And when I love about this, I did this years ago, but I have all of the benefits because
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.240]   as they've learned more over time, they add more and more to my reports.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.160]   So I now have 100 plus archived reports.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.000]   I have wellness reports, traits, ancestry, DNA, relatives.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.800]   That's really fun.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.160]   That is a really fun one.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:47.960]   They found a second cousin on my grandma's side that I never knew about.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.840]   I just love this.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.520]   You could find out -- here's some of my relatives, right?
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.080]   And it's based on -- now they're doing it and you're doing it.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.120]   You have to give permission, okay?
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:03.240]   So don't worry about somebody finding you that you don't want to find you.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:11.040]   But if everybody gives permission, then you can -- it'll pinpoint some relatives, which
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.840]   is really key.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:18.880]   Also, if your relatives or family does it like Jeff's, you can compare yourself to those
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.200]   people.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.760]   Maybe you'll find out that your mom isn't your mom.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.200]   Who knows?
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   So they did.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.760]   Actually, I shouldn't use that as an example.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.400]   But you know what I'm saying here.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.360]   You can find out stuff.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.200]   I love the ancestry reports.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:37.080]   I am 4% Neanderthal.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:42.600]   That's a good example of something that they didn't know about until recently.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:47.640]   About five years ago, they -- for the first time ever were able to analyze Neanderthal
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.640]   DNA.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.640]   They found some old bones.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.600]   And for a long time, there was a debate among scientists whether we are intermingled with
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:59.520]   Neanderthals or whether homo sapiens could not interbreed and just killed them off.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:05.360]   We now know, thanks to those bones a few years ago, that they did intermingle and we
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.840]   knew what the traits are.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.960]   So this was a report that when I first did 23 of me, they couldn't have given me.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.400]   But they did now.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.360]   I am in seventh place out of my family and friends.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.880]   A lot of my family and friends have more Neanderthal than I do.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:24.560]   But I have 4%, a little less than 4% of my genetic material comes from Neanderthals.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.560]   Isn't that fascinating?
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   You can find out what part of the country your people came from, part of the world your
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.760]   people came from and when.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:39.440]   You can follow your maternal or paternal haplogroup as they migrate.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:49.120]   So 180,000 years ago, my maternal haplogroup, L, was down here in kind of Central Eastern
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:55.040]   Africa, migrated north across into the Middle East and from there into Europe.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.640]   Isn't that cool?
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.920]   I mean, this is just amazing.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920]   This is the kind of stuff.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.060]   Now you do this with your family and your kids.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.720]   Think about what they're going to learn.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.080]   I am related to the cheddar man.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.680]   They're going to learn about, first of all, everybody's fascinated by stuff, right?
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.440]   They're all by themselves, right?
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.920]   So they're going to get naturally engaged in this, but they're going to learn so much
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.400]   about genetics and DNA, the thing that's going to really change our world.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.960]   You can even get access to the raw data.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.480]   So this is, I can actually search for specific markers and chromosomes.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:37.520]   23 and me, this is very reasonable considering what you get.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.400]   Go to 23andme.com/twit right now.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.120]   And can I suggest this as a gift for family members?
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120]   This would be-
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120]   It really works.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120]   It works.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.120]   It's fascinating.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.560]   My daughter was so delighted that she's only 49.9% me.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.360]   She's a majority of her mothers.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.360]   DNA.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.360]   She's been her very happy.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.000]   Well, that's the kind of thing that's really cool, isn't it?
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.840]   Like my kids always are asking how much of me is you and how much of me is mom?
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.760]   And you can now, well, let's find out.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.160]   23andme.com/twit.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.280]   Discover where you come from, who your people are.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.360]   So much fun.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.920]   Really love doing this.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.320]   All right.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.200]   Let's get to the phones.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   Unfortunately.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.200]   Are you going to take calls?
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200]   That's a good idea.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.200]   Let's go to the phones.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.200]   Joe, with New Jersey.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.360]   You're on.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.360]   It's fun.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360]   You know, I do that on the radio show.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360]   I love taking calls.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360]   I wish we could take calls.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.800]   When we first started with some of these shows, we tried different platforms like TalkShoe.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.800]   Oh, wait.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.400]   Kevin, Kevin built one for us on the IoT podcast and he posted a how-to on the website.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.200]   Do you think the live calls during the show?
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.520]   You know, what we do is you send it to us.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.200]   We record it and then, or you will be a message.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200]   You do the Twilio.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.600]   Yeah, it's a Twilio with a Raspberry Pi.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   It's awesome.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   What we used to do-
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   With a double Twilio.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   No, that's fun.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.720]   But what we used to do is actually take live calls.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   That's an interest.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   Someday I might-
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   It would be fun.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.720]   If I could try again.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.720]   You know what?
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.320]   Maybe we could like make once a quarter or once a month do a live call in.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   I think that'd be fun.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.720]   I know I know you guys would love it.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.560]   Our audience would love it.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.680]   So Pixel 2, everything we thought was going to happen did.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.760]   No headphone jack.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.040]   Si.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.040]   No wireless charging.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040]   Si.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   Si.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040]   Somewhat waterproof.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.200]   It's IP67.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.120]   That's really water resistant.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120]   Si.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:45.280]   However, the things that people really love Pixel phones for are here.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.040]   More instance, it's the most secure Android phone because Google keeps it up to date.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.560]   That's great.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.840]   It's really got great integrated support for Google Assistant.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.680]   It's a simple, clean design.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.120]   I'm really glad the XL, the large version, is almost bezel-less but not fully.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.880]   The reason it's not fully is they have front-facing speakers, top and bottom stereo speakers.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.160]   Thank you.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.040]   Really like that.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.840]   One lens.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840]   Go ahead.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.840]   No, I was going to say, somebody I just talked to doesn't use a Sonos or anything.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.480]   They use their smartphone speaker.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.600]   I realized it was Matt Cutts from last week.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600]   Right.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.120]   But you have to have a smartphone speaker.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.680]   This is the way to do it.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.000]   This is the phone for Matt.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.520]   This is the HTC DNA.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.640]   This is the boom sound DNA.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.800]   HTC started this with the M1 and that sounded great.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.480]   I really like the front-facing speakers.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   Nobody else does this.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.680]   In fact, Apple has one cheesy speaker.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.280]   Samsung has one cheesy speaker off the side.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.560]   It's really nice to have front-facing stereo speakers, especially if you ever watch video,
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.320]   which I don't.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   It sounds better.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.040]   We'll see if it sounds as good as a regular speaker.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.360]   Probably doesn't.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.520]   All the flagship phones these days have dual lenses.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]   Apple started it with...
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.840]   Actually, I think LG started it, but Apple was the first really well-known flagship to
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.360]   have a wide and a telephoto.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.040]   They can do a lot of things, portrait mode and so forth.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.320]   But Google was a great pain to say, "We don't need two lenses.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.240]   We need one lens and lots of computational power."
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.520]   They can do portrait mode.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.520]   They don't need both lenses.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.560]   What they do with this camera is they take a lot of images and they change, I guess,
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:34.880]   the focal length and the lighting and then they optimize by mixing images.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.200]   Does that make sense?
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.320]   You're doing this so fast.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.840]   Why do you have to have two lenses?
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.080]   You could do it all with one lens.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.040]   One lens optically image stabilized, F1.8, so it's fairly fast.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.880]   Not the fastest out there, but fairly fast.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:53.040]   And DxO Mark, Google was very happy to say, gave it a 98, the highest score they've ever
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.040]   given.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.560]   I'll take that Apple fan.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560]   I want to keep that.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.560]   Yeah, it's funny because...
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.800]   Didn't the Apple get like a 95?
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   94.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.840]   Yesterday, the iPhone 8 and the Note 8 both were touting that they got 94.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.840]   They tied.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.720]   And I feel like this was a setup because the next day, Google says, "Oh, yeah, well, we
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.120]   got an 98."
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:19.800]   But is there a 101 or is it a stop at 100?
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.960]   I think it must go past 100.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   Oh, the best.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.360]   I mean, we're so close to 100.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360]   I don't know.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360]   Does that mean it's perfect?
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360]   No, there must be a way to go.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.760]   Wait, what is the scale?
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   But we don't know.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.640]   Sorry, what is the scale?
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.640]   What is this measuring?
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.560]   It's DxO Mark.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.920]   They are independent third party.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.120]   They've done this for years.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:47.600]   They make software, so they have a business selling software.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.800]   But they've been for a long time reviewing not just camera phones, but all sensors and
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.040]   all cameras.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:06:00.520]   The Pixel is the highest mobile, but it's got a score as high as the Sony A7R2, which
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.440]   is easily one of the best DSLRs out there.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:05.760]   It's not an SLR.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.240]   It's a mirrorless.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.760]   So I don't know if those are comparable.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.800]   I don't know what the scale is.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.120]   They do lens ratings as well on a different scale.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.720]   I would say they're reliable.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.040]   They're trustworthy, but I wouldn't say it's that meaningful.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.880]   I mean, look at the Google Pixel last year's Pixel was 90.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.560]   The iPhone 7 Plus was 88.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.880]   The iPhone 8 Plus is 94.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.840]   Now the Google Pixel 2 is 98.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.040]   How much better is that?
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.520]   Maybe a little bit.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   Scooch better.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   Scooch better.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520]   I don't know.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.480]   I think the truth is, if you're getting a flagship phone these days, even like an
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.680]   LG V30, you're getting a really excellent camera.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:56.120]   And some do, like they say, the Note 8 is the best smartphone if you want to zoom.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.240]   It's funny because the iPhone 8 Plus, when it was reviewed, said the best smartphone
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.040]   camera we've ever tested.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.680]   But that was all the way back in September.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.320]   So what do you think?
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.800]   So I have my Pixel XL.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.520]   I love my Pixel XL.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.160]   Oh, you should definitely upgrade.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.760]   Okay, so tell me why.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.160]   You always cost me money, Leo.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.840]   I think the biggest thing is that when the Pixel came out, it was a rush job.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:28.280]   Everybody agreed that Google had to kind of make some compromises to get it out the door.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   This is my Pixel XL.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.280]   And I love this, right?
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.280]   It's a great phone.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.720]   But look at the size of the screen, relative to the size of the, there's a big, big bumps
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   at the top and the bottom.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.680]   Those will disappear on the XL too.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:47.480]   This glass window is now smaller, the fingerprint reader is below the glass window.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   And this is a soft touch.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.520]   I think you'll like it better than the metal finish.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.720]   You're going to put a case on it.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   Right.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.480]   835 Snapdragon 835 processor.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.000]   That is a better processor than that.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   I think you have an 820.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.480]   We have an 821 in our Pixel XL.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.000]   Camera I think is going to be the biggest difference.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.840]   I think that here is going to be a noticeable difference in the camera.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:11.360]   Boy, I'm glad I didn't buy a share of smartphones.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.280]   Well, truthfully, the real, the tough one is buying one every year.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.280]   If it's a two year difference, yeah, it's like a no brainer.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.120]   But here's the here's the here's.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.640]   This actually helps.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.480]   I can trade in my Pixel XL and get $410.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.480]   That's a great deal.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.480]   That's a real.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:36.880]   That's a that means that this is now what is a $450 phone, $440 phone.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.840]   That makes it that makes it a lot better.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   That's fantastic.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:46.280]   So if you look at the trade and I should have been able to get a 115 for my Nexus 5 XP or
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:52.160]   5x, except it broke because it was part of that whole flawed LG thing.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:09:00.680]   So a 6P 128 gets you $165.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   That's so great.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.720]   No, that's to the two years.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.160]   A pixel 128 gets you 360.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   Oh, it's oh, it's an estimated.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.560]   Oh, they ask you, does it turn on?
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560]   Yes.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.320]   Does it have any cracks?
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.320]   No.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.920]   Mine's perfect shape.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.920]   Next.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.920]   Can I reset it?
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.920]   Yes.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:28.880]   It's estimated value 230 for this small pixel, but for the XL.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:33.600]   Anyway, if you can get the trade in, I think that means a big difference.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   Better graphics process.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.600]   Yeah, it does.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.440]   And I really think the camera is going to be noticeably better.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.400]   What else is different?
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.480]   Oh, you can squeeze it.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.240]   Oh, come on.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.240]   That's big.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.240]   No, I'm very skeptical.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.240]   No, what happens with the case?
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   No, the case.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.800]   So the case, if you buy the case from Google, they've designed it to accommodate the squeeze.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   And they say they could distinguish as an accidental squeeze from an intentional squeeze.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.200]   And the squeeze launches Google Assistant.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.640]   So I kind of think that's a smart one.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.000]   Or do I thought it could do other things too?
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.600]   I thought it could you could you could.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.600]   Well, she did that.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:17.320]   She gave was she squeezed it and then says, take a selfie.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.880]   And it immediately goes to the camera.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.880]   And literally two seconds later goes three, two, and takes a selfie.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.840]   That's pretty that's a good application right there.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.960]   Or what's the weather going to be?
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.160]   Or what time is it?
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.400]   Or set an appointment for tomorrow at 4.30 to get a haircut?
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.880]   That will be fairly useful, I think.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.480]   I'm skeptical again because that seems like a weird gesture.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.280]   We've talked about this on and on.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.520]   It's an intuitive simple gesture that kind of comes naturally.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.520]   That could be a big breakthrough.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.800]   We need a good way to launch an assistant that doesn't involve turning on the phone or
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.560]   saying things or whatever.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.320]   I think the squeeze has the potential being very good.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320]   I'm excited.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   I can't wait.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.040]   Talk to me at the end of October.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   Yes.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.400]   We all the older system.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.920]   I just try to do it with my old assistant.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.120]   I don't want the existing phone won't do it.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   Take a selfie.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   Oh, I thought it.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.120]   Yeah, no.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   Really?
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120]   It's not doing it for me.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.840]   I don't know why.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   Why is mine red?
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.680]   I mean, while my Google hold this saying I can't do that yet.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   Stacy watch.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.480]   I love it when Stacy gets excited.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   This is like the old breaking news.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.680]   Stacy has the noise.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   Stacy gasped.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.920]   We must hear the pause of the gasp.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.920]   Play Taylor Swift.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.920]   Oh, it's my man.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920]   I'm Rover.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:45.880]   Are you talking to your dot?
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.480]   Yes, it's not playing it on the right speaker.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   It is.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   That is big.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.160]   I can't wait to go home and do that.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.160]   That's nice.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.160]   That's really great.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.160]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.160]   Sorry, you guys.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.880]   I've been waiting for like eight, nine a year even.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880]   So.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.600]   Google is once again giving you free unlimited original quality storage for your photos
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.400]   and even 4K videos.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.400]   That's nice.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.640]   They show some pretty impressive image stabilization.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.760]   They have OIS and what they call EIS.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:24.040]   The EIS is camera stabilization, video stabilization, software technology.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.960]   So on the left, the shaky cam is without OIS and EIS on the right.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   That's only on this phone, not on the old.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.520]   This is on the Pixel 2.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.960]   It requires hardware with OIS.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   Right.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.320]   Can we talk about what Google didn't talk about briefly?
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.320]   Because this is part of that.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.360]   All this camera stuff.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:50.560]   Clearly, Google has done something on the chip side related to AI and processing that
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:57.920]   is as good as, if not better than what they, A11 Bionics chip that Apple has done.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.840]   Why do you say that?
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.920]   Because the type of stuff that they're doing and the processing they're doing on the phone
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.880]   is phenomenal.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.800]   We're talking both the image recognition, the amount of computational power it takes to
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.920]   stitch together images like that, the image stabilization.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.600]   And when you look at what they hinted at it briefly with the clip, and we'll talk about
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.920]   that in a second.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:30.040]   But I don't know why they didn't dig into this because I am insanely curious about what
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.680]   they've done on the silicon side.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.680]   So sorry.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.560]   I'm like, why didn't they brush it?
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.200]   Aren't they just using stock Snapdragon chips?
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.200]   Are they doing custom?
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.200]   They are.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:46.880]   So they are using Snapdragon, but I think there's definitely some sort of either co-process,
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.480]   not a co-processor, would be its own.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.000]   Something else going on.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   Yes.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.040]   I think there's got to be something else going on.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.480]   So this is my bet.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.120]   I look at all of this, like that image stabilization.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.280]   And I'm like, Qualcomm has some lovely image stabilization for drones.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.360]   So I know they've got it.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:10.400]   But this, when you take it to the clip form factor, there's something.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.640]   But this is where Google's going to win.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.680]   Unless some of these other companies really get it together.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.680]   They have more data than anybody else.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.840]   They are all in on artificial intelligence and machine learning in the face of people
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.200]   saying, oh, gosh, this is Skynet or we don't want Google to know all this stuff.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.360]   They're not slowing down.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.360]   They're saying, nope.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.360]   They're saying, no, you're not going to do that.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360]   They're saying, no, you're not going to do that.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.360]   You're not going to do that.

[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   You're not going to do that.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   Let me just do the Google keynote and watch the Google 2 event.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.860]   In 19 minutes, I bet you somewhere, this is the Verge's cut down.
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:29.360]   I bet you somewhere in the 19 minutes, we're going to find this translation.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.360]   There's that lovely lady on stage, the Swedish lady.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360]   Yeah, the Swedish.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360]   She brings her as a Swedish friend.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360]   Here we go.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360]   Here we go.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360]   So do you have my audio?
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.360]   All right.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   But I got to turn it on.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.000]   It's an incredible application of Google Translate powered by machine learning that's
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.360]   like having a personal translator by your side.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.240]   Isabelle is going to speak Swedish into her Pixel Buds and I'll hear the English translation
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.960]   out of Pixel 2's front speakers.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:05.640]   And then I'll respond in English and show here the Swedish translation in her Pixel Buds.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.960]   So let me make this clear what's going to go on.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:14.240]   Because it isn't immediately obvious the way it sounds on the recording.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.720]   But she's got earbuds.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.400]   So she's going to hear what he's saying in Swedish.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.480]   We won't hear that part.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:25.320]   And then when she speaks in Swedish, the phone will hear it and translate it into English,
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.880]   which he will hear.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.600]   But it's not clear to hear the sound.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.960]   So she's holding a Pixel 2 and she's got the Pixel earbuds in the...
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.760]   Well, I've done this with the phone itself.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   Yes.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.400]   And you pass it back and forth kind of.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.840]   But this isn't much more natural.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.760]   And look how fast it is.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760]   Hey, Isabelle.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]   Hooray, lage.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   Here, okay, Pach.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.760]   Absolutely, okay.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.760]   Thank you.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.560]   Now, it's hard to tell because they're played back through the PA speakers.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.040]   They screwed this demo up a little bit.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.520]   They should have played it back for us to hear it.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:59.200]   But it's coming through her Pixel phone when it comes out in English.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.920]   And note that she has to press the button on the side.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.960]   Which makes sense because it says, "Listen, now I'm going to speak.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:05.960]   I want you to translate this."
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.160]   It doesn't make us listen to you all the time and all that.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.000]   Let's watch it a little more.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.820]   What do you think of these cool new headphones?
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.740]   So, it's cool.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:27.800]   So, that is... that is as close as you can get to...
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.220]   The Biblefish.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.880]   It's the U.N. style simultaneous translation.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:37.120]   It's not quite simultaneous, but it's very, very quick.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.680]   So, you could have a conversation faster, in fact, than the phone translator, I think,
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.640]   by a little bit even, right?
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.600]   And yes, so I want to...
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.800]   I cannot wait to try this out with my daughter who speaks Spanish.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.800]   And I don't...
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.360]   Because I'm very curious, like, I don't speak Swedish.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.920]   I have no idea the quality of the translation or kind of...
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.480]   Because sometimes, you know, Google Translate gets exciting for people.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.640]   But I'm still like...
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.560]   I'm so excited about this.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.560]   I think this could be...
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.560]   This is almost magic.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.560]   It could be magic.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.560]   It really...
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.080]   I remember way back when, at...
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:20.480]   Pardon me for this, Davos, when Eric Schmidt demonstrated this the first time.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.880]   And Schmidt said, "This will bring world peace."
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.880]   If only.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.360]   That sounds like overstatement, and I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.880]   But it's a big deal.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   But it's a big deal.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.520]   Translate Donald Trump to Kim Jong-un.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.520]   It's...
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.520]   Then, okay.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.520]   Maybe if we could intercede a little bit and...
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520]   Oh, you fool.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   Don't do this.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.520]   Please, don't do that.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:45.360]   Google's Pixel Buds are much like the Apple AirPods in that they have a separate case
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.320]   cloth covered, though, to distinguish it from Apple.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.960]   And the case has its own battery.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:55.200]   So the Pixel Buds, just like the AirPods, have five hours of listening time.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.520]   And the case has another few charges in it.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.840]   So they say 24 hours when you include the case.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.680]   I think that's very good.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.840]   But it is a full Google Assistant.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.480]   That sounds like a really nice marriage.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.920]   And since you don't, in fact, have a headphone jack, you kind of need wireless headphones.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.440]   It will work with other Bluetooth headphones, but that special translation stuff and all
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:20.200]   that stuff requires a Pixel 2.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.040]   Is the cord...
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.800]   Does it carry charge between the two?
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.880]   No, it looks like it's just a physical cord to hold them together.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:31.360]   So you have two Bluetooth connections at once?
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.640]   Does each ear have a Bluetooth connection to the phone?
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.040]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040]   That is an interesting question.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.920]   Other ones, and I can't remember how Apple does it.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.960]   One does, and then it sends, and then it talks to the other one through your head.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.840]   Well, we'll see.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.680]   But maybe it does use that cord.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   Not clear.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.920]   It's not clear.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.520]   You do have to...
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.200]   The touch piece is only on the right ear.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.480]   And is that all it does is touch?
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.160]   Or are there multiple commands?
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.120]   Yeah, there's multiple... sweep forward or backward for volume control, touch to activate
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.120]   the assistant.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.880]   I think those are the two they demonstrated.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.880]   There may be more.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.480]   My problem with that always is because they fall out of my damn deers, I want to push it
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.680]   in and of course I activate.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.960]   Google Assistant on the Google Pixel Buzz is only available on Android and requires an
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.640]   assistant-enabled Android device and data connection.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.800]   So I take it back.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:31.000]   It does not require a Pixel, but it does require a phone that does Google Assistant.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.520]   So that may be a more limited subset, I'm not sure.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.440]   That was, I thought, really an exciting part of all this.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:45.160]   I think the pencil- circling things and getting assistant to respond on the Pixelbook and
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:51.120]   then these buds doing the simultaneous translation were two of the highlights as far as I was
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.120]   concerned.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.320]   Then they announced something that was a little weird.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.600]   But Stacey is going to explain this all to us.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.200]   They call it the Google Clips.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.400]   And this one, people didn't know what it was.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.560]   They saw the word Google Clips in the something.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.400]   I can't remember firmware or whatever, but nobody really knew what it was.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:17.960]   It's a standalone wide-angle camera with 16 gigs of storage.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.200]   You don't wear it.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:27.240]   You put it somewhere and it decides what to capture and it gets smarter over time, they
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.240]   say.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:34.320]   They get 10 stills so they get seconds of motion in front of an after.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:42.240]   There is no audio and it does not upload it to the cloud until you tell it to for privacy
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.240]   reasons.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.280]   You see, in this picture, the two girls are playing, they're doing Lego and on the pillow
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.840]   is the camera sitting on the pillow spying on you.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.200]   Do something cute, girls.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.240]   I don't know how it knows where to take pictures.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.240]   No, I know.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:05.800]   So this is cool/creepy/ it would be awesome if you think about it getting embedded into
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.960]   the devices like the Nest cams.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.360]   So what it's looking for, it talked about looking for people you care about, right?
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.760]   So it's recognizing cases.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.200]   It's recognizing people as bats.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:21.880]   But it also recognizes when people stand still, it recognizes smiles.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:27.400]   So there's a lot happening here that is actually really hard to do.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.840]   I mean, computer vision and image recognition like this is not insignificant, even if it's
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.240]   only a few models that it's running.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.240]   Like, recognizing faces, each face is a model.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:44.000]   And then recognizing when people smile in a dog or cat.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   So it's kind of creepy, but it's not so cool.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.040]   If you just put this, like if I put this here during the show, and then what happens is
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.080]   you take your phone and you say, okay, let me see what you got.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.120]   And you can swipe through it and say, save that one, save that one.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.800]   So it's not saving everything to the cloud unless you say so.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.520]   But imagine if it got 10 really interesting shots.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.080]   I think that could be really cool.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:15.360]   But so you got to remember to put it somewhere.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.080]   Yes, but imagine that on drones.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.880]   So think about something like that on drones.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.720]   Or just throw it in the house or I like what you said if it's on the nest cams.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.200]   And it just says, you had an interesting day.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.680]   Let me show you some of the things you did.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.520]   I think two things going on with this, which is admittedly a kind of a strange device,
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.360]   which may become awesome all in its own.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.520]   I don't know.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:44.120]   But I think there is whatever AI hardware stuff is happening under the hood that Google's
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.400]   not talking to us about.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.600]   I think that's part of this design.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.560]   And they did talk about like how to do it in such a small form factor.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.200]   I think they're spreading that out across as many of devices as possible.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:01.680]   So it can they can understand how it works, tune the algorithms better and get the cost
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.320]   down on something like this.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.320]   So this is a research.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.320]   This is a recent.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320]   Yeah, it's 250 bucks.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.560]   Can't buy it today, but you can get on the waitlist.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.000]   But it's more a research project than anything else.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.720]   They're going to learn from doing this.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   250.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.000]   And then it could be somewhere else.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.920]   That's my quote unquote conspiracy theory around clip or the clip or whatever.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.840]   I think if they were good, I mean, we, there are a lot of unknown, but no, I think that's
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   exactly.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   I think you nailed it.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.840]   Stacy, of course, that's what they're doing.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.840]   That's what they always do.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:29.840]   Nailed it.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.840]   Nailed it.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.320]   But I think even 250 isn't that much.
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:38.320]   If you think about what you might get out of this, especially if you're a family and you
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.200]   don't, you know, the worst, my kids always hated me because I was always taking pictures
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.960]   and they would always go, no, don't take pictures, stop it.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.840]   So I never, I didn't get a lot of good pictures, but if you just put this thing unobtrusively
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.880]   and let's let it sit there and at the end of the evening, you looked at what you got,
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.440]   you might get some, it depends.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.320]   It's really good to depend on what you get, what the quality is, what the images look
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320]   like.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.920]   But if it works as promised, I can see that I can see that's worth 250.
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.960]   Well, you get 60 seconds of the burglar.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.960]   Come on.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.840]   I have to, but he asking me if I'm going to buy one isn't, isn't demonstrative of anything
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.280]   because I have to buy it.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.880]   Well, no, I'm going to buy all of this because I have to talk about it and review.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.280]   And if this thing is terrible, I want to get it so that I could tell people, no, no,
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.280]   no, really, this doesn't do what anything is promised.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:24.560]   Or on the other hand, if it does, I might be able to say, Hey, this is, believe it or
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.040]   not, this is something you really want to get.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:28.360]   So you know what would be interesting?
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.520]   So think about like, I'm just thinking about my daughter and how she uses technology and
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.280]   how she communicates with her friends via silly kind of fun things.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:43.560]   And I wonder if I'm a teenage girl or a kid how this fits in kind of with the Snapchat
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.120]   generation, right?
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.120]   Right.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.240]   And that actually might be kind of fun.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.240]   I mean, I don't.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.240]   That is very interesting.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.080]   So yeah.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:57.080]   So maybe it's like those, when I was growing up, I had my first camera was like this little
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.440]   pink look click that took the crappiest pictures ever.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.520]   But I love that thing.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.720]   Here's a, here's a happy Google family using their Google clip.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.880]   It says, be in the moment.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.400]   That's the point, right?
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.360]   With the people matter most, instead of dad annoying everybody by taking pictures and
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   really not being a part of it, you just put that on the flower bag, you leave it there,
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.040]   and then you just do what you do.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.040]   And then at the end of it, you see what you get.
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.080]   And if you get, look, you don't have to get a lot.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:32.120]   If you've got a few good images that are keepers, that's all you need, right?
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.720]   It doesn't have a button and you can force how do you know that you, that you're not
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.280]   cutting off your kid's head.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.680]   Well, supposedly, it's very wide angle and that's why it's very wide angle.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.440]   That's going to be one of the negatives is it's all the pictures are going to be a very
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.920]   wide angle pictures.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.480]   But I mean, judging by these shots, I think it's actually no.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.520]   I think look, they must be doing something.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.320]   They're assuming then.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:29:00.000]   Oh, that might be because these people do not look.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.280]   If you had a, if you had a 4K camera on here, which you might, I mean, the sensors are
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280]   cheap enough.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280]   You're right.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.080]   I mean, that's a, this third picture in with the guy playing basketball with this kid.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.880]   That's wide angle.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.320]   They put it on the basketball.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:15.320]   I don't know.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.320]   That's it.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.320]   We'll see.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320]   That's why we have to get one and review it.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.520]   If I were a civilian, I would wait to read the reviews before I buy it, but I, you know,
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.520]   I'm not.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.280]   So we need, we need 130 degree field of view.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.280]   That's pretty wide.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.000]   15 frames per second.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.320]   Where's the specs?
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.320]   They don't say what the sensor is.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.320]   No, they don't.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.680]   It's a fairly slow sensor.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:44.040]   It's F2, 4, F2, 6, but it's F2, 4, but they don't say much about it.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.440]   This is, I think Stacy, you're right.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.680]   This is a, this is a stealth project.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.800]   They're trying to get into people's hands so they can learn more about this.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.920]   But I think you nailed it when you said this could easily be applied to Nest.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680]   No.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.680]   The Nest does that by the way.
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.120]   The Nest zooms in because it's a 4K sensor on the, on the new Nest IQ.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.120]   It zooms.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.120]   And so.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.920]   And the software that it gives you lets you pick out cute moments.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.440]   It shows you what's interesting.
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.440]   Right.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.440]   And it, no, it learns you people.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:16.040]   It learns who's, who's who and will warn you if it sees somebody it hasn't seen before.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.080]   It has a lot of this smarts in it.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.200]   I bet you they're related.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200]   So that's the clips.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:27.800]   They also announced a new a daydream form factor for 99 bucks, which is just a little
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.120]   bit improved over the existing daydream.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.840]   That is a massive, massive product dump.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:33.840]   That's a lot of product.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.440]   And add the Nest stuff last week.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.440]   Yep.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.440]   Go ahead.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:43.440]   So I have to ask though, because I, I saw their AR stickers demo and I was stunned that
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.040]   they spent so much freaking time on.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040]   Stupid.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.920]   So no, well, am I old?
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:53.840]   I kind of wanted to get my daughter to explain this because I'm like, it's dopey.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.880]   It's the same reason Apple spent a similar amount of time on animated emojis using the
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.480]   camera system and you make funny faces.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:06.800]   I think both of these companies, look, you're no older than the people at Google.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.400]   They're both, they don't, they don't know either.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.960]   They just notice all these kids using Snapchat filters.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.240]   And so what can we do?
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.040]   I don't think it's that important.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.200]   I think it's Florence Ion said this morning when we were covering the stream.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.480]   And by the way, we do have, if you want to watch the stream, we have a, a Twitch special
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.880]   where Florence and I comment as it goes on during the event this morning.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:32.480]   But she said, you know, this is kind of thing you use once and never use again.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.480]   Okay.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.360]   That's, that's how I didn't even want to use it once.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.360]   Right.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.360]   So.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.360]   And it's not that new.
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:44.560]   We've seen this kind of placing a thing in augmented reality before.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.200]   So there you go.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.040]   If you include the pencil, it's actually even more new products.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.120]   One, two, three, four, fives.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.560]   It's a ton.
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:57.520]   It's a ton of new stuff from Google.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:02.240]   And I think, well, let me, before I say what I think, what do you guys, what do you think,
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:06.920]   Jeff, what is, is this, what does this, what does it tell us about Google's ambitions?
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.760]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:12.160]   I was hoping you're going to stay C first.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.880]   I think, I think you're right about the ecosystem.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.320]   I think that that Google recognizes it has to be in the hardware business.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.520]   It needs to provide an ecosystem.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:27.120]   You need to live with assistant needs to provide, you know, assistant across all these
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.120]   platforms.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:32.400]   Nobody else is going to build it in for them, build it well.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.040]   So you know, and building the best phone they can and the best laptop they can.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.560]   I'm personally glad they're still doing that.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.600]   When we thought the pixel was dead.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.160]   The only thing is when they thought the pixel was dead, I went on eBay.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   I can only find one.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.160]   I bought it.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.160]   Wow.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:53.120]   Because I was so the, the, the, the Chromebook pixel because I was so addicted to it.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:57.000]   And I had, I had the version one in my office in New York.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.960]   And it was just to get too slow.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.360]   So I have to grow up with pixels because I love it that much.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.360]   Stacy.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:05.360]   Sorry, Stacy.
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.360]   That's okay.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.360]   I love my people.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.360]   Stacy and people love my pixel.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.440]   Jeff is not alone.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.200]   The people who love their pixels love them.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   I mean, and I know a lot of them.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200]   Could you?
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.200]   A lot of Google.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.200]   I love my, I love my pixel.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:23.960]   So I think it's, I think it's a good, I think it's an impressive.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:30.040]   And, and you know, here's a question.
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:34.360]   What's more impressive today's Google announcement or the Apple announcements of late?
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.200]   Oh, Google for sure.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.200]   Times a thousand.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.200]   Wow.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.200]   Okay.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.360]   That's a, that's a big deal.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:48.040]   I think I mean, Leo's worrying about the, the assassin hits are going to come up a family.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.320]   I think Apple, you know, we really thought Apple would going to be all in on augmented
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:56.280]   reality and there'd be a lot to say about augmented reality on their event.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.280]   And there wasn't.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.640]   They just didn't mention much at all.
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:04.160]   It wasn't, it wasn't any higher quality what Google did today with a, the, the, the
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.080]   stranger things animal.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:10.000]   I, you know, I don't, I think Apple's a little bit disappointing.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.360]   They, they announced phones and they announced phones that are incrementally better than
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.600]   their existing phones.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:20.760]   Even the, like this, like this, the iPhone 10.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:22.360]   We know they want an ecosystem.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.880]   They didn't even talk about at their event.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.520]   They didn't even talk about their home pod.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.760]   So they missed out with the biggest architectural shift is in computing today, which is computing
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.960]   is about context.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:41.640]   It's about an ecosystem of things that are helping you get stuff done in a phone that
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.160]   is incrementally better is not the vision forward.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:50.680]   The vision forward is things like, Hey, when my pixel Chromebook gets next to my, whatever
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.560]   pixel phone, it automatically tethers and Apple's done a little bit of that in the past.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:01.920]   But things like series, like when they announced their stuff, I wanted Siri to be so much better.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.320]   I was waiting for that.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.760]   And until series good, the home pod is going to suck.
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:10.480]   And I look at what Google's done.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.280]   They've done a very, I mean, I was Kevin and I were joking.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.640]   We were talking about like every time someone says machine learning drink, but they really
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:25.440]   have done a good job integrating the computational power that these all of these things now have
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.680]   access to in really creating a really compelling product in a new vision for how we're going
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.720]   to use devices.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.120]   And I think that's super impressive.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.120]   This is the future.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.880]   And it feels like Apple is kind of like not with it.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   I don't know.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:49.240]   I would say, I agree with you, but I what I the way I would phrase it is Apple has intentionally
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:58.120]   chosen to value user privacy over gathering the data necessary for machine learning.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:01.920]   Wait, wait, wait, as a result, they're in the end, I'll argue.
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:04.000]   That's because they're not in the ad business.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.520]   It's not, it's not an altruistic act.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:13.880]   It's just that they're turning a bug into a feature in their business model.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:21.600]   But I think it's that they're doubling down on it because there is a large segment, maybe
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.880]   growing, maybe even majority segment of people who are concerned about Google.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.760]   We won't get to talk about it today because we're running out of time, but I really wanted
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.520]   to and we'll do it next week, talk about we spent some time on Sunday talking about it
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:41.920]   about the professor who wrote that Silicon Valley is, has lost its shine and get ready
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:46.840]   because governments are about to super regulate companies like Google because of these privacy
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.840]   concerns.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.960]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:50.960]   Gallows piece.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:51.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.120]   I, I, this is if it weren't for this Google event, we would have spent the last hour and
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.080]   a half talking about that.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.080]   But next week.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:03.520]   And we'll actually have a triangulation with him on the 20th.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.160]   How exciting.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.800]   So Professor Gallows will be on, is his name Gallows?
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.960]   Or am I something like that?
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:11.960]   Galloway.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960]   Galloway.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.960]   Okay.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.600]   I accidentally turned it into a hangman.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:19.560]   Professor Galloway, but he is kind of saying, get ready because the hangman's noose is coming
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.840]   for you, Silicon Valley.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.480]   So we'll hear from him on triangulation.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.040]   I wrote a piece too that I put up on the next week.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.040]   Yes.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.560]   But, but arguing that that they have to go out of their way to be virtuous and they're
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.560]   not there.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.560]   Right.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.240]   I think it's quite the opposite.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:43.240]   I think Google has decided to double down that they're, they're going to look at apples
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:44.240]   doing privacy.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.160]   They're all in on privacy.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   Great news for us.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:50.440]   We can win now.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:53.840]   And yes, sorry, someone stuck a thing on here.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.120]   It was Ronamario who's smart and lovely.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120]   From Mars.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.720]   His review of the Pixel 2 and 2 XL.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.720]   One's nice.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:01.720]   One's not.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.720]   So I bought the two.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.600]   I'll be honest because I have tiny hands and they're not tiny.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.200]   Which one did he think was nice or not?
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.080]   He thought the two XL was nicer because of the bezel.
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.240]   But they're the same corners.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:17.800]   As Google put was great pains to point out the same internals.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.800]   It's what he says.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.200]   Basically, he says the big one, of course.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.200]   Okay.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:27.480]   He basically says it's uglier, but I don't know what a chamfered edge is.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.040]   So I kind of feel like this is a very gadget oriented.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.480]   Well, and also remember, this is Ron based on what he experienced for 15 minutes this
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.480]   morning.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.580]   This is not a review.
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:38.080]   This is a hands on.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.080]   Right.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.080]   Right.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.080]   If it runs, I mean, Ron's a good dude.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.080]   Oh, I love Ron.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.080]   He knows his stuff.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.600]   No, no, I love Ron.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.520]   But I don't, this is not a review.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.680]   This is just here.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.160]   Here's what I experienced that when I held it.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.320]   So the hardware is exactly the same.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.600]   Maybe there is a look at feel that's, I kind of agree with him.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.600]   I think.
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:01.000]   There is not the same.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]   What's not?
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000]   Well, the internals.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   Oh, like the, oh, sorry.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   Okay.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.040]   The processor, the camera, the camera, the screens are different ones.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:12.680]   LCD ones, P O led, but the internals are the same.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.040]   So you're not getting a slower phone.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.680]   Google pointed that out.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.400]   You're just getting a different phone.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.080]   And I mean, I, that's this purely subjective, which one looks better to you.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.240]   I think that's subjective.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:26.240]   I don't think that that's a, it's going to function the same.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.880]   It's going to have the same speed, the same smarts, the same photography skills.
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:34.480]   It's just whether you like big ears or not on your screen and we've, you know, all of
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:39.280]   us, we've had phones that looked like this all our lives until now.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.680]   This is only now that we're getting bezelless phones.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.400]   I kind of agree with him that I prefer a bezel is fun, but not, but I think if you want a
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.760]   smaller phone, Stacy, you're not going to be unhappy.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:49.920]   I will not be unhappy.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:51.760]   No, I don't think that's a problem.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.200]   He says, he says the bezels are massive and awkward, but no, they're exactly the
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.800]   same as the bezels on the current.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:58.800]   Look at the current.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.520]   Show it over my shoulder.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.600]   The current iPhone eight and the current pixel XL.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.280]   When did this suddenly become, you know, unacceptable?
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.640]   This is, this is what we, uh, why can I get my screen turned on here?
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:14.360]   This is what we've been living with all this time.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.720]   I am highly fashionable.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.320]   So maybe I'll care about bezels.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.320]   I don't know.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:23.320]   Um, no, I do think that in a couple of years having big ears on a screen will look kind
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320]   of silly.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.960]   But by the way, I should point out one of the negatives to me on this new pixel book is
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.800]   while we're seeing many laptops with virtually no bezel on the screen, these at the pixel
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:41.600]   book has big, big bezels on the, on the, cause it wrapped its antenna, it's antennae around.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.120]   Maybe I don't know what, I don't know what the argument is for it, but it is, I don't
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.000]   think it's, I don't think it's particularly, if you look at this compared to most modern
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.960]   laptops, I don't think it's particularly attractive.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.280]   Frankly, look at the size of the bezels.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:41:01.000]   This looks like an old fashioned laptop with those bezels.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.920]   So but that's a purely subjective, you know, a design or a taste thing.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:09.440]   I don't think that that, I don't think you would be unhappy with the pixel.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.520]   It looks very much like my present.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.800]   I mean, my, my current, you know, choice of laptops or windows laptops, most of them
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.880]   have much thinner bezels in this, but that's fine.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:28.040]   Good, well, I will read his hands on, but I don't think it's caused to, to, for concern,
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.800]   if you've already ordered the little one.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.800]   We didn't talk about that.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:32.800]   Oh, I'm not concerned.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.800]   We didn't talk about Google lens.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.800]   They've been showing this since Google goggles.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.640]   I was just going to ask about that.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:45.560]   The demos looked good, but until we have it, you can't really say much about it.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.840]   I, I think we got to take a break and get your final picks.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:51.840]   Of the week.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.840]   Is she?
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.840]   And in just a moment, but first a word from our sponsors, captera.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:01.880]   People call me all the time on the radio show and say, I have a business and I need some
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.720]   software for my yoga studio or my dental practice or my contractors business.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.000]   And I say, I don't know what you should.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.080]   And you know, most of the time people will just Google this, you know, what's the best
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.440]   contractor software?
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:15.960]   I got a better idea.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:22.120]   Go to captera, C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A dot com slash twig.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:28.320]   Captera lets you find the business software you need hundreds of thousands of programs
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:36.760]   in 400 categories with the reviews with the information you need to make a smart choice.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:37.760]   What are you looking for?
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:43.360]   Alumni management software, audit software, augmented reality software, bar coding software,
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:47.200]   bug tracking software, call center software, catering.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.720]   Let's do catering.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:49.720]   Catering software.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:50.720]   I have a catering business.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.720]   I need some software.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.000]   Do you have some choices?
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.640]   57 results.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.600]   Cateries, total party playing, gather, better cater.
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:02.280]   This is kind of one of the things that's kind of kept there, opened my eyes to how much
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.360]   vertical business software there is.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:06.920]   But that maybe is a little bit overwhelming.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:12.440]   So what if we say, well, I only want to see four stars and up and let's have it be web
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:13.680]   based.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:19.560]   I would love it if it would allow me to manage events, facilities, inventory and customers.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.560]   How about that?
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.800]   Now we'll filter the results.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.040]   And well, we got it down to four products.
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:32.760]   Let's add to compare, add to compare, add to compare, add to compare monkey software.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:33.920]   I like that.
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.880]   And now I can take these products and I can look at a chart created just for me on captera.com
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.080]   slash twig that says who uses a software?
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.660]   What's the target customer size?
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.040]   How much it costs?
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.640]   Is there a free trial?
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.200]   What platforms it runs on?
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.480]   What it can do?
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:56.040]   And then you get the reviews, reviews from real users, hundreds of thousands of reviews
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.600]   from real users.
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:59.360]   They're very careful to vet these.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.880]   So you're going to get the information you need to make exactly the right choice on the
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.840]   business software you need.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:07.880]   And best of all, it's absolutely free.
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:10.040]   There's no sign up, no salesman will call.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.320]   You won't get emails from captera.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.480]   This is a software solution for every business need and it costs you absolutely nothing.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:19.160]   And my question to you is, why are you googling it?
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.360]   Why are you calling the tech guy?
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:29.920]   Just go to captera.com slash twig and find the right business software for free 200,000
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.720]   reviews by actual users vetted.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:35.920]   I love that.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.360]   Go to captera.com slash twig.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.200]   Three million people use it every month.
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.640]   That's a great service they provide.
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:44.920]   Well I wish we had some more time.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.400]   There's so much more to talk about.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.720]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   Your fault.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.720]   Jeff, I'm getting hungry.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:51.720]   You're fine.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.040]   It's a very hit an hour and 43 minutes.
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.160]   It's not a short show by any means.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.120]   But there are so many things I wanted to talk about.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.840]   The fake news that surfaced on both Google and Facebook safety check page after the horrific
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.080]   Vegas shootings, that's a problem.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:12.680]   I know you have some things to say about journalism.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:19.080]   In particular, what was it that I saw, oh, Jeff's going to want to talk about this?
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.560]   Well, I can't remember.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.720]   But guess what?
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.280]   We get together every week so we can talk about it and we will.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:26.800]   I'll be coming on from Berlin next week.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:29.040]   What are you doing in Berlin?
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.880]   Speaking at a newspaper digital conference.
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.840]   Oh, Facebook's revealing that there are some other Russian ads now.
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.120]   Is this enough?
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.120]   I want to see this.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.640]   Yeah, I wrote a piece arguing that they need to do more.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:42.440]   That's what I'd say.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:46.440]   With their news, moral authority is a platform, right?
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:51.320]   Jeff, we shall read more about it and then talk.
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.320]   Discuss for next week.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:55.240]   Jeff, you got a number for us this week?
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.640]   Yes, I do.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:07.720]   So Google has now also announced a Street View Ready program and there's a camera now for
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.160]   $3,500.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.160]   You can make your own Street View and you can contribute images to Google Street View.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.160]   Why would I?
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.960]   I'm not 100% why you do that.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.080]   Actually, you can make a business out of it, couldn't you?
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:22.040]   Well, they're not paying you for it.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.040]   I guess what you could do.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.040]   No, no, no, no, you go.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:31.320]   Remember when we had an internal Street View done of our business, this is auto ready.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.280]   This is, you put it in your car.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:34.280]   It's got an amount in it.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.880]   I don't know what the business would be for that.
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:37.400]   Maybe you could map a campus.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:38.960]   Google's going to have loaders.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:42.440]   Yeah, so it's fairly weird.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:50.160]   It's a 360 degree 8K camera, the Insta360 and you loaded up the streets for parks.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.240]   It's for private and private places that Google can't get into.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.240]   Right?
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:58.240]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.080]   It was a little odd.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:06.760]   I thought it was kind of freaky because I hate the idea of getting caught.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:10.760]   I mean, I hate the idea of getting caught on a Street View camera, but this will increase
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:13.720]   the number of the velocity of the...
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.960]   Creep view.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.960]   It's the new Creep View feature.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:19.960]   I don't know.
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.360]   I don't want to mark a car up or anything.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.280]   You just surreptitiously drive around like right, right?
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:25.280]   Hmm.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.880]   I'm gonna van you won't even see it.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.280]   What if they sold that to law enforcement, to police departments?
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.520]   Would you or governments?
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:38.960]   Well, that is a real concern about when we put cameras on city buses or anything else.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.560]   How do we govern that data use?
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:42.560]   Hmm.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.760]   Okay.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.760]   The number is 35.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:45.760]   Oh, no.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:46.760]   It's a number.
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:47.760]   It's a number.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:48.760]   No, it's a good number.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:49.760]   It's a number.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.600]   Stacey Higginbotham, your pick of the week.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.480]   I have a thing to show you.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:59.680]   This isn't exactly a pick as many of my things are not picks.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.400]   They're just things.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.600]   This is the August Smart Lock.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.120]   This is the new base model.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:11.400]   So this is the cheapest August that you can buy for, I think it's $149.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.080]   It's Bluetooth enabled and Nest enabled, but it doesn't.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.320]   You have to spend the additional, I think it's $79 for the bridge if you want it not to
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:26.440]   work with Bluetooth or if you want it to work over Wi-Fi and have like, metal A or whatever
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.440]   on it.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.120]   But as locks go, this is actually really impressive.
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.360]   It is very sturdy hardware.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.040]   It looks like it.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:40.120]   It is like this lock weighs at least a pound.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:43.200]   I mean, it is kind of ridiculous, I'll be honest.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:49.040]   So it also comes, I didn't see the door sensor in here.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.040]   Oh, no bits in there.
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:53.080]   So it comes with their new, they launched something called door sense.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.680]   So if your door is kind of a jar, but the lock is closed, it no longer will say, hey,
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.680]   your door is locked.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:01.200]   It'll say your door is a jar.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:05.520]   So I just wanted to show y'all because it's hefty.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:08.560]   It's a new form factor for the August.
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:11.120]   And that's kind of that.
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.240]   The other one is on my door, so it's working.
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:16.720]   So yeah, that's what this is.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.160]   The back looks like this.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.840]   What you do is you'll take your deadbolt out, just the deadbolt part.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.320]   You leave the locking mechanism in.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:32.760]   You stick this on the thing you remove from the front.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.880]   So the back, your key lock stays the same.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:35.880]   You stick that on.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:41.400]   And then what you'll do is these have little wings and you'll just mount it on.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:47.440]   It takes like possibly not even 10 minutes really to install.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:53.240]   So I prefer to install my entire lock to swap out my entire lock, but people do like
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:59.160]   this and it's the most popular, I think smart home walk out there or something.
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.160]   I don't know.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.720]   I'm going to have to take a look at it because I've been resistant to the idea of automated
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:04.720]   locks.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:05.720]   You're right.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.320]   They can just break the door down.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320]   I mean, I'm not.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.920]   I mean, if you want to hack my door, be easier to stick it in.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.680]   It would honestly, my door has a window next to it.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.240]   You could just break the window in.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.920]   Yeah, no, that's a good point.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.200]   A lock is just a suggestion.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:28.440]   I've also, this is not really a thing, but this is a thing because I bought it for eight
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.440]   bucks.
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.880]   Your price risks towels.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:36.200]   If you don't want, also there's a sweat band, but I did not wear that because that's hot.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:39.040]   But I bought it to cover my Fitbit for two things.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:43.640]   One in the middle of the night, it glows whenever I move, it thinks I need to see the
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:46.280]   time and my husband gets cranky about it.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:53.120]   So it puts it up, but it also, I've done kettlebells for a while now and it protects
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:58.760]   your Apple watch or your kettlebell or from any sort of like, if you're working out with
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:03.560]   something that's going to hit your watch because a friend of mine cracked her Fitbit doing
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:04.560]   that.
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:06.560]   Oh, I thought you were in a belt wire.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.080]   Oh, I guess if you were doing handbells, that actually is true.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:13.560]   This is the equivalent of Russian bell, bell ringing.
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:17.560]   Anyway, I just throw in that out there for you guys because I never even really thought
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:20.600]   about them, but then I was like, hot damn.
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:25.200]   And you look like you're a gay tennis pro.
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:27.000]   Basically, yes.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000]   Yes.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.760]   You wear those to bed?
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:32.440]   No, I just wear one over my Fitbit.
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.720]   Oh, that's super comfortable.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.320]   And sporty too.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.480]   They're rain, rain, though.
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:40.680]   That's very good.
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:41.960]   Towels extremely good.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:42.960]   That's a good point.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:46.760]   If you're going to wear a sleep tracker to bed, you probably should cover it up so that
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.480]   it doesn't wake up your spouse.
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:52.080]   It's an excellent point.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:53.400]   I don't, I've been on vacation.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.400]   I'm groggy.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.560]   I have nothing to say.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.800]   I have nothing to pick except jet line.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:58.800]   You too.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.800]   I pick you guys.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:04.600]   I'll tell you, I'll pick our Twit Live special 326 if you didn't see the Google event.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:10.000]   Florence Ion and I talked all about it this morning and it's available at twit.tv/specials
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.680]   or wherever you get your podcasts.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.680]   Highly recommend it.
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:17.200]   Of course, as long as you're subscribing to shows, many want to subscribe to this.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:23.880]   This week in Google, we do it every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2030 UTC right here
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:30.680]   at twit.tv/live.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:34.520]   If you want and get the on demand version automatically, it's almost as good as Stranger
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.360]   Things and certainly is strange.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:43.160]   Stacey Egan-Botham does a podcast of her own with a wonderful Kevin Toast.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.160]   Toast.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:45.160]   Toast.
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:48.120]   He is not toasted when he does the podcast.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:50.000]   I can guarantee that.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.960]   Kevin Toofall.
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:57.400]   It's IOTpodcast.com and Stacey's newsletter is Stacey on IOT.com.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:59.760]   And don't forget her on Twitter, Gigastacey.
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.920]   Stacey, why?
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:06.120]   You'll find Mr. Jeff Jarvis at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:09.040]   He also writes frequently at Medium, his books, What Would Google Do?
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:15.000]   Public Parts, Geek, Sparing, Gifts, all about reinventing news and Gutenberg, The Geek,
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.640]   are available on Amazon and everywhere.
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:17.640]   Fine, our books are.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.080]   He's @JeffJervis on the Twitter.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.080]   Thank you, Jeff.
